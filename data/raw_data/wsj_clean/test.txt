How Do You Repay a Hero's Sacrifice?
EUREKA, Calif. -- Kelly Miller has the dream once or twice a week.
He's on patrol in Iraq, searching a white Toyota Land Cruiser. The driver lunges out and grabs Cpl. Miller's squad leader, Jason Dunham, around the neck. The Iraqi and Cpl. Dunham tumble to the ground in a ferocious hand-to-hand struggle. Cpl. Miller beats the insurgent with a police baton. Another Marine races over to help. The Iraqi drops a hand grenade.
The force of the explosion lifts Cpl. Dunham into the air, his back arching before he falls back toward the brown-dirt road.
Cpl. Miller wakes up.
Almost three years have passed since that grenade exploded for real. But the images are never far from his mind -- the insurgent, the explosion and the friend who intentionally took the brunt of a live grenade and gave his own life to save Cpl. Miller's. The adrenalin of combat, the pain of hot shrapnel, the guilt of making it home alive.


Bernanke to Speak Before Budget Panel
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's efforts to stay out of politically charged fiscal questions will be tested next week as he makes his inaugural appearance before a congressional budget committee.
Mr. Bernanke is to testify on the fiscal and economic outlook before the Senate Budget Committee Thursday, Jan. 18. Committee officials confirmed the appearance Wednesday. President George W. Bush releases his budget on Feb. 5.
Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, frequently testified and commented on budget policy, often generating great controversy, in particular for endorsing Mr. Bush's tax cuts at the Senate Budget Committee in January 2001. Mr. Bernanke, who took office in February last year, has said he does not want to comment on specific tax and spending proposals, saying those are the purview of Congress and the administration.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D., N.D.), who confirmed Mr. Bernanke's appearance, said the Fed chief "doesn't want to get into this specific spending program, this specific revenue program. I think he thinks that's not his purpose."
Mr. Conrad, an outspoken critic of Mr. Bush's fiscal policies, added, "It's entirely reasonable for him to talk about effects on the economy [of] deficits and growing debt, to give us an economic outlook -- that's entirely appropriate."


Bank of America Targets Barrier to Growth
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
Bank of America Corp. , arguing that U.S. banks are artificially small and vulnerable to foreign acquirers, has begun a quiet push to raise the regulatory cap that bars any U.S. bank from an acquisition that would give it more than 10% of the nation's total bank deposits.
Late last year, the big bank -- the only one close to the cap, with $584.3 billion, or 9%, of U.S. deposits -- sought and won shows of support for changing the federal policy in votes before the North Carolina Bankers Association and the New Hampshire Bankers Association. It has also approached bankers in Massachusetts and other states to support potential legislation this spring in Congress. Many lawmakers and community-bank advocates have previously opposed raising the cap.
A spokeswoman for Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said the bank's effort isn't a lobbying campaign but "part of an ongoing educational effort" about an important competitive issue.
U.S. banks are bound by the 10% cap, but Bank of America says it doesn't limit the ability of foreign-based banks -- some of which are among the nation's top deposit holders -- from merging with or acquiring U.S. banks.


He's Got Guts
We all complain, and with justice, about the falseness of much that is said in Washington, and the cowardice that leaves a great deal unsaid. But I found myself impressed and grateful for the words of Chuck Hagel, the Republican senator from Nebraska, in a meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. Because his message was not one Republicans or Democrats would find congenial, it may be accidentally dropped down the memory hole, so I'll quote at some length.
The committee was nearing a vote on what was, essentially, an announcement of no confidence in the administration's leadership in Iraq. Specifically it was a nonbinding resolution opposing the increase in troops the president has requested. This was not significant in a concrete way: The president has the power to send more troops, and they are already arriving. But as symbols go, it packed a punch. You couldn't watch it on television or on the Internet and not see that Mr. Hagel was letting it rip. He did not speak from notes or a text but while looking at his fellow senators. There seemed no time lag between thought and word. He was barreling, he was giving it to you straight, and he'd pick up the pieces later.
This is what he said: Congress has duties; in the case of the war, meeting those duties was not convenient; Congress did not meet them.
And so: "The Congress has stood in the shadow of this issue, Iraq, for four years. As [John] Warner noted..we have a constitutional responsibility as well as a moral responsibility to this country, to the young men and women we ask to go fight and die and their families. ..This is not a defeatist resolution, this is not a cut-and-run resolution, we're not talking about cutting off funds, not supporting the troops. This is a very real, responsible addressing of the most divisive issue in this country since Vietnam.
"Sure it's tough. Absolutely. And I think all 100 senators ought to be on the line on this. What do you believe? What are you willing to support? What do you think? Why are you elected? If you wanted a safe job, go sell shoes.


Paulson's Testimony on the Budget
Testimony of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson
before the House Ways and Means Committee
on the President's Fiscal Year 2008 Budget
Washington, D.C. -- Chairman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery, Members of the Committee:
I am pleased to be here today to provide an overview of the President's budget for fiscal year 2008. As the Secretary of the Treasury, my top priority is keeping America's economy strong for our workers, our families, and our businesses. And the President's budget supports that goal.
We start from a position of strength. Our economy appears to be transitioning from a period of above-trend growth to a more sustainable level of about three percent growth. More than 7.4 million jobs have been created since August 2003. Our unemployment rate is low at 4.6 percent. And over the last 12 months, real wages have increased 1.7 percent. Economic growth is finding its way into workers' paychecks as a result of low inflation. That means family budgets are going further.
Strong economic growth also benefits the government's fiscal position. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, budget receipts totaled $574 billion, an increase of 8 percent over the same period in fiscal year 2006. As a result of increased revenue over the last two years, we have brought the federal budget deficit down to 1.8 percent of GDP.


Paulson Asks Congress to Back Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson defended the White House's 2008 budget proposal, saying preserving the Bush administration's tax cuts would help ensure the U.S. economy remains strong.
Mr. Paulson, in prepared testimony delivered before the House Ways and Means Committee, said the U.S. economy has made the transition to a sustainable growth rate of around 3.0%, creating new jobs, higher wages and higher government revenues that have reduced the U.S. budget deficit as a share of the economy. (Read Mr. Paulson's prepared statement)
"The President has submitted a budget that reflects our strong economy and our nation's priorities: continued job creation and wage growth, improved energy security, and a strong fiscal position from which we can address long-term challenges such as strengthening Social Security and Medicare for future generations," Mr. Paulson said.
Mr. Paulson said tax cuts enacted during President George W. Bush first term had "helped our economy rebound from recession to its current robust health." Rising tax revenues from a growing economy, coupled with restrained spending should bring the federal budget into balance within five years, he added.
Many Democrats in Congress want to scale back some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which expire in 2010, and raise taxes on capital gains and higher-income people. Lawmakers from both parties say they want to permanently reform the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is ensnaring an ever-growing number of middle-class workers. Mr. Bush's budget provided for just a one-year AMT fix, estimated to cost $47 billion.


O'Keeffe Painting at Center of Modern Fight
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Two modernist masterpieces from the early 20th century sit in a storage chamber here at a downtown museum. They have been in this city for most of the last half century, but they've been out of view long enough that many residents may have forgotten about them.
Their owner, tiny Fisk University, has decided it's too expensive to continue insuring and caring for the paintings, by Georgia O'Keeffe and Marsden Hartley. Fisk wants to sell them both to help solve a financial crisis.
But a legal battle erupted over whether Fisk has the right to do that. Ms. O'Keeffe, who died in 1986 at the age of 98, gave the two paintings and many other artworks to Fisk in 1949, on the condition that they never be sold. This week, Tennessee Attorney General Robert E. Cooper Jr. stepped in to try to keep the paintings in Nashville. State law authorizes him to weigh in on the sale of charitable donations intended for public use.
The O'Keeffe painting, "Radiator Building -- Night, New York," and Mr. Hartley's "Painting No. 3" each were appraised at $8.5 million two years ago. The whole collection was valued at $33 million. That's more than the total endowment of Fisk, a historically black school and the alma mater of such luminaries as W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington and historian John Hope Franklin.

'Just Like in the Days of Vietnam'
As Congress's majority Democrats consider their next moves on Iraq, New York's senior senator is getting nostalgic, this report from the McClatchy-Tribune wire suggests:
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats would be "relentless."
"There will be resolution after resolution, amendment after amendment . . . just like in the days of Vietnam," Schumer said. "The pressure will mount, the president will find he has no strategy, he will have to change his strategy and the vast majority of our troops will be taken out of harm's way and come home."
Why would anyone want to replay "the days of Vietnam"? The outcome of that war was a defeat for America and a humanitarian disaster for the people of South Vietnam and Cambodia.
This column has long argued that antiwar ideologues, a group that includes a significant number of elected Democrats, viewed America's defeat in Vietnam as a victory for them--the enemy of my country is my friend and all that. But Schumer is no antiwar ideologue. He voted for the Iraq war. His eagerness for another Vietnam can be explained only as an act of political opportunism.
Yet here is where the Vietnam analogy really falls apart. It's hard to see any way in which Democrats benefited politically from becoming the anti-Vietnam party. In 1972 their antiwar nominee carried one state. They did well in 1974 and 1976, but more because of Watergate than Vietnam. And after the ineffectual leadership of Jimmy Carter, Democrats were not able to win the White House again until after the Soviet Union had disintegrated.
It is said that generals always fight the last war. Gen. Schumer is trying to fight this war using the same tactics that lost the last war for both the country and his party.


Italy's Prodi Set to Revive Government
ROME -- After resigning as Italy's prime minister last week, Romano Prodi is preparing to resurrect his government with his old cabinet intact and push ahead with his political program.
Keeping his slate of ministers in place could be a positive sign for completing some of the ambitious fiscal and economic goals Mr. Prodi has set.
After Mr. Prodi's administration came undone last week when it lost a Senate vote, President Giorgio Napolitano directed him to rebuild his parliamentary coalition -- which had commanded only a one-vote Senate majority.
Over the past few days, Mr. Prodi has lured a few new allies to his side in order to bolster his narrow majority in Parliament. He also forced the members of his coalition to sign off on a 12-point document aimed at guaranteeing greater cohesion within the group, which now numbers 10 parties ranging from Catholics to hard-core communists. Among Mr. Prodi's new supporters are the members of a small centrist party founded by a former ally of center-right opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi.
With a new coalition tentatively in place, Mr. Prodi must address Parliament this week before facing confidence votes in the upper and lower houses.


Bush Woes Rouse Democrats
WASHINGTON -- President Bush's problems running the government at home are hurting his efforts to contain Congress's say in directing the Iraq war overseas.
The House Appropriations Committee takes up a $124.1 billion wartime spending bill today, and the full Senate could vote as well on a resolution backed by Democrats to set a goal of withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by April 2008.
In both bills, Republicans and the White House say, Democrats are trying to "micromanage" the war. But in making this argument, Mr. Bush has been hit by a spate of embarrassments over his administration's management of the Walter Reed Army hospital, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department.
"Large operations, here or overseas, are not one of [the administration's] strong suits," said Sen. Thomas Carper (D., Del.).
Democrats have seized on the disclosures to make accountability and open government part of the war debate. In the run-up to the spending measure, the House devoted yesterday to four separate bills to expand public access to presidential records and to protect whistleblowers.


Gourmet Hash Browns
THE CHEF: Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, who spent time in the kitchens of Jamin in Paris and French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., before opening Frasca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colo., in 2004. He was named one of Food & Wine magazine's Best New Chefs for 2005 and was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Rising Star Chef award in 2006.
KNOWN FOR: Mr. Mackinnon-Patterson made his name interpreting one of Italy's lesser-known but up-and-coming regional cuisines, the foods of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, in northeast Italy. Lidia Bastianich is widely credited with introducing American palettes to this type of cooking when she opened Felidia in New York in 1981. The area draws on Slavic, Croatian, Slovenian and Austrian culinary traditions, with dishes like lamb stew and beef goulash -- not your typical Italian fare. Each summer, Mr. Mackinnon-Patterson and master sommelier Bobby Stuckey, the restaurant's co-owner and wine director, bring their staff of 30 to Friuli for a week of learning about the region's food and wine.
THE MEAL: Two courses of what would be a three-course meal in Friuli: frico -- "the greatest hash brown you've had," says Mr. Mackinnon-Patterson -- and pork scaloppini with diced hard-boiled eggs and horseradish. Serve the scaloppini with roasted chard. For the frico, "you really want to make sure your pan is very hot," he says, "or the frico will melt long before you achieve any color." For dessert, he suggests affogato, a shot of espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
KITCHEN TIP: "Always use the right knife for each task," Mr. Mackinnon-Patterson says. "Having a paring knife, chef's knife and a slicer will help prevent injury. I found out the hard way about eight years ago in France!"

Bush's Statement on Iraq War Anniversary
Text of President Bush's statement Monday on Iraq, as transcribed by CQ Transcriptions.
Good morning.
Four years ago today coalition forces launched Operation Iraqi Freedom to remove Saddam Hussein from power. They did so to eliminate the threat his regime posed to the Middle East and to the world.
Coalition forces carried out that mission with great courage and skill.
Today, the world is rid of Saddam Hussein. And a tyrant has been held to account -- for his crimes -- by his own people.


From the WSJ Opinion Archives
'Congress Is Standing Up to President Bush'
By a vote of 218-212, the House has approved a $124 billion supplemental spending bill to fund the military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill includes a promise that the U.S. will surrender in Iraq by Sept. 1, 2008.
This morning's New York Times explains that passage of the Democrat-backed measure was in doubt because some ultraliberal lawmakers objected to spending one more dollar supporting the troops:
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, used an array of persuasion techniques--some hard, some soft--as she walked through the House chamber on Thursday, seeking out undecided legislators in hopes of securing the 218 votes needed to pass the measure. Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a former civil rights leader and chief deputy whip, told Ms. Pelosi this week that he would oppose the bill because of his commitment to nonviolence and his unwillingness to devote more money to the war. "Let's pray about it," he recalled Ms. Pelosi saying. Ultimately, he added, "she respected my decision."
In the event, 14 Democrats--a mix of far-left types like Lewis, Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Maxine Waters of California and antisurrender moderates like Dan Boren of Oklahoma, Jim Marshall of Georgia and Gene Taylor of Mississippi--voted against the bill. Just two Republicans, Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland and Walter "Freedom Fries" Jones of North Carolina--voted "yes." California Democrat Fortney Hillman Stark Jr. voted "present."
That Times piece has a revealing explanation of Democratic motives:
In conversations with dozens of lawmakers in recent weeks, often in her Capitol suite or in a late-night telephone call, Ms. Pelosi argued aggressively for the bill, even as she empathized with their anguish over how to vote. But in the end, participants said, her argument often boiled down to this: Did they want a headline saying, "Congress is standing up to President Bush," or "Congress gives President Bush free rein?"
Mission accomplished, Nancy: See the top of this item. But this tells you all you need to know about Democratic "leadership" in Congress. It doesn't matter what's good for the country or whether America defeats its foreign enemies, only that the headlines make the Dems look tough on their domestic adversaries.


A Cure for Political Depression
I will never forget the stunning Oct. 7, 1962, Time magazine cover that showed Franklin D. Roosevelt weeping, a shining tear snaking its way down his pale and sunken cheek as he surveyed the destruction wrought by the New Frontier -- tax cuts, a Republican running Treasury. What an indictment of the Democratic Party; what a dirge for the New Deal.
Oh wait, that didn't happen.
Well, I do remember the great Time cover of JFK sobbing as he looked down on a cartoon of dope-smoking hippies holding a banner that said "McGovern." It was the summer of '72, and the little bubble over JFK's head said "Amnesty, Acid, Abortion . . . that's not A-OK!"
Oh wait, that didn't happen either.
Could I be correct that they only front-page weeping Republicans, and only laud conservatives when they're dead?


Sen. Leahy's Opening Remarks
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered this statement during a hearing on the firing of U.S. attorneys:
Today the Committee proceeds with another hearing into the mass replacements of U.S. attorneys. This morning we will hear testimony from D. Kyle Sampson, the former chief of staff to Attorney General Gonzales. He is represented by another attorney who served in the White House Counsel's office for this White House, Bradford Berenson. We thank Mr. Sampson for appearing voluntarily and testifying.
I hope that this hearing will provide us with an opportunity to learn additional facts and help us get beyond the shifting stories to the truth. Our goal is to get to the bottom of what happened, why it happened, and who was involved in devising and implementing this plan to replace so many United States attorneys across the country.
At his press conference two weeks ago -- and again this week in an interview -- Attorney General Gonzales seemed to heap much of the responsibility for this matter on Mr. Sampson. The "mistakes" the Attorney General admits were made seem, according to him, to have been made mostly by Mr. Sampson. He was one of the people in charge of assembling the list of U.S. attorneys to be fired. The Attorney General indicated he was also one of the people who concealed information from others at the Department of Justice so that there was, in the words of the Attorney General, "consequently information shared with the Congress that was incomplete."
This hearing gives Mr. Sampson a chance to answer these charges by the Attorney General and present the facts as he knows them. We ask only that Mr. Sampson share with us the truth and the whole truth with regard to these matters.


Help Your Kids -- While You're Still Here
There's no need to die first.
Planning to pass along money to your children? Sure, you could wait until your death. But there's a good argument for handing over some of your wealth a little earlier.
Here is a look at the benefits and pitfalls of enriching your kids while you are still alive -- and some thoughts on how to do it, should you decide to go ahead.
Making the Case
Yes, there are risks involved. If you give money to your kids when they're minors, it could hurt their chances of college financial aid. Even if they are in their 20s, they may not be mature enough to handle the money responsibly.
There is also the risk that half the money you give to your children could eventually be lost in a divorce. And, of course, there's the biggest risk of all: That you will give money to your children -- and then discover you need it for your own retirement.


Panel Ties CA Founder to Huge Fraud
A special committee of the board of directors has accused Charles Wang, founder and former chairman of Computer Associates International Inc., of directing and participating in fraudulent accounting during the 1980s and 1990s.
The committee's report, filed late Friday afternoon in Chancery Court in Delaware, is the first investigation that publicly ties Mr. Wang to what the government has described as a $2.2 billion accounting fraud. The committee recommended that the Islandia, N.Y., software company, which has changed its name to CA Inc., file suit to recover at least $500 million from Mr. Wang in costs related to his conduct, including a $225 million payment CA made to a government-ordered restitution fund.
The committee's findings are the latest twist in one of the major scandals to erupt amid the crackdown on accounting fraud after the technology bubble burst. The surprise October 2003 ouster of CA's longtime finance chief led to a frantic year in which Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar defended his leadership of the company, fought to save his job, was demoted and then forced out -- before ultimately being indicted for fraud.
Eight former CA officials have pleaded guilty to Justice Department charges related to CA's accounting. Mr. Wang, a 62-year-old Shanghai native and hard-driving entrepreneur who built the company into a Wall Street darling, hasn't been indicted.
In a strongly worded statement, Mr. Wang said he is "appalled" by the "fallacious" committee report, saying it is based on the statements of "those who perpetrated the crimes at issue and then lied about them." Mr. Wang said he felt "personally wronged" by Mr. Kumar -- his successor and onetime protégé -- and called his own decision in 1994 to recommend him for the position that would eventually take him to the corner office a "major mistake."


World Bank to Discuss Wolfowitz's Fate
WASHINGTON -- The World Bank's executive board is scheduled to meet late today to discuss the fate of Paul Wolfowitz, as the bank president sought to shore up support among top managers by suggesting he may shake up his inner circle.
At the center of the controversy is a pay-and-promotion package Mr. Wolfowitz prepared for his girlfriend, a bank employee. The pay package was part of an arrangement that detailed her to the State Department to avoid any conflict of interest. The executive board began looking two weeks ago into the case, which has brought to the surface long-festering concerns among bank staff over his leadership.
It isn't clear whether the 24-member board will take any final action at the closed-door session. The meeting, called by Eckhard Deutscher of Germany, the board's dean, comes five days after the institution's highest governing body signaled "great concern" with Mr. Wolfowitz's leadership and directed the executive board to review his actions.
Mr. Wolfowitz's session yesterday with senior managers included some sharp exchanges over the turmoil gripping the bank, officials said.
Notably, Graeme Wheeler, a New Zealander who is one of the bank's most senior managers, urged Mr. Wolfowitz to consider stepping down, officials said. Mr. Wheeler is one of two managing directors at the bank, putting him just below Mr. Wolfowitz on the organizational ladder. Mr. Wheeler was appointed to the position by Mr. Wolfowitz.


Making Sense of Senseless Acts
I had just finished reading "Underground," a book about the terrorist attacks in the Tokyo subway, when I heard the first dispatches from Virginia Tech. I might have fallen back on the age-old lamentation, "What is this world coming to?" except that I had just read the oral histories of people trying to make sense of a random assault that occurred more than a decade ago. So what I thought was, "Again."
On a sunny March morning in 1995, members of a religious cult called Aum Shinrikyo dropped plastic bags of poison gas -- sarin -- swaddled in newspapers on the floor of five Tokyo subway cars. The men punctured the pouches with sharpened umbrella tips and fled through the doors to getaway cars. Sarin is so lethal that breathing a pinhead's worth can be fatal. Almost all the victims -- 12 dead and thousands injured -- were ordinary workingmen and women hurrying to their jobs.
A few years later, Haruki Murakami, who has written several acclaimed novels including "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" and "Kafka on the Shore," was reading a magazine and happened upon a letter to the editor from a woman whose husband had been gassed. He survived, but could no longer work.
"The letter shocked me," Mr. Murakami wrote. He didn't know that so many survivors were permanently scarred. Mr. Murakami worried that their suffering would disappear into the ether. He decided to track down as many survivors, witnesses, doctors, cult members and families of the dead as he could. Then he tried to persuade them to recall, minute by minute, a day they badly wanted to forget.
Many people "slammed down the phone at the mere mention of publication," Mr. Murakami wrote. Of the 60 who eventually agreed to speak for the record, he said, "each had a face, a life, a family, hopes and fears, contradictions and dilemmas -- and all these factors had a place in the drama."


Israeli-Arab Tensions Renew War Fears
JERUSALEM -- As Israeli leaders defend themselves against a scathing report outlining government failings during last summer's Lebanon war, the chances of renewed conflict erupting this summer between Israel and its neighbors seem to be rising.
Heightened tensions on at least three fronts are shrinking room for miscalculation -- especially between Israel and Syria, analysts say. Most worry less about any side deliberately starting a war than a seemingly minor incident spiraling quickly into a confrontation and then out of control. Those concerns are especially high amid newly heated rhetoric, a diplomatic freeze and growing arsenals throughout the Middle East.
"Any mistake, any provocation, may lead to a war. We didn't see the situation this way even a year ago," says Eyal Zisser, a senior research fellow and Syrian specialist at Israel's Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies.
Some of this summer's potential flash points are familiar. Israeli intelligence and military officials continue to speak publicly about confronting Palestinian militants, who are believed to be amassing firepower and preparing defensive positions in the Gaza Strip. Such calls are likely to intensify following a decision by the militant group Hamas to fire an estimated 21 rockets and 68 mortar shells into Israel on its independence day last week, a clear violation of a five-month-old truce.
Across Israel's northern border, tensions with the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon have worsened, if anything. United Nations peacekeepers have forced Hezbollah to move farther back from the international boundary than its fighters were last summer, when some of them crossed into Israel and seized two Israeli soldiers. That sparked a war that left roughly 1,100 Lebanese and 160 Israelis dead.


A Reality Check for Newspapers
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
An association of Belgian newspaper publishers is at war with Google over the search-engine giant's linking to local newspapers' articles, as well as its practice of offering snippets of articles and small photographs in Google News.
Copiepresse wants its papers' articles to appear in Google search results. But it has objections to how Google does business. Among them, from various reports: Google should ask permission to link to pages, instead of relying on publishers to mark pages to not be indexed and to ask for pages to be removed; by linking to articles instead of newspaper front pages Google causes newspaper sites to miss out on money; Google's cache function can supplant papers' archives, costing them money; and while Google News doesn't feature ads, Google's main search pages do. (An email to Copiepresse wasn't returned.)
Copiepresse isn't alone in its objections: Google has battled Agence France Presse in a separate suit, since settled, and a group called the World Association of Newspapers has muttered about stopping "the exploitation of content" by search engines. And Copiepresse has threatened legal action against Yahoo and Microsoft . (And going back a decade, Ticketmaster made the same argument, to no avail.)
These disputes are about money, of course -- the newspaper groups think Google's making some off their efforts, and they want a piece. But more broadly, Copiepresse objects to the idea that Google and other search engines should set the rules for linking, contending that such standards should be set by copyright laws, not technological standards. That's a bid to turn back time and declare a do-over on the basics of search engines -- a quixotic effort that flies in the face of the reality of how content is consumed today, and one in which Copiepresse has inadvertently lined up against its papers' own readers.

Fed Transcripts Reveal 9/11 Thinking
The Federal Reserve faced one of its biggest challenges in 2001, confronting a sudden shock from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when the economy was already weakening. The Fed's immediate response helped ensure adequate liquidity for financial markets. Transcripts of its 2001 meetings, released Tuesday, show how the Fed sought to respond further by cutting interest rates within days of the attacks.
The first conference call by the Federal Open Market Committee, on Thursday, Sept. 13, 2001, revealed disagreement among Fed officials about the size of a rate cut. The committee had been expected to cut rates a quarter percentage point at its Oct. 2 meeting, but by Sept. 13, analysts were starting to predict a half-point cut. Here are excerpts from the Sept. 13 meeting.
Bill Poole, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: I think any beneficial effects that might come from reducing the federal funds rate target are going to be in terms of reassurance and the psychological aspects rather than that a reduction of a certain number of basis points will make an enormous direct contribution. .. If a step looks advisable, I certainly don't rule out a cut of 50 basis points, although from a reassurance point of view it seems to me that 25 basis points would perhaps be enough.
Bob Parry, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco: So it seems to me that many of the risks to economic growth that we talked about at our previous meetings have become, if anything, more visible and concrete. .. I would not favor a 25 basis point move. I think it would be appropriate to do something of a more substantive nature, certainly something that would at least be in accord with what seems to be reflected in the futures market.
Jack Guynn, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta: If we make a move, especially a large move of 50 basis points before the week is out, and the markets open and are really volatile on Monday, we may feel that we need to do more. And we may have fired all of our shots before we had to do so.


You Have Nothing to Fear but Fear of Us, Perhaps
I always have to chuckle when the Journal publishes a Letter to the Editor from a representative of an autocratic regime that expresses righteous indignation that his nation's "good reputation" is being sullied.
Such an epistle appeared on May 4, from M. A. Mohammadi, press counselor for the Mission of Iran to the United Nations. Mr. Mohammadi has the gall to state that "Iran has not attacked any of its neighbors," and indicates that the world has nothing to fear from his country. I seem to recall that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, and that its bombastic leader has pledged that he will wipe our ally, Israel, "off the map." If that isn't a danger to the world, I don't know what is.
Oren M. Spiegler
Upper Saint Clair, Pa.
Regardless of the true reason behind the U.S. move to install an anti-missile defense system in Eastern Europe, is the counselor to the U.N. Iranian Mission suggesting the world disregard President Ahmadinejad's repeated public threats to "wipe Israel off the map?" If not, how can he claim Iran poses no danger to "any of its neighbors?" If yes, one would expect he'd be out of a job.

Goldman Official Speaks on Derivatives
SEA ISLAND, GA. -- Wall Street needs to work harder, perhaps with a push from regulators, to agree on common procedures for settling credit derivatives with cash instead of delivery of underlying bonds, Goldman Sachs & Co. executive Gerald Corrigan said Wednesday.
Development of cash-based settlement protocols was one of the recommendations in 2005 of a private-sector task force on risk management led by Mr. Corrigan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"Significant progress has been made," Mr. Corrigan said at a conference on credit derivatives organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta here. But "even today we have not fully institutionalized that cash-settlement mechanism. The industry, with perhaps a little moral suasion from the official [regulatory] community, needs to finish that job. We need to do it sooner rather than later. That is an open issue."
Credit derivatives enable the buyer, in return for a premium linked to corporate bond rates, to obtain insurance in the event an underlying company defaults on its debt. Should such a default occur, the buyer and seller of the derivative can settle their transaction either by exchanging an actual bond or other IOU of the underlying company, or by paying cash. Credit derivative volumes are now so large that it is common for a shortage of the underlying bond to develop in the event of a default, causing problems in the settlement. Cash settlement would alleviate such problems.
Mr. Corrigan said there have been eight to 10 defaults in the past two years of companies whose debt was covered by credit derivatives, and while the industry "muscled through" those events, "The great imponderable is: Somewhere down the road, could there be a large-scale default or multiple defaults, which would make it even more difficult to muscle your way through?"


Senate, White House Near Immigration Deal
WASHINGTON -- The White House and Senate negotiators have narrowed their differences on immigration overhaul to a point where they hope to announce a final deal Thursday on legislation that can be brought to the Senate floor next week.
Commerce Secy. Carlos Gutierrez was in the Capitol Wednesday evening in an effort to resolve final details impacting agriculture workers. But the more decisive meeting came earlier in a second-floor corner office in the Senate Dirksen building where about a half-dozen key Democratic and Republican participants met with Mr. Gutierrez and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who has spearheaded the talks for the administration with Joel Kaplan, a top White House domestic policy adviser.
"Everybody in the room understood that tomorrow morning is the final time," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who has led the Democratic side. "Everyone realizes that if everyone in there wants to get a resolution of this in a positive way, it's all possible."
"Tonight's the night. We'll know by morning," Mr. Kennedy said. "If this thing goes over the weekend, it's finished."
The core bill, like the immigration overhaul effort that failed in the last Congress, promises millions of undocumented workers already in the U.S. a path to citizenship, something conservatives have criticized in the past as amnesty. But to pacify these complaints, the new measure offers a series of political tradeoffs that address other concerns on the right: chiefly border security and chain migration.


Standoff Risks Splintering Fragile Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The violent showdown raging between the Lebanese military and Sunni Muslim extremists has escalated into a major test of the government's ability to control the country and avert a wider conflict that could further destabilize the Middle East.
The Lebanese government faces an excruciating dilemma in the northern city of Tripoli, the scene of the fighting. Its troops have been unable to defeat the militants, who are well-armed and holed up in a Palestinian refugee camp off-limits to the Lebanese military. But the government risks being perceived as weak if it seeks to negotiate a cease-fire with the fighters, who have openly challenged the state's authority and killed dozens of Lebanese soldiers in the past three days.
That may leave the government torn between two politically risky options: raid the refugee camps or let the fighting drag on.
Since the assassination two years ago of Lebanese businessman and politician Rafik Hariri, Lebanon -- a tiny country of four million, split between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druse -- has been central to the Bush administration's attempts to establish democratic governments in the Middle East.
The Lebanese government, meanwhile, has been struggling to keep the country afloat and to preserve a fragile peace left in place last August by a cease-fire that ended the five-week war between Israel and Hezbollah militants. United Nations troops remain in southern Lebanon to provide a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah.


Kyl Hits Immigration Headwind
WASHINGTON -- Last year, in the midst of a heated re-election campaign, Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl hurled at his opponent a damaging accusation in the border state: He ran TV ads saying the Democrat supported "amnesty" for illegal immigrants.
Now, as Mr. Kyl backs a bipartisan Senate immigration bill, he is hearing the same charge leveled at him by other Republicans in his state and on conservative blogs and radio shows.
The debate between the conservative Mr. Kyl and his base is one of the most important battles determining the fate of the landmark immigration overhaul. Mr. Kyl hopes his endorsement will help win over other immigration hard-liners, a constituency where he has credibility, particularly after opposing last year's Senate-passed bill as too weak. That's the main reason the Bush administration pinpointed Mr. Kyl early on as a focal point of its legislative strategy.
Mr. Kyl yesterday won a victory in the Senate's first day considering amendments, as fellow lawmakers overwhelmingly defeated an attempt by some Democrats to strip out a temporary "guest worker" program that he backs.
But so far at least, Mr. Kyl appears to be having a hard time drawing the support of his fellow conservatives. And if he ultimately flees -- as he says he still may -- the entire effort is more likely to unravel.


Five Best
1. For Whom The Bell Tolls
By Ernest Hemingway
Scribner, 1940
Before I entered the U.S. Naval Academy as a young man, I'd read "For Whom the Bell Tolls," a book that helped bring home to me one of the fundamentals of military experience: what it is that moves soldiers in battle. Clashing ideologies and interests might be the genesis of war, but for the soldier any conflict comes down to fighting for his brothers. In Ernest Hemingway's novel, the main character, Robert Jordan, is an American teacher who has joined the International Brigades; he is an idealist battling against fascism in the Spanish Civil War. But he becomes disenchanted -- not necessarily with his cause but with its leaders and with their foreign allies. Still, in the end, Jordan voluntarily sacrifices his life for the sake of the people he fought alongside, the people he had come to love. Hemingway himself was not a veteran, but he saw war close up in the ambulance corps in World War I -- a perspective that gave him a profound grasp of the instinct that binds warriors together.
2. The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
By Edward Gibbon
1776-88
Edward Gibbon's six-volume classic is rightly considered the greatest historical narrative ever written. It chronicles Roman rule from the second century to the empire's collapse in the west in the fourth century and in the east in the 15th, with the fall of Constantinople. Gibbon famously portrayed the "vicissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man nor the proudest of his works, which buries empires and cities in a common grave." But his eloquent, sweeping exposition showed that this peerless imperial power had a hand in its own decay, done in by decadence, corruption and war. The soldiers of Rome's legions could not make up for the negligence of their leaders.
3. This Kind of War
By T.R. Fehrenbach
Macmillan, 1963


Russian Orthodox Unity -- the Real Story
Under the guise of questioning Russian President Vladimir Putin's domestic and foreign policies, Nadia Kizenko ("Church Merger, Putin's Acquisition," Houses of Worship, Taste page, Weekend Journal, May 25) seeks to discredit the church by misrepresenting the restoration of unity between the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) and the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Prof. Kizenko writes that "Aleksy II . . . gave short shrift to God, but thanked President Putin." Prof. Kizenko, who was not present at signing of the Act of Canonical Communion, nor at any of the subsequent ceremonies and services at which his holiness officiated, is unaware of the numerous times he publicly expressed his thanks to God. I can attest to this myself, having heard them in person. President Putin, in fact, was not mentioned nearly as often. Yet Prof. Kizenko herself credits the president: "[I]t was Mr. Putin who first made overtures to the Church Abroad in September 2003."
Yet Prof. Kizenko herself credits the president: "[I]t was Mr. Putin who first made overtures to the Church Abroad in September 2003."
No. It was in the early 1990s that the Moscow Patriarchate (including the patriarch himself) and the Council of Bishops of the Church Abroad first stated their desire to reconcile. This process gradually expanded and was only given extra impetus by President Putin some 10 years later.
Further, Prof. Kizenko writes: "Moscow regains . . . the right to open or close all parishes." This is false. The Act of Canonical Communion, which Ms. Kizenko would do well to read, clearly states that ROCOR is "independent in pastoral, educational, administrative, management, property, and civil matters."


Paycheck Protection Laws Slashed PAC Contributions
A May 25 Letter to the Editor ("State's 'Paycheck Protection' Law Is Flawed") accused the Journal's editorial page of grossly inflating the impact of paycheck protection laws. The statistics, provided by my foundation, were accurate. After Washington implemented its law, teacher contributions to the union's political action committee dropped by 85%. Utah adopted paycheck protection in 2001, and the teachers union PAC saw a 90% drop in voluntary contributions. The result is especially significant in Utah, a right-to-work state, where unions cannot require dues payment as a condition of employment.
Do union officials attempt to eviscerate and circumvent paycheck protection laws? Certainly. Fortunately, Washington's citizen-action statute allows for vigilant enforcement. Prosecution of the Washington Education Association for its violations resulted in the largest campaign finance penalties in state history. The law, now before the U.S. Supreme Court, is one method of reducing union coercion.
Paycheck protection, however, is not intended to artificially suppress union political spending, and any criticism of the policy for its failure to do so is misplaced. The goal is to ensure that every dollar the union spends on political activity is from a voluntary donor. As Thomas Jefferson wrote: "To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical."

Fed's Lacker Sees Second Half Rebound
FREDERICK, Md. -- Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said Wednesday that after a subpar first half, the U.S. economy is poised to rebound toward its noninflationary potential by the end of the year.
Core inflation, meanwhile, seems likely to hover around 2% unless there is a marked change in inflation expectations, Mr. Lacker added in prepared remarks that were similar to a speech he made on May 22.
"Without a prompt fall in inflation expectations, a reduction in inflation below 2% is likely to be temporary and hard to sustain," he said in his prepared remarks to a conference at Frederick Community College in Maryland. (Full text)
Mr. Lacker isn't a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year. Regional Fed chiefs vote on a rotating basis. Last year, Mr. Lacker dissented four times from Fed decisions to stand pat on rates, each time preferring a rate hike to quell price pressures.
But underlying inflationary pressures have retreated in recent months even without the rate hikes that Mr. Lacker would have preferred. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy -- has fallen from a 2.4% annual rate in February to just 2% in April, the slowest pace in more than a year and at the top end of the Fed's understood comfort zone.


Limited Legal Powers Hobble Tribal Nations
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
CHEROKEE, N.C. -- Jon Nathaniel Crowe, an American Indian, had a long-documented history of fighting with police officers and assaulting women. But the tribal court for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee, under whose jurisdiction he lives, couldn't sentence him to more than one year for any charge. Not when he left telephone messages threatening to kill an ex-girlfriend, not when he poured kerosene into his wife's mouth, not when he hit her with an ax handle.
"We put him away twice for a year, that's all we could do," says James Kilbourne, prosecutor for the tribe. "Then he got out and committed the same crime again."
Indian tribes are officially sovereign nations within the U.S., responsible for running services such as schools and courts. But a tangle of federal laws and judicial precedents has undermined much of their legal authority. As a result, seeking justice on Indian reservations is an uneven affair.
Tribes operate their own court systems, with their own judges and prosecutors. Sharply limited in their sentencing powers, they are permitted to mete out maximum jail time of only 12 months for any crime, no matter how severe. The law also forbids tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians, even those living on tribal land.


May Budget Deficit Rises From 2006
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. federal government ran a monthly budget deficit of $67.70 billion in May, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.
Treasury's monthly budget statement shows the May deficit was up 58% from a $42.91 billion deficit a year earlier. In April, the government had a $177.67 billion budget surplus, which was unrevised.
Outlays were $231.94 billion last month, down 2% from a year earlier. Government receipts in May were $164.24 billion, down 15% from a year earlier. The May deficit figure was smaller than the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of a $71 billion deficit during the month.
The Treasury estimates the U.S. government ran a budget deficit for the first eight months of fiscal 2007 -- October through May -- of $148.45 billion. That is down 35% from the fiscal year-to-date deficit a year earlier.
For the first eight months of fiscal 2007, receipts totaled a record $1.669 trillion, up 8% from the same period in fiscal 2006. Meanwhile, outlays so far totaled a record $1.817 trillion, up 3% from the same period a year ago.


Timeline of Events of Mosque Siege
2007
January: Scores of female seminary students armed with canes occupy a children's library in Islamabad, protesting government plans to demolish mosques and madrassas -- religious schools -- built without official permission.
March 27: In the start of a Taliban-style anti-vice campaign, female students abduct three women they accuse of running a brothel, then later seize two policemen. They are released after reportedly repenting.
April 6: The mosque sets up an Islamic Shariah court. The mosque's senior cleric, Maulana Abdul Aziz, vows to launch thousands of suicide attacks if the government tries to close him down.
April 9: The Shariah court hands down a religious edict, or fatwa, against Pakistan Tourism Minister Nilofar Bakhtiar, accusing her of committing a sin, after she is shown in newspaper photographs embracing a parachuting instructor following a charity jump in France.
April 10: The government blocks the mosque's Web site and radio station.


Private Equity Gives More to Republicans
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
WASHINGTON -- The leading Republican presidential candidates have received more campaign donations from private-equity firms than Democrats, a shift from past fund-raising patterns as Democrats view the industry as a source of new taxes.
Newly released campaign-finance reports show former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain received a total of $262,000 in contributions from employees of private-equity companies since January. The top Democrats in the 2008 race, Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York, Barack Obama of Illinois and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards received a total of $231,000, the reports show.
The numbers could be the first indication that private-equity managers are reversing their trend of giving most of their donations to Democrats. Since the 2000 election, the same private-equity firms were the source of an increasing share of their donations to Democrats, according to historical data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
To be sure, the new fund-raising analysis only includes donations to the six leading presidential candidates from the 11 private-equity companies that make up the Private Equity Council, an industry trade association. The data show that the three Republican candidates received 53.1% of the $493,000 donated to the leading candidates in both parties. The companies include industry leaders such as Carlyle Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Blackstone Group .


U.N. Tackles Africa's Air Safety
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
NAIROBI, Kenya -- Africa accounts for less than 5% of global air traffic, but about 25% of the world's plane crashes.
Flying is so dangerous that it even impaired the United Nations World Food Program's efforts to deliver aid to suffering populations around the continent. After a spate of crashes killed several WFP workers, the agency five years ago ordered a broad review of safety conditions on its flights.
Today, the WFP is delivering more than food in Africa's most troubled countries. By holding contractors to high standards on maintenance and flight operations, it is helping to avoid accidents at the small carriers it hires for humanitarian flights. The rigor WFP officials impose on their contractors is in turn feeding back to the national aviation regulators who oversee those operators. As a result, it is helping improve air safety across the continent.
"The WFP is lifting the bar for everyone," says Njuguna Mungai, director of operations at Kenyan commercial airline ALS Ltd. and a former official at the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority.


The Rise and Fall of Michael Vick
Looks like Michael Vick is going to jail.
The Atlanta Falcons quarterback has agreed to plead guilty to federal dogfighting charges, and will appear in court in Richmond, Va. on Monday. Recommended sentencing is 12 to 18 months in prison, though the judge in the case is free to impose a sentence above or below that range. (And can refuse to accept the agreement, which could still fall apart.) Mr. Vick will also face disciplinary action from the NFL, including the possibility of a lifetime ban. (For a primer on the case and the legal maneuverings, read Lester Munson on ESPN.com.)
In the Washington Post, Michael Wilbon wonders "if the people who unabashedly apologize for Michael Vick, particularly in and around Atlanta, will see Vick for what he is, for what he's been, or whether they'll continue to give him the kind of cover that allows his brand of arrogance to thrive. .. Like most people who are arrogant but not particularly smart, Vick overplayed his hand. To get back into pro football -- and there's no guarantee -- Vick is going to have to repeatedly and convincingly demonstrate a level of humility I doubt he's felt a single day in his life."
Mr. Wilbon ends by asking if arrogant high-school and college star athletes will draw any lesson about the perils of "keeping it real" -- a familiar subject for the Kansas City Star's Jason Whitlock.
"It's my belief that if Vick stayed involved with dogfighting, he did so primarily because it was a way to stay involved in an activity in which his 'boys' still participated," he writes. "It was Vick's way of keeping it real. He was fearful of being labeled a sellout, fearful of having his blackness questioned. This is a burden we've created for ourselves. We fight our own evolution. This must end. We need to redefine keeping it real. For athletes and other people who experience professional success, keeping it real should mean offering your lifelong friends and family members an opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to join the mainstream. .. Helping a friend or family member wallow in stupidity or self-destructive behavior is not keeping it real. It's enabling a problem, a problem that could eventually engulf you. Ask Michael Vick."


Jatropha Plant Gains Steam
HIRIYUR, India -- Until recently, B.K. Nagendrappa didn't care much at all about jatropha, an ugly wild green shrub that thrives in India. Now, the coconut grower hopes to plant as many as 12 acres of the stuff on his land near Bangalore.
V. Venkateswarao is also raising the plants -- on a dried-up stretch of dirt east of Hyderabad. So too is O.P. Singh, a horticulturist for India's Ministry of Railways, in a quiet garden by an old airport in New Delhi.
"This plant will save humanity, I tell you," Mr. Singh proclaims, as he points to 4-foot-tall jatropha shrubs nearby. Someday, "every house will have jatropha!"
With oil trading at roughly $70 a barrel, this lowly forest plant is suddenly an unlikely star on the world's alternative-energy stage.


Resignation Marks Turning Point
WASHINGTON -- The downfall of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was triggered by the Justice Department's firing of eight U.S. attorneys. But the brawl over his tenure turned on a far broader issue: the Bush administration's six-year effort to impose greater political control over the federal bureaucracy.
From his confirmation as attorney general in February 2005, Mr. Gonzales set about corralling his department's far-flung parts and 100,000 employees. In the civil-rights area, Mr. Gonzales promoted aides who sidelined career prosecutors deemed liberal-leaning in favor of political appointees. In corporate crime, new rules gave Washington greater oversight over prosecutors' daily activities. Antiterror operations were unified under a political appointee.
Each of the eight fired U.S. attorneys ran afoul, in one way or another, of loyalty tests set by Mr. Gonzales's chief of staff, a process that largely bypassed even the deputy attorney general. For seven months, members of Congress pilloried Mr. Gonzales as inept, accused him of lying and threatened him with impeachment for perjury.
It ended yesterday with Mr. Gonzales's resignation. President Bush said his friend received "unfair treatment" and "his good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons."
Mr. Gonzales's struggles reflect a deeper and still-simmering source of controversy for the administration. In fights ranging from executive privilege to global warming, the Bush administration has run into trouble as it tried to keep control within a tight and loyal coterie of executive-branch political appointees. Mr. Gonzales, a Bush confidante and former White House counsel, was dispatched to a department that has struggled, with mixed success, to maintain its independence.


Bush Announces Snow Retirement
The following is a transcript of President Bush announcing the resignation of Press Secretary Tony Snow on Aug. 31, and naming Dana Perino as his successor:
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Good afternoon to you.
Tony Snow informed me he's leaving. And I sadly accept his desire to leave the White House, and he'll do so on September the 14th. He is -- it's been a joy to watch him spar with you. He's smart, he's capable, he's witty. He's capable of -- he's able to talk about issues in a way that the American people can understand.
And I don't know what he's going to do -- I'm not sure he does yet, either. But whatever it is, it's going to be -- two things: One, he'll battle cancer and win. And secondly, he'll be a solid contributor to society.
I do want to thank Jill and Kendall, Robbie and Kristi. They have watched a man they love take on a big job, and at the same time, fight disease -- with a lot of courage. And so I accept, I love you, and I wish you all the best.


Brown Reaffirms Confidence in BOE's King
LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown Sunday reaffirmed his confidence in Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, despite the failure of a rescue package announced by the central bank to halt a run on Northern Rock PLC.
The United Kingdom's government was instead forced to guarantee deposits held at Northern Rock, a move that halted the run and also restored confidence in other U.K. banks.
Speaking to the BBC ahead of a speech to the Labour Party conference, Mr. Brown said both the BOE and King had played a key role in the economic stability of the past decade. "Mervyn King has been a brilliant governor of the Bank of England," Mr. Brown said.
The prime minister said Mr. King will continue in office at least until the end of his term in June of next year, although Mr. Brown didn't indicate whether he would be reappointed to a second term.
The run on Northern Rock is one of the most awkward economic policy issues that has faced the government since Labour came to power in 1997. It has focused attention on the high levels of personal debt in the U.K. and the role that borrowing has played in the strong growth the economy has experienced over the last decade.


'Citizen Journalists' Evade Myanmar's Blackout
As Myanmar's regime cracks down on a growing protest movement, "citizen journalists" are breaking the news to the world.
At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, a cellphone buzzed with news for Soe Myint, the editor in chief of Mizzima News, a publication about Myanmar run by exiles in New Delhi.
The message: "There is a tourist shot down" in Yangon, the center of recent protests by Buddhist monks and others against the military junta in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Troops there were clearing the streets, telling protesters they had just minutes to go home -- or be shot.
The text message wasn't from one of Soe Myint's reporters. In fact, he doesn't know who sent the message. He believes it came from one of the more than 100 students, activists and ordinary citizens who have been feeding him reports, images and video of the violent events unfolding in recent days.
In the age of YouTube, cellphone cameras and text messaging, technology is playing a critical role in helping news organizations and international groups follow Myanmar's biggest protests in nearly two decades. Citizen witnesses are using cellphones and the Internet to beam out images of bloodied monks and street fires, subverting the Myanmar government's effort to control media coverage and present a sanitized version of the uprising. The Associated Press reported yesterday that soldiers in Yangon fired automatic weapons into a crowd of demonstrators as tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters converged in the capital. Wire services have reported the number of dead at nine, citing the state media. (See related article.)


Iowa's Campus Kingmaker
Iowa City, Iowa
A hand-written thank-you from Bill Clinton and a private lunch with Sen. Joe Biden are becoming normal fare for college junior Atul Nakhasi.
"They're sucking up to me," the 19-year-old pre-med student said with a chuckle, "and I don't mind it."
The ambitious, energetic president of the University of Iowa Democrats has cleverly plotted to turn his once-moribund organization into a sought-after player in the Iowa caucuses, where the first delegates in the 2008 presidential campaign will be chosen. Today, Mr. Nakhasi will be on the stage when Barack Obama speaks to the campus.


Another Plea Expected in Milberg Case
In the federal prosecution of class-action law firm Milberg Weiss LLP, prosecutors appear poised to land another guilty plea.
Attorneys for Seymour Lazar, a former Milberg client accused of receiving illegal kickbacks, said at a status conference Monday in federal court in Los Angeles that Mr. Lazar had reached a plea agreement with the government. The plea agreement was not filed with the court.
Thomas Bienert, counsel to Mr. Lazar, did not return a call for comment.
A federal grand jury indicted Milberg and name partner Melvyn Weiss in an alleged scheme to pay millions in kickbacks to clients in exchange for their serving as name plaintiffs in class actions. Also charged was Mr. Lazar, who along with family members allegedly served as a plaintiff in Milberg cases from 1976 to about 2004.
Also, Paul Selzer, a former attorney for Mr. Lazar who was indicted for allegedly helping disguise payments to Mr. Lazar, is in plea discussions with the government, his lawyer said Monday. "Discussions are ongoing," David Weichert said in an interview. "Whether they bear fruit or not, we'll see."


Turkish 'Genocide' Bill Loses House Support
WASHINGTON -- Pressed by the White House and Turkish lobby, as many as 11 House members have withdrawn as co-sponsors of a resolution labeling the mass killings of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire a century ago as "genocide."
Seven members pulled their names from the measure Monday and four more as of Tuesday, leaving passage of the bill in doubt. The rapid erosion signals momentum has shifted in favor of Turkey and the Bush administration, which has urged the Democratic leadership to block a vote on the resolution, reported from the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week.
Though non-binding, the language has huge political importance to the Armenian-American community even as it has angered the Turkish government, which has mounted a strong lobbying campaign enlisting prominent veterans of Congress from both parties. Turkey recalled its ambassador to the U.S. last week after the committee vote, and as a NATO ally and vital supply route for on-going U.S. military operations in neighboring Iraq, Turkey commands strong allies among Democrats on prominent defense committees.
The Pentagon is preparing plans to send military supplies bound for U.S. forces in Iraq through other countries if Turkey carries through on threat to close its air space as part of a widening political dispute with the U.S. Such a move would pose major logistical challenges for the American military, which brings enormous quantities of food, fuel, ammunition, spare parts and vehicles into Iraq every month through the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) remains supportive nonetheless and has pledged to allow a vote this year. But if support continues to erode, she will have to reconsider what price to pay for what could be an embarrassing defeat.


Microsoft Drops All Appeals of EU Case
Microsoft Corp. said it has withdrawn the two remaining legal challenges to an EU antitrust order that it now says it will obey. The world's largest software maker yielded to European Union regulators on Monday, when it promised to obey key parts of a 2004 monopoly abuse ruling upheld by an appeals court last month. The software giant said it told the EU's appeals court on Wednesday that it was withdrawing an appeal against the 280.5 million euros ($357 million) fine that regulators imposed in July 2006 for not complying with an earlier demand that it share technical information with rivals. Microsoft said it paid the fine in October 2006. It also dropped a second appeal that asked the EU's Court of First Instance to annul the Commission's order that Microsoft license its intellectual property to open source systems such as Linux.

FDA OKs Novartis Leukemia Drug
The Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug from Novartis AG to treat patients with a form of leukemia who are resistant or intolerant to Gleevec, another drug considered standard treatment for the blood cancer, the company said Monday.
The agency approved Tasigna, an oral treatment for patients with a form of chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, who've failed treatment with other drugs, including Gleevec, which is also made by Novartis.
Gleevec is one of Novartis' biggest drugs, with global sales of $2.5 billion last year. Analysts say Tasigna will probably be a smaller but still significant drug; UBS forecasts it will ring up annual global sales of $1 billion by 2013.
Both are so-called targeted drugs, which home in on specific molecular signaling pathways that tell tumor cells to grow and proliferate. Gleevec has proved remarkably effective in most patients with CML, but some develop resistance to the drug or don't respond to it at all.
Tasigna will compete with a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. drug called Sprycel, which also treats CML patients who don't respond to Gleevec.


In Politics, a Voice of Authority Helps
Impressive biographies, fine policy positions. But do the candidates sound presidential?
Their vocal cords -- as much as the substance of their words -- could influence who becomes the next president, claim the people who study, measure, "focus-group" and coach the human voice.
"Voice matters -- it's what sells," says John Daly, a University of Texas communications professor who has written a book about persuasion. University of California at Los Angeles psychology professor Albert Mehrabian even claims to have quantified how important a voice is. When we are deciding whether we like the person delivering a message, tone of voice accounts for 38% of our opinion, body language for 55% and the actual words for just 7%, his studies suggest.
To gauge what the candidates' voices say about their appeal, The Wall Street Journal asked Washington voice coach Susan Miller of VoiceTrainer LLC to analyze the voices of seven Democrats and five Republicans by pitch, speed, and two measures of variability -- how loud and soft their voices are, and how high and low they go.
Ms. Miller also toted up the "ums" and "ahs" in two 20-second samples of each candidate's voice. The samples were taken from a May 7 Republican debate and a July 24 Democratic debate. The samples for former television actor and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson were taken from the Sept. 5 speech in which he announced his candidacy.


NTSB Seeks to Expand Air-Safety Measures
LOS ANGELES -- Transportation safety watchdogs, when they update their annual list of "most-wanted" improvements later this week, are likely to add recommendations aimed at preventing airliners from careening off runways during takeoffs or landings, according to people familiar with the details.
The National Transportation Safety Board is leaning toward expanding the "most wanted" list for aviation, these people said, by calling for stepped-up efforts against such runway excursions, or overruns. The board is expected to discuss expanding the current language on runway safety, which focuses on stopping runway incursions -- instances when two aircraft, or an aircraft and an airport vehicle, mistakenly end up simultaneously on the same runway.
At its meeting tomorrow in Washington, the safety board also is expected to consider a proposal to expand another of its top-10 aviation-safety categories, dealing with fatigue-related hazards. The board is mulling adding air-traffic controllers to its "most-wanted" recommendation calling for reducing "accidents and incidents caused by human fatigue." The current NTSB aviation-safety priorities call for revising working-hour limits for cockpit crews and mechanics, based on the latest research on fatigue and rest requirements.
A safety-board spokesman declined to comment on the "most-wanted" list before the five-member board votes on the issues.
The anticipated changes come in the wake of public debate over both issues, as well as a string of runway overrun accidents in recent years. Those crashes include a Southwest Airlines Co. jet that landed too fast and slid off a slushy runway at Midway Airport in Chicago in December 2005, and the crash of a TAM Linhas Aéreas SA jetliner that sped off the end of the strip in São Paulo, Brazil, in July, killing more than 180 people.

Vote for the Miserable Failure
Think you've got problems? Consider the perils of Susan Estrich. Divorced, she has to eke out a living as a lawyer to support her two children. The demands of that job mean she doesn't get to see the kids as often as she likes. She is overweight and lacks the discipline to exercise regularly. Her house is a mess, and unethical rug cleaners wrecked her living-room floor.
Wait, it gets worse. Her nanny lacks medical insurance because the application form is too confusing for Estrich to fill out. Estrich herself has health care, but complications from a recent surgical procedure have her feeling worse than ever. Her kids are ungrateful. And she doesn't even have a boyfriend!
"Most days," Estrich writes in a FoxNews.com column, "I feel like a failure at most of the things I try to do, and the only question is the matter of degree."
Clearly, she is presidential material.
Estrich isn't throwing her own hat into the ring, but the purpose of her column is to explain that she favors Hillary Clinton because Mrs. Clinton, like Estrich, falls well short of being a "superwoman":


Dispatches From Iraq
You hear the phrase "wait and see" a lot these days when it comes to Iraq. Is Iran honoring its pledge to try to stop support of militia groups in Iraq? "We'll have to wait and see." Is the security situation here sustainable? "We'll have to wait and see."
U.S. and Iraqi officials say the security situation is improving, but they always caution that the fight isn't over yet. They are just being pragmatic because they know how easily it could move backward. If anti-American Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr decides to end his cease fire or another mosque bombing ignites sectarian tension, for instance, the violence could easily flare up again.
U.S. military spokesman Rear Admiral Gregory Smith said about two weeks ago that based on recent weapons cache discoveries, it seemed like Iran was honoring its pledge to stop munitions from entering Iraq. But after a pet market bombing in Baghdad on Friday, Admiral Smith said on Saturday that the group responsible for that explosion had Iranian support. Today, Brigadier General James Yarbrough, head of the Iraqi Assistance Group, said he was taking a "wait and see attitude" to see if Iran was going to honor its pledge. "The willingness of Iran to stop the fighting helps but it's too early to tell," he said.
One of the first things you learn about Iraq is how quickly the situation changes. An Iraqi colleague of mine said he always laughs when he sees a Western commentator or Western analysis piece that predicts what will happen in Iraq. "I was born here and lived here for more than 20 years and I cannot predict what will happen tomorrow," he says with a big grin. "In Iraq, anything can happen."

U.S., Iraqi Officials Are in Airport Talks
NAJAF, Iraq -- Talks between U.S. and Najaf provincial officials Wednesday on a project to open an international airport in the holy city gave a glimpse of how business is done in Iraq. After several declarations praising the cooperation between Americans and Iraqis and a presentation on the $50 million airport project, the participants got down to business.
Michael McCormick, the transportation attache at the U.S. Embassy, told Najaf provincial officials that the most important aspect they had to consider was to ensure the airport was compliant with standards for safety and security set by the International Civilian Aviation Organization. And for that, it would be best for local officials to hire an aviation consultant. He provided the Iraqis with a list of companies that could provide those services.
Najaf officials repeatedly reassured the Americans that everything has been done to international standards, but they also asked the Americans to identify a consultant that could help them. Provincial officials said it was the Americans who had the expertise so they needed recommendations from the U.S. on which consultant to choose. It was symbolic of how much the Iraqis still rely on the Americans for help, even four years after the ouster of the Hussein regime.
"We suffer from a lack of expertise," said Najaf Deputy Gov. Abdul Hussein Abtan. "We need your guidance."
"If you give me one week, then I can give you an answer," Mr. McCormick replied, saying his office would put together a list of potential consultants.


It's Party Time for Mr. Scruggs
OXFORD, Miss. -- On Saturday night, a red-and-green bus built to look like a trolley car ferried guests from a parking lot near the University of Mississippi through a wrought-iron gate to a new white mansion on a wooded hilltop nearby.
Inside, one of the most-prominent trial lawyers in the country, Richard "Dickie" Scruggs, welcomed friends and acquaintances to a lavish Christmas party. As about 200 guests filed through the front door of the white-columned house, Mr. Scruggs and his wife, Diane, appeared unruffled by an event that had rocked their world days earlier: the super-lawyer's indictment for allegedly conspiring to bribe a Mississippi state-court judge, in a dispute over millions of dollars in legal fees from insurance settlements of Hurricane Katrina claims.
"The town really did turn out for them," said Robert Khayat, a longtime friend and the chancellor of the university.
Among Mr. Scruggs's many backers here is one of the most famous nonpracticing defense attorneys in the U.S. -- his friend John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were inspired in part by Mississippi's thriving lawyer subculture.
"This doesn't sound like the Dickie Scruggs that I know," Mr. Grisham said yesterday. "When you know Dickie, and how successful he has been, you could not believe he would be involved in such a boneheaded bribery scam that is not in the least bit sophisticated."


Prescription Abuse Seen in Nursing Homes
In recent years, Medicaid has spent more money on antipsychotic drugs for Americans than on any other class of pharmaceuticals -- including antibiotics, AIDS drugs or medicine to treat high-blood pressure.
One reason: Nursing homes across the U.S. are giving these drugs to elderly patients to quiet symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
Nearly 30% of the total nursing-home population is receiving antipsychotic drugs, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, known as CMS. In a practice known as "off label" use of prescription drugs, patients can get these powerful medicines whether they are psychotic or not. CMS says nearly 21% of nursing-home patients who don't have a psychosis diagnosis are on antipsychotic drugs.
That is what happened to a woman listed in New York state health department inspection records as Resident #18. The 84-year-old Alzheimer's patient, who lives at the Orchard Manor nursing home in Medina, N.Y., likes to wander and roll her wheelchair around her unit, according to a report filed earlier this year, and sometimes she nervously taps her foot.
To address her behavior, which was considered disruptive, Resident #18 was given a powerful antipsychotic drug called Seroquel, a drug approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Resident #18 is not psychotic and Seroquel -- like other atypical antipsychotics -- carries a "black box" warning that elderly dementia patients using it face a higher risk of death.


Northrop Seeks Air-Force Contract
Northrop Grumman Corp. will compete as the prime contractor for the Air Force's KC-10/KDC-10 aircraft program.
The nine-year contract, worth as much as $3.8 billion, covers logistics support for the KC-10 aircraft and global logistics, maintenance and repair support for the aerial refueling system for the KDC-10 aircraft.
Both aircraft are used for in-flight refueling and also can transport people and equipment. They can carry up to 75 people and nearly 170,000 pounds of cargo about 4,400 miles unrefueled.
The Air Force is planning an extensive advanced upgrade for the critical cockpit avionics of its aging KC-10 Extender tanker fleet, according to recently released Pentagon documents. The upgrades are designed to help keep the jets flying until the middle of the century.
The planes will be equipped with digital flight decks that enhance the aircraft's communications, navigation, surveillance and air-traffic management systems, according to an Aug. 30 pre-solicitation notice posted in Federal Business Opportunities.


New Wrinkle on Surveillance
WASHINGTON -- In the latest complication for the Bush administration's controversial surveillance activities, a key Democratic ally revealed what he said were secret Justice Department legal opinions that appear to undercut assurances from the government that it is protecting Americans' privacy.
The broad debate centers on a proposed update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the law that regulates the government's eavesdropping activities, which is currently being debated by Congress. The White House is fighting criticism that it wants to expand powers to eavesdrop on Americans.
Many Democrats and civil liberties groups have opposed sections of the proposed legislation, citing privacy concerns. The White House downplayed these fears, arguing that Americans are protected by a limitations put on the government in a 1981 Reagan administration executive order. The matter is set to be taken by the Senate next week.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), who has supported the FISA extension endorsed by the Bush administration, read Friday from the Senate floor what he said were notes from viewing the secret opinions. Sen. Whitehouse said he had succeeded in getting the administration to declassify sections of the opinions, which he said read, in part: "An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modified or waived it."
That suggests the 1981 executive order limiting the government's actions could be ignored by the president.


Schools Accused of Mainstreaming to Cut Costs
GREECE, N.Y -- For years, Jonathan Schuster's mother begged the public schools here to put her son in a special program where he could get extra help for his emotional problems. By 11th grade, Jonathan had broken his hand punching a wall and been hospitalized twice for depression -- once because he threatened to kill himself with a pocket knife.
But teachers insisted that Jonathan, who suffers from attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities and bipolar disorder, could get by in regular classrooms. His mother, Kathleen Lerch, says the reason was cost. "It was all about the bottom line," she says. Citing confidentiality, school officials declined to discuss Jonathan's case but said they seek to provide an appropriate education to all children.
Advocates for the disabled have long promoted the inclusion of special-education children in regular classes, a practice called mainstreaming. Many educators view mainstreaming as an antidote to the warehousing of children with special needs in separate, and often deficient, classrooms and buildings.
Now, some experts and parents complain that mainstreaming has increasingly taken on a new role in American education: a pretext for cost-cutting, hurting the children it was supposed to help. While studies show that mainstreaming can be beneficial for many students, critics say cash-hungry school districts are pushing the practice too hard, forcing many children into classes that can't meet their needs. Inclusion has evolved into "a way of downsizing special education," says Douglas Fuchs, a Vanderbilt University education professor.
Districts have a powerful motivation to cut special-education costs. U.S. schools spend almost twice as much on the average disabled student as they do on a nondisabled peer, according to a 2004 federal study. But the study also found that, in recent years, per-student special-education costs rose more slowly than for the general population. One of the likely reasons, researchers found, was cost savings from mainstreaming.


Telefonica Shakes Up Management
MADRID -- Telefonica SA Wednesday appointed Julio Linares as chief operating officer, filling its No. 2 position for the first time since 2003 as part of a wide-ranging management reshuffle.
Madrid-based Telefonica, also said in a statement that Antonio Viana-Baptista, head of the company's key Spanish division and formerly responsible for its mobile operations, will leave the firm.
The management shake-up comes as Telefonica faces tougher regulatory scrutiny from the European Union and as Spain's once booming economy is starting to show signs of fatigue. The company has released aggressive guidance for the coming years, and a slowdown in the Spanish economy would put in question these upbeat projections, analysts said.
The move could also be a good step for corporate governance, as it should create a better system of checks and balances, said Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Robert Grindle. "If [Messrs.] Alierta and Linares share some of the power at Telefonica, it could be very positive for the company," said Mr. Grindle, who rates the company at "hold." Mr. Linares has lately served as general manager for coordination, business development and synergies.
The last Telefonica chief operating officer was Fernando Abril-Martorell, who resigned in 2003 after a series of conflicts with Mr. Alierta.


Judge Tosses Short-Selling Fees Suit
NEW YORK -- A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an antitrust lawsuit filed last year against the securities industry's largest brokerage firms over certain fees charged in connection with short selling.
In an opinion Thursday, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan threw out the suit, saying in part that a "fine and complex line" exists between conduct permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its regulation of the securities industry and conduct that would typically not be permitted under federal antitrust laws, most notably certain daily communications between brokers-dealers to effectuate locating and borrowing securities for short sales.
"The threat of a "nonexpert jury" mistaking lawful conduct under the securities laws as evidence of a conspiracy under the antitrust laws and exacerbated by the prospect of trebled damages, would place immense pressure on defendants to curtail the open exchange of information," the judge said. "Such antitrust suits would likely chill a broad range of activities that the securities laws permit and encourage, and would likely inhibit the short selling activity that provides market liquidity and pricing efficiency."
The complaint, originally filed by Electronic Trading Group LLC in April 2006 and amended earlier this year, had alleged that the major broker-dealers charged unearned fees, commissions or interest on short sales where those broker-dealers failed to borrow or deliver the stock to back a short position.
The lawsuit, which had sought class-action status, also alleged that the broker-dealers conspired amongst themselves to fix the cost to borrow securities by setting a minimum borrowing rate well above what rates would have been had there not been a conspiracy.


The Best Friend of Bill
Your front-page article "Friends of Hillary" (Dec. 8) begins by saying that Hillary Clinton is "the ultimate professional woman." Sen. Clinton's professional career belies that sentence. Hillary has all this "experience" she's always talking about because of her husband's position. She got to the Rose Law Firm because of Bill's position; her years in Washington were the result of Bill's job; certainly her New York job was the result of being the president's wife. Maybe the other professional women you mention can see this obvious fact and aren't interested in supporting a woman who "arrived" on her husband's coattails.

Pfizer Officials in Nigeria Face Arrest
KANO, Nigeria -- A judge in Nigeria has ordered the arrest of three top officials of Pfizer Inc., saying they failed to honor an order to appear in court over a $2 billion suit the drug company is facing for a 1996 drug trial, court papers showed.
Judge Shehu Atikusaid said Monday the Pfizer unit officials in Nigeria haven't heeded a Nov. 6 ruling to appear in court. Those to be arrested are the head of Pfizer in Nigeria, Ngozi Edozien, and senior officials Lare Baale and Segun Donguro.
The trials for the antibiotic Trovan were conducted in Kano on 200 children during a meningitis epidemic in 1996. Nigeria alleges Pfizer conducted the trials illegally, without the full knowledge and consent of the government and the parents, causing the deaths of 11 children and injury to dozens of others.
A message left with Pfizer in New York wasn't returned.


Why It's Hard to Give Away a Kidney
Each year, hundreds of people decide they want to donate a kidney, not because someone they know needs a transplant, but because they want to help and don't care who benefits. But the desire to give can be hard to fulfill because many hospitals won't accept altruistic donors, and there are few resources to help donors navigate their options.
The hospitals' reluctance grows from concerns that these potential donors may be psychologically unstable, likely to change their minds and, perhaps, secretly paid for their kidneys. Given the risks of the surgery, which are small but real, some argue that it makes little sense for a stranger to donate a kidney.
"If someone really wants to help society, they can go work in a soup kitchen, they can join the Peace Corps, they can do a lot of things that don't put their lives at risk or implicate a [transplant] center," says Timothy Pruett, a kidney-transplant surgeon who is president of the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees transplantation under a government contract. His hospital, the University of Virginia, has handled just three of these donors, all in recent years.
Advocates of altruistic donation look at the UNOS transplant list -- where nearly 75,000 people are waiting for a kidney -- and argue that the nation needs every willing kidney it can get. Amid pressure to do more transplants, a few hospitals are starting to loosen their policies. A handful of online and other services have also sprung up that help match would-be donors with strangers in need.
But for the most part, such donors find that few hospitals are willing to take them. Garet Hill, a consultant from West Islip, N.Y., decided to help recruit altruistic donors after his 11-year-old daughter received a kidney from her cousin. He has created a matching service called the National Kidney Registry to help potential donors find a hospital that will take their kidney. Up and running for only about two months, the registry has received about 200 inquiries, most of them from people who said they were interested in donating anonymously to anyone who needs it. Of those, about 10 people have sent back follow-up paperwork so that Mr. Hill's group can make inquiries with hospitals.


How One Family Fought Foreclosure
BEACHWOOD, Ohio -- Faced with the threat of foreclosure, many homeowners give up and abandon their homes.
Then there's Richard Davet.
He and his wife, Lynn, lived in a six-bedroom home in this Cleveland suburb for nearly 20 years when, in 1996, he was served with a foreclosure lawsuit. Rather than turn over the keys, he hit the law books. Flooding the courts with papers, Mr. Davet staved off foreclosure for 11 years, until this past January, when a county sheriff's deputy evicted the couple and changed the locks. They didn't make a mortgage payment the entire time.
"Our four Scottish terriers are buried there," says the 63-year-old Mr. Davet. "It was heaven on earth, an unbelievable property, and they took it from us like candy from a baby."
Mr. Davet's case is believed to be the longest residential foreclosure of its kind in the history of Cuyahoga County, which is at the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis currently enveloping Ohio and many other parts of the country. Foreclosure actions are generally routine, typically taking from a few months to a couple of years to get the borrower out of the home. Companies turn the work over to so-called foreclosure-mill law firms, and generally cases are uncontested.


Books About the Cold War
1. The Twenty Years' Crisis: 1919-1939
By E.H. Carr
Macmillan, 1939
Published in 1939 just before Hitler invaded Poland, "The Twenty Years' Crisis: 1919-1939" was one of the first modern books on world politics in the classic tradition of Thucydides and Machiavelli. During the long weekend between the two world wars, says British scholar E.H. Carr (1892-1982), there was in the English-speaking world an almost "total neglect of the factor of power." Like Reinhold Niebuhr, whom he often quotes, Carr believes that a balance of power among states is the starting point in foreign policy but that morality is an essential consideration. Utopian "superstructures such as the League of Nations," he said, were not the answer. Carr's critics point to his early pro-Nazi stance and his muddled thinking about communist Russia. He once wrote that "the Russian Revolution gave me a sense of history" and it "turned me into a historian." That said, this book remains a seminal work on the realism that instructed U.S. and British Cold War statesmen.
2. Darkness at Noon
By Arthur Koestler
Macmillan, 1941
Born into a learned Jewish family in Budapest, Arthur Koestler (1905-83) was educated in pre-Nazi Germany. He became a Communist, served as a journalist in the Spanish Civil War and later visited the Soviet Union -- experiences that led him to conclude that both fascism and Marxism were evil political religions. Fluent in five languages, he wrote the novel "Darkness at Noon," one of the 20th century's most stirring anticommunist works, in English. He said that his characters in "Darkness at Noon" were fictitious but that "their actions are real," a composite of Stalin's "so-called Moscow Trials" and its victims, several of whom he knew personally. This intimacy with real victims enabled Koestler to make vivid the torture, brainwashing and forced confessions of uncommitted crimes. With consummate skill he underscored the vital moral issues of the Cold War, indeed of the human drama.
3. The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness
By Reinhold Niebuhr
Scribner, 1944


Opening Day
The first contest of the Presidential election season is finally upon us with Thursday's Iowa caucuses, and for our money it comes both too early and too late.
Iowa arrives too early this cycle in that it comes a full 10 months before the general election next November. We think the public was better served when the first primaries didn't begin until much later. In 1976, Ronald Reagan barely lost to President Ford in New Hampshire in February, but he was still able to make a contest of the nomination by winning the North Carolina primary in late March. That the Iowa home stretch is taking place this year when most families are preoccupied with the holidays is especially silly.
But Iowa comes late because the truncated nature of this primary season means the candidates have already been campaigning for more than a year. As Karl Rove wrote on these pages, both parties need to think about changing a nominating process that has turned into a two-year marathon yet could still yield nominees the public barely knows. There has to be a better way. Our own suggestion would be for primaries that began in the late spring and played out over three months, culminating in the nominating conventions close to Labor Day. Either that, or bring back the smoke-filled room.
This time we are nonetheless stuck with what we have, and at least Iowa will begin to cull the field. This year the state's caucuses seem especially important to the Democrats. Barack Obama and John Edwards need a victory to show they can challenge the Hillary Clinton juggernaut. Mr. Edwards has invested heavily in the state, and if his message of "two Americas" can't win amid the liberals who dominate Iowa's Democratic caucus-goers, it's not going to win anywhere.
With his recent rise in the polls, Mr. Obama has the new burden of higher expectations. Mrs. Clinton can afford to lose and fight on with her money and organization. As the upstart, Mr. Obama has to show he can put together enough of an organization to defeat her in Iowa and develop momentum to overtake Mrs. Clinton's lead in New Hampshire and beyond.


Come to Bethlehem and See Who Persecutes the Christians
In dismissing the necessity of Israel's security barrier to protect its citizens against attacks by Palestinian Muslim extremists, Kenneth L. Woodward ignores the pressures and ongoing intimidation facing Palestinian Christians by these same extremists ("The Plight of Bethlehem," op-ed, Dec. 24).
While Christians in Bethlehem do suffer daily hardships, their situation is not the result of Israel's desire for land. Rather, it is the fact that during the second Palestinian Intifada, Bethlehem served as a hotbed for Muslim extremists' hateful anti-Israel philosophy and a breeding ground for terrorism. To defend its citizens, Israel built a security barrier that has saved many lives by preventing suicide bombers from reaching their intended targets inside Israel.
Mr. Woodward claims that due to these necessary security measures, the Israelis have made it "impossible" for Christians to visit Christian holy sites in Bethlehem. Yet tourism was up by 50% this Christmas and the hotels reported a 100% occupancy rate, both indicating Israel's willingness to find ways to restore a sense of normalcy to the city. Additionally, Israel eased travel restrictions for Christians living in Gaza, allowing hundreds of pilgrims to celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem.
Additionally, Mr. Woodward fails to mention the intimidation and persecution Palestinian Christians endure from Palestinian Muslims. Incidents of Muslims stealing land from Christians, defacing their property and physically harassing them are well documented and have driven many Christians from the city. Indeed, since the Israeli pullout after the Oslo Accords, the situation for them has worsened, and the Christian population of Bethlehem, which had been about 80%, has been reduced to 15%.

Top Court Limits Shareholder Fraud Suits
WASHINGTON -- In the latest of a series of victories for Wall Street, the Supreme Court sharply limited the ability of shareholders defrauded by a company to sue other parties, including advisers, lawyers and accountants.
If the ruling had gone the other way, it could have expanded the power of defrauded shareholders to sue, invigorating the multibillion-dollar field of securities class-action lawsuits.
Instead, the court's opinion maintains a status quo and extends Wall Street's winning streak on securities cases. This is the fifth securities matter to come out in favor of business since 2004. Wall Street has successfully argued that Congress intended only the Securities and Exchange Commission to police fraud, not to open the door to lawsuits by private shareholders.
In particular, the ruling dims the hopes for shareholders in big accounting frauds, such as Enron Corp., where the perpetrator is bankrupt but firms that allegedly contributed to the fraud remain in business.


Participation in Vioxx settlement is strong after removal of issue
Prospects for Merck & Co.'s $4.85 billion Vioxx settlement grew more promising, with participation outpacing expectations and the parties agreeing on amendments that resolve a major sticking point and make payouts more attractive to holdout plaintiffs.
The parties announced Friday that more than 57,100 claimants out of an estimated 60,100 -- about 95% -- registered their cases by the Jan. 15 deadline, far more than the minimum required to keep the deal alive. "That's really remarkable in my view," said plaintiffs attorney Andy Birchfield, who was on the settlement-negotiating committee. Vioxx, a widely used painkiller, was pulled from the market in 2004 after being linked to cardiovascular problems. Under the settlement plan announced in November, Merck agreed to compensate plaintiffs who can show, under certain conditions, that taking the drug was connected with a heart attack or stroke.
At a status conference in federal court in New Orleans Friday, lawyers for Merck and the plaintiffs tied up some issues that had been a source of conflict. Groups of lawyers around the country had objected to a clause that required them to recommend the settlement either to all or none of their clients and to take steps to drop those who wished to opt out. Lawyers who contested that provision had filed motions citing ethical obligations to give clients individual counsel that isn't predicated on potential conflicts of interest.

General Dynamics' Net Jumps 42%
General Dynamics Corp.'s fourth-quarter net income jumped 42% as revenue gains outpaced cost increases. But the defense contractor projected 2008 earnings below analysts' expectations.
The maker of Abrams tanks and Stryker troop carriers, two mainstays of U.S. ground forces in Iraq, reported net income of $579 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $408 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a 13-cent loss from discontinued operations.
Revenue climbed 15% to $7.51 billion from $6.51 billion while operating costs rose 14% to $6.64 billion. The mean per-share earnings estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial was $1.41 on revenue of $7.54 billion.
Combat systems earnings soared 67% as sales jumped 47% amid strong vehicle sales. Operating earnings rose 20% at its marine-systems division, which makes submarines and warships.
General Dynamics' information systems and technology arm's, operating earnings fell 4.5%, while at its aerospace unit operating earnings increased 26.2%.


Duck Season
Bye-Ku for Dennis Kucinich
Surely he is an
Unidentified object
But he does not fly
(Previous bye-kus: Fred Thompson, Duncan Hunter, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden and Chris Dodd combined, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Tommy Thompson, Jim Gilmore.)
Duck Season
George W. Bush is a lame duck; he leaves office 361 days from today. Neither his vice president nor anyone who has served in his administration is seeking the presidency, so that a clean break is inevitable even if a Republican is elected in November. So how to explain this, reported by the Associated Press:
A liberal advocacy group plans to spend $8.5 million in a drive to ensure that President Bush's public approval doesn't improve as his days in the White House come to an end.
Americans United for Change plans to undertake a yearlong campaign, spending the bulk of the money on advertising, to keep public attention on what the group says are the Bush administration's failures, including the war in Iraq, the response to Hurricane Katrina and the current mortgage crisis.
In selling the plan to fundraisers, the group has argued that support for President Reagan was at a low of 42 percent in 1987 but climbed to 63 percent before he left office. "All of a sudden he became a rallying cry for conservatives and their ideology," said Brad Woodhouse, the group's president. "Progressives are still living with that."
Woodhouse is worried that President Bush's approval ratings will rise, à la Reagan, causing him to "become a rallying cry for conservatives"? That seems an unbelievably far-fetched scenario. The public seems to have soured on Bush around the fall of 2005, and his approval ratings have been so low since then that he would be lucky (if he cared about such things) to match Reagan's 42% nadir.
That 42%, according to the New York Times, came in March 1987, a few months after the revelation that the president had sold weapons to Iran's mullahs and several months before Oliver North's dramatic congressional testimony helped turn public opinion back in the administration's favor.


Open That Bottle Night: Sharing in the Celebration
We've heard from so many about your plans and we're eager to hear about your celebrations. We know that some of you are still on the fence, so here is one last push to get you to open that bottle. Two recent letters from readers who have already celebrated OTBN reminded us that now, on Feb. 23, is the time to toast friends, family, marriage or memories.
After OTBN, tell us about your evening. Send a note, photo or video to  or join a forum at wsj.com/OTBN. Be sure to include your name, city and phone number, in case we need to contact you so that we can share your account with other readers.
Warren Staudt, Jacksonville, Fla.:
"I jumped the gun on OTBN. My wife and I married in September 1957. On our 30th anniversary, we lived in Belgium. A friend scoured Paris wine shops and found a 30-year-old red Burgundy as a gift for us. We carefully stored it in our 'cave' awaiting a special occasion.
"In 1999, we moved to Florida, brought the bottle with us, and stored it in a refrigerated cabinet. My wife died in 2001 before we had found the 'special occasion.' This past September, on what would have been our 50th anniversary, I opened it at a local restaurant with my daughter and son-in-law. (The owner was so in awe of a 50-year-old bottle that he didn't charge corkage!)
"The cork fell apart. So we decanted the wine. The 1957 Volnay Premier Cru from Bouchard Père & Fils was quite drinkable even though 1957 was not known as a great year. Our friends' gift was greatly appreciated on this OTBN!"


Is Voter Turnout Really Reversing a Trend?
(See Corrections and Amplifications item below.)
Dozens of states have set records in voter turnout rates this primary season. Already, Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton each have received almost as many votes as the total number cast in the 2004 Democratic primaries. If this trend holds up in November, voters might beat the mark set in the 2004 general election.
That year, turnout was more than 60%, the highest rate reported since the 1968 presidential election, which boasted a slightly better figure. And that earlier number was helped by the fact that the voting age was 21, thereby eliminating the youngest of the eligibles, who tend to vote at lower rates than their elders.
By conventional wisdom, matching the 2004 turnout this November would mark a major reversal of a voting trend. Hosts of academic papers, books and political speeches have been written on the premise that the turnout rate has declined sharply since 1972. Curtis Gans, director of American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate, who has studied voting for 32 years, is a leading advocate of this theory. "Absolutely, there has been a long-term decline in turnout," he told me.
But today, a lively debate surrounds turnout figures. Michael McDonald, associate professor at George Mason University, argues that there has been no noticeable decline in overall turnout rates from 1972 to 2004. "Everyone fretting about turnout-rate declines are misplacing their worries, because a good chunk of it has to do with the way they're measuring turnout rates," he says.


Senate Moves to Ease Appointment Logjam
By undefined(See Corrections and Amplifications item below.)
WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed federal Judge Mark Filip as the Justice Department's No. 2 official, as part of a broader agreement with the White House that could loosen a logjam over appointments to dozens of vacant federal posts.
Democrats who control the Senate have held up the appointments, including Mr. Filip's, for months, unhappy over several White House moves -- and particularly the administration's failure to nominate more Democrats for panels like the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The agreement between Democrats and the White House to work more closely on appointments appears to be of limited scope. It doesn't directly address a major disagreement over presidential nominations to the Federal Reserve. Democrats have sought to prevent President Bush from filling more vacancies on its board of governors because terms last 14 years.
Still, the informal deal probably reduces the risk that several major agencies would cease to function at the highest levels. The SEC has been down to three members, and the Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign-finance laws, has fallen to just two. The SEC usually has five members. The Federal Election Commission has six seats.


Mexico Opposition Party May Dim Voice
Mexico's biggest left-wing party faces a leadership contest this Sunday that has turned into a referendum on whether the party will cling to its confrontational and radical past or whether it will modernize and help Mexico to break out of its drift.
The two main candidates to lead the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, are Jesús Ortega, who heads a bloc that calls itself the New Left, and Alejandro Encinas, a former Mexico City mayor and ally of former PRD presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
The result could help determine if Mexico can start to enjoy a less contentious democracy and help boost economic growth. Ever since the former ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party lost its grip on power in 2000, the country has endured legislative and ideological gridlock as three main parties fought for power and largely refused to cooperate with each other. As a result, the country has drifted further behind the dynamic economies of Asia and, increasingly, Latin America's other giant, Brazil.
The shadow of Mr. López Obrador hangs over Sunday's vote. In 2006, he narrowly lost the presidential race and refused to accept the results. He calls himself the "legitimate" president of Mexico and has urged the party to not recognize or collaborate with President Felipe Calderón of the conservative National Action Party.
Mr. Encinas, a former member of the defunct Mexican Communist Party, vows to stick with Mr. López Obrador and take a hard line against Mr. Calderón's government. If he wins, Mr. Encinas will likely throw the entire party machinery behind Mr. López Obrador for another run at the presidency in 2012.


Hu's Statements on Tibet
Hu Jintao, president of China and head of the Communist Party, was earlier in his career the party secretary in charge of the Tibet Autonomous Region. His Tibet post started in 1988 and a year later he imposed martial law there to suppress demonstrations. He took the helm of the party in 2002 and was appointed president the following year. Here are comments from Mr. Hu on Tibet over the years.
* * *
"The stability in Tibet concerns the stability of the country, and the safety in Tibet concerns the safety of the country." – Remarks made on March 6, 2008, just days before the riots, to the Tibet delegation in Beijing attending the National People's Congress.
* * *
"Differences between the Chinese government and the Dalai clique are not an ethnic issue, nor are they a religious or human rights issue. The differences are an issue of principle over whether or not one recognizes Tibet as an inseparable part of Chinese territory." – From Paris on Jan 27, 2004, Xinhua News Agency reported these remarks by President Hu during his visit there.
* * *
"The Han people and ethnic minorities are inseparable from each other, so are ethnic minorities themselves and that people of all ethnic groups should truly share weal and woe." -- Xinhua on Mr. Hu's speech at the 50th anniversary of the Communist Party's "peaceful liberation of Tibet" celebrations on July 19, 2001.
* * *
On May 22, 1991, Xinhua reported that Mr. Hu, who was then Tibet party chief, had co-authored an article in the Communist Party journal Seeking Truth, or Qiu Shi, about the party's Tibetan policy. He said Tibet wasn't only an economic issue, but also one about social stability and national prosperity. He would return to this theme many times in the ensuing years.


Political Diary
Barack Obama's speech on race relations played well in many circles and helped secure him the endorsement of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson last Friday. On Sunday, Mr. Obama was also endorsed by a lesser-known but more surprising figure -- a constitutional law professor who headed the Office of Legal Counsel for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
Doug Kmiec is a respected professor at Pepperdine Law School, where Ken Starr serves as dean. He certainly hasn't shown much previous inclination towards political apostasy -- earlier this month he was still serving as co-chair of the Mitt Romney campaign's Committee on the Courts and the Constitution.
Mr. Kmiec made his endorsement known in a blog posting on Slate.com so he clearly wasn't looking for too big a splash. But while he is unlikely to be joined by a posse of other Reaganites, his reasoning deserves some attention.
He begins by acknowledging that Mr. Obama holds views far more liberal than his on issues such as gay marriage and abortion. However, he apparently has embraced the "audacity of hope" in those areas: "I am convinced based upon his public pronouncements and his personal writing that on each of these questions he is not closed to understanding opposing points of view, and as best as it is humanly possible, he will respect and accommodate them."
Then he moves to the crux of his decision, which comes down to the Iraq War: "Our president has involved our nation in a military engagement without sufficient justification or clear objective. In so doing, he has incurred both tragic loss of life and extraordinary debt jeopardizing the economy and the well-being of the average American citizen."


Senate Shutdown
(See Correction & Amplification item below.)
It's not every day that a Member of the world's greatest deliberative body stops by to chat about his plans "to close the Senate down." Especially if his name is Arlen Specter. But the Pennsylvania Republican tells us he's concluded that this is the only way to prod Democrats to vote on, or even hold confirmation hearings on, President Bush's appeals-court nominees.
A look at the numbers explains why the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee is spitting mad. In the last two years of Bill Clinton's Administration, when Mr. Specter was in the chairman's seat, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 15 appellate court nominees. (See the nearby table.)
Now, more than halfway through Mr. Bush's final two years, Chairman Patrick Leahy isn't returning the Constitutional courtesy. The Democratic Senate has confirmed a mere six nominees with no plans in sight to move the remaining 11 forward. Judicial nominees rarely are confirmed in the final months of a President's second term, so the clock is running out. Democrats figure they'll retake the White House in November, and they don't mind leaving the courts short-handed for another year or two as they stall for liberal nominees.
Mr. Specter says he has recommended that Republicans "go full steam ahead" until Democrats agree to hold confirmation votes. He has in mind a series of procedural stalls that would make it next to impossible for the Senate to get anything done. These could include refusing to accept the usual unanimous consent motion to have the previous day's deliberations entered into the official record without a formal reading, a process that would take hours. So would reading the text of many bills, which can run to hundreds of pages.


Joe Shell, RIP
Joe Shell, RIP
California conservatives lost a political hero last Monday with the death of Joe Shell at age 89. The former University of Southern California football hero went on to a successful career in the oil industry and in 1952 was elected to the state assembly, where he rose to become GOP leader.
But the old gridiron star's finest hour came in 1962, when he decided that the Republican Party should not accept Richard Nixon's decision to move back west to run for California governor after his presidential loss to John F. Kennedy. "I never trusted Nixon either to be a conservative or to be honest," he once told me.
Despite tremendous pressure not to challenge Nixon in the GOP primary, Shell campaigned up and down the state warning the party faithful that Nixon was unreliable. In the end, Nixon won 65% of the primary vote but later acknowledged that his disagreements with conservatives during the primary contest with Shell cost him the November election. It was after that 1962 loss that Nixon told reporters: "You won't have Richard Nixon to kick around anymore."
While Nixon did bounce back later to become president, Shell never regretted his apostasy. "I felt then that Nixon was bad for the party and Watergate and the subsequent stain he left proved me right," he recalled.
Shell never again ran for public office, but played a crucial role in convincing George Deukmejian to run for governor in the 1980s, an office he won twice. Mr. Deukmejian then appointed his friend to the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, a post that Shell, good conservative that he was, soon resigned because he said the job was a sinecure that should be abolished.


In Defense of Isiah
At the New York Knicks' home finale Monday, fans couldn't even sustain the chants demanding change at the top – the irate sing-song of "Fire I-zay-ah" – that would echo for minutes on end through Madison Square Garden midway through the season. It was like they were too beaten down to try to will Isiah Thomas out the door anymore.
These fans don't just want change. They want closure. They want to erase all vestiges of what got their proud team to its current embarrassing state.
Who could blame them? I'd list all the Knicks' problems, but it's been done to death already. You're nobody in New York media circles if you haven't yet executed a 10,000-word takedown parsing What Went Wrong. And in most of these pieces, the dysfunctional, dispirited, paranoid, petty, crooked-shooting and allegedly sexual-harassing Knicks, with Mr. Thomas in charge, get what they deserve.
But in this country, everyone, even the worst among us, deserves a vigorous defense. A hostile fan base won't want to hear this, but a case could be made for the Knicks' keeping Isiah Thomas.
That's not to say they should let him keep coaching. Or keep him within a borough of the team checkbook. Or even let him in the building for games.


Campaign Notebook: How Obama Extended His Lead
Barack Obama's resounding victory in North Carolina, plus a solid showing in Indiana that left him just a few percentage points behind Hillary Clinton, followed a charm offensive designed to win the white working-class voters that had eluded him in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Sen. Obama took to the hardwood for a game of three-on-three basketball two weeks ago in Kokomo, Ind., with reporters and cameras in tow, a rare move for a campaign that had hesitated to allow footage of Obama playing basketball earlier in the campaign.
In Chapel Hill, N.C., the following week, he played basketball against the Final Four men's basketball squad at the University of North Carolina. "You guys are leaving the next president of the United States wide open," Head Coach Roy Williams jokingly scolded his squad.
In between hoops appearances, Sen. Obama courted the white working-class voters during retail stops at Indiana farms and senior centers, rolling rinks and manufacturing factories. The campaign dialed down the rah-rah rallies and offered voters the chance to see Sen. Obama up close.
His showing Tuesday came despite highly distracting publicity surrounding his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., who launched a media tour in which he repeated and defended racially inflammatory remarks that had already threatened to derail the senator's presidential campaign.


Don't Let It End
Dear Mrs. Clinton,
The Associated Press reported yesterday that you say you "will remain in the presidential race 'until there's a nominee.' " We were glad to hear it, but then we read the very next sentence: "The former first lady declined to say whether that meant through the roll call of the states at the Democratic National Convention this summer."
We hope you're just being coy, because so much is at stake here, and we hear lots of Democrats are urging you to call it quits. "George McGovern is switching his support for Hillary Clinton in this year's race for the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama, and he urged her to drop her bid so the party can unify behind one candidate," Bloomberg reports:
McGovern said the time has come for the two top Democrats to stop fighting each other and for the party to begin preparing for the general election battle against the likely Republican nominee, Arizona Senator John McCain.
"We've got to start getting ready for McCain," McGovern said in an interview. "This is a Democratic year unless we Democrats defeat ourselves."
Do you think George McGovern really has the best interests of the party at heart? Think about it. For 36 years he has been known as the guy who lost 49 states, and that's got to grate. For 24 years he has been known as the first guy who lost 49 states. George McGovern is 85 years old. He won't get many more chances to see someone lose 50 states.
The Associated Press, meanwhile, reports that other Democrats are not exactly profiles in courage:


Obama May Struggle to Draw Independents
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Barack Obama can't rest should he soon win Democrats' presidential-nomination marathon. His next big challenge: to introduce himself to the independents who may well decide the November election, and dispel the doubts and misinformation that have taken hold among many.
A focus group of independent voters here Monday night suggested that the Illinois senator is largely identified by his association with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., whose much-publicized sermons have been called racially divisive and anti-American. Yet Sen. Obama is also identified by many -- incorrectly -- as a Muslim, and suspect for that as well.
The upside for the Democrat is that the Republicans' likely nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, seems to hold less appeal among independents than he once did, thanks to an unpopular association of his own -- with President Bush.
In the fourth of 10 election-year focus groups sponsored by the nonpartisan Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a dozen Virginians were chosen to be representative of independents who don't participate in party primaries but will vote in November. The six men and six women ranged from 24 to 72 years old, and varied by income, profession, marital status, education and political leanings.
Democratic pollster Peter Hart conducts the sessions, which are open to reporters who remain behind a one-way window, invisible to the group. His chief impression: "While Barack Obama's supporters are shouting 'Yes, we can!', there is another group of independent voters who have not been part of the process who are asking 'Who are you?' "


Lockheed Wins Air Force Contract
Lockheed Martin Corp. won a $1.46 billion contract to provide the Air Force with its next-generation navigational satellites, defeating a rival bid from Boeing Co.
The program, known as Global Positioning System III, will have the satellites into service as soon as 2014. The first contract covers two satellites, but dozens more satellites are planned as part of the contract's three phases. They will be more powerful than the current version, be harder to jam, and have stronger signals in urban areas, important for both commercial and military uses.
"We will now focus on executing on our commitment by delivering this essential capability to our customer on schedule and on cost," Lockheed said in a statement. General Dynamics Corp. and ITT Corp. are part of Lockheed's team.
For the aerospace industry, the award is one of the last big military satellite contracts for the next few years.
The Bethesda, Md., company had been favored to win the work in the months leading up to today's announcement. The victory gives the company's satellite business a boost and steady government work for the next two decades.


Military Launches Alternate-Fuel Push
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. -- With fuel prices soaring, the U.S. military, the country's largest single consumer of oil, is turning into an alternative-fuels pioneer.
In March, Air Force Capt. Rick Fournier flew a B-1 stealth bomber code-named Dark 33 across this sprawling proving ground, to confirm for the first time that a plane could break the sound barrier using synthetic jet fuel. A similar formula -- a blend of half-synthetic and half-conventional petroleum -- has been used in some South African commercial airliners for years, but never in a jet going so fast.
"The hope is that the plane will be blind to the gas," Capt. Fournier said as he gripped the handle controlling the plane's thrusters during the test flight. "But you won't know unless you try."
With oil's multiyear ascent showing no signs of stopping -- crude futures set another record Tuesday, closing at $129.07 a barrel in New York trading -- energy security has emerged as a major concern for the Pentagon.


Trucking Regulators Warn on Use of Chantix
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued a warning Thursday on the anti-smoking drug Chantix, advising medical examiners "to not qualify anyone currently using this medication for commercial motor vehicle licenses."
The FMCSA oversees the interstate trucking and bus industry. Chantix, made by Pfizer , Inc., was attacked in a study by a non-profit group on Wednesday for possible links to seizures, dizziness, heart irregularity, diabetes and more than 100 accidents.
The Department of Transportation alerted its agencies about the study, asking the office directors be aware of the report's warnings and recommendations.
The Federal Aviation Administration banned the drug for pilots and air traffic controllers on Wednesday, hours after seeing the study, which reported that Chantix was linked to 988 serious events in the last quarter of 2007 alone.
The FDA did not announce any new action. Its spokeswoman said that the FDA was concentrating on potential links between Chantix and neuropsychiatric side effects. The FDA and Pfizer updated warnings on Chantix's label this year to include depression and suicidal thinking.


A Family Seeks Its Lost Son
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Tom and Betty West committed their mentally disabled son to a state institution. His name was Richard, and he was three years old. It was 1959. The massive complex was remote and family ties not encouraged. The state eventually moved Richard to a different facility without informing the Wests of the location. Four decades passed without a family member laying eyes on Richard.
As they entered their 80s, the Wests thought increasingly about Richard, the fifth of their eight children. How was he? Where did he live? Mr. West wanted to make sure that, following his death, some of his pension flowed to Richard.
State officials rejected Mr. West's request for information, calling Richard's whereabouts private. The Wests hired an attorney who ran into the same roadblocks. "At that point, I thought there is nothing more I could do," says Mr. West, a retired dam builder who is 87.
The Wests belong to a generation of parents who decades ago relinquished their disabled children, usually at the urging of physicians or other authorities. From the 1930s into the 1960s, tens of thousands of these children entered state facilities, which offered services that local communities lacked. Many never saw their families again.
"Fifty years ago, families were often advised to place their child in an institution, and basically told that, for the good of the child and family, to forget that the person existed," says Charlie Lakin, project director of the Research and Training Center on Community Living at the University of Minnesota.


Close Finish May Inspire Other Women
She isn't going to be commander in chief. But Hillary Clinton's close second-place finish in the Democratic Party primaries is likely to embolden other women to seek the highest jobs in politics, and it could help propel their advance.
Sen. Clinton drew her staunchest support from working-class and older women, who saw their struggle for equality mirrored in her hard-fought campaign. Young women and highly educated professional women sided more with Sen. Barack Obama, but on the whole women pushed Sen. Clinton over the top in her biggest victories. In California, she got 59% of the female vote, versus 45% of the male vote, and in Pennsylvania she got 59% of the female vote versus 49% of the male vote.
Her support among women is putting pressure on both Sen. Obama and Republican Party candidate Sen. John McCain to consider a female vice-presidential running mate. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have both been mentioned as possible running mates for Sen. McCain. Some of Sen. Clinton's backers are pushing for her to be Sen. Obama's running mate on the Democratic ticket.
Whether or not she is on the ballot, Sen. Clinton has made running for the presidency easier for future female White House aspirants. No woman has ever been so competitive.


Brave New World?
And so it begins, the campaign proper. You probably guessed that there would be no letup in this relentless year, no break between the primaries and the general election, that both candidates would stay on the screen. You were right. They will not leave, and go, and rest. They feel they can't, it's inch by inch, slow and steady wins the race. This robs them of the power of disappearance. You disappear and then come back and people say, "Hey, look at that guy." They listen anew after a break in the drone.
Not this time. And maybe never again.
For Barack Obama this week, a Beltway setback. He chose for a key position a D.C. insider who got fat working the system. This was a poor decision by the candidate of change. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss." But Jim Johnson was removed with dispatch, and the country didn't notice. Beltway bottom line: Mr. Obama the cool customer had a problem, removed the problem, has no problem.
John McCain had a worse time, with the famously awkward speech in front of the background whose color was variously compared to snot, puke and lime Jell-O. He was scored for not being adept with a teleprompter. The press knocked him, essentially, for not being smooth and manipulative enough. But if he were good at the teleprompter, they'd complain that he's too smooth and scripted.
The press will be nice to him again. When he's 17 points down.


Obama's Next Pivot?
"Faced with mounting pressure from voters to respond to record gasoline prices, some senior Democratic lawmakers Tuesday opened the door to a compromise with Republicans that would open more land on and offshore to oil and gas exploration and production," The Wall Street Journal reports:
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D., Ill.), said "I'm open to drilling and responsible production," adding that he and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, (D., Nev.), could support a modest expansion of offshore production.
Sen. Durbin said any compromise on drilling, however, would be contingent at a minimum on a requirement that oil and gas companies sitting on existing acreage either produce oil on those areas within a specified period or return the leases to the government.
What's behind this? Durbin is the senior senator from Illinois. The junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, has clinched the Democratic nomination for president. On Sunday Obama's Republican counterpart, John McCain, issued an ad (see video, read transcript) faulting Obama for, among other things, his opposition to offshore drilling:
Record gas prices. A climate in crisis. John McCain says solve it now with a balanced plan: Alternative energy, conservation, suspending the gas tax, and more production here at home. He's pushing his own party to face climate change. But Barack Obama? For conservation, but he just says no to lower gas taxes, no to nuclear, no to more production. No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.
Blogger TigerHawk notes the results of a new Pew Center survey, which shows a dramatic increase in the percentage of Americans who say expanding exploration and production is more important than conservation: from 35% in February (when gas was around $3 a gallon) to 47% in June. Support has risen especially among Obama constituencies: college graduates (up 17 points), Democrats (16 points), independents (19 points), liberals (23 points) and 18- to 29-year-olds (25 points).
Normally you'd expect high gas prices to help the party out of power. But Obama's opposition to increased energy production is a weakness McCain could easily exploit. Durbin's comment may be a signal that Obama will pivot soon.
Climbing the Walls
The New York Times Web site reports that the New York Times building has become something of an attractive nuisance:


Visions of Disheveled Angels
Cambridge, Mass.
In Chris Adrian's stories, children see their dead brothers in mirrors, use Ouija boards to commune with spirits and are visited by personal angels dressed in white lab coats.
Mr. Adrian's singular vision is shaped by a unique background. For the past several years, he's been studying for a master's in divinity at the Harvard Divinity School and working as an emergency-room doctor at Boston Children's Hospital.
"A Better Angel," Mr. Adrian's third book and his first short-story collection, comes out from Farrar, Straus, and Giroux on Aug. 5. His writing has been hailed as explosively imaginative, but the author himself presents an understated facade. When asked how he characterizes his work, Mr. Adrian, 37, chuckles and looks down at the ground. "I'd just say 'weird,'" he says.
Containing otherworldly elements and shot through with pain, Mr. Adrian's stories can be unsettling. He has come to be considered a "writer's writer" by his peers or, as the author puts it, "nobody's ever heard of me." He has a strong following among the literary magazine set, and with his latest book he has a chance to win a mainstream audience. "A Better Angel" stands to outperform its predecessors, as many of its stories have appeared in places like the New Yorker and the Paris Review, and at a little over 200 pages, it's eminently accessible. (Mr. Adrian's previous book, the novel "The Children's Hospital," was a hefty 615 pages long.)


From Red to Blue
From Red to Blue
In 2006, Colorado Democrat Bill Ritter captured his state's governorship with a hard-fought, pricey campaign. Two years earlier, New Hampshire Democrat John Lynch unseated incumbent Republican Craig Benson in a very tight race. Now, according to Congressional Quarterly, both states feature Senate races that "lean Democratic." That's a change from just a few weeks ago, when both Senate races seemed to be toss-ups.
As Democrats seek to build on their congressional gains from two years ago, one overlooked ingredient has been their success in gradually shaking off the "liberal" label thanks to strong governors or gubernatorial candidates who've helped redefine their state parties as more conservative than the party's national Democratic leadership. This is true in Colorado, where Rep. Mark Udall, is running strong in his bid for the Senate despite his opposition to increased drilling for oil and natural gas. And it's true in New Hampshire where former governor Jeanne Shaheen is putting the screws to incumbent Sen. John Sununu.
But it's also paying off in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell probably did more than any state official across the country to nail down congressional majorities for his party. Democrats picked up House seats in the suburbs of Philadelphia and a Senate seat in 2006 by picking off Republican Sen. Rick Santorum. That seat now represents the balance of power in the Senate. A similar dynamic is also paying off in Montana. Democrat Gov. Brian Schweitzer has helped redefine his party's image in the state, setting the stage for Jon Tester to knock off incumbent Republican Sen. Conrad Burns two years ago. It's also working in Ohio. Democrats didn't control much there in 2006. But they were able to win both the governor's mansion and a Senate seat thanks to Republican scandals and strong campaigns by Ted Strickland and Sherrod Brown.
In presidential politics, governors can't always deliver their states for their party's candidate. Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina are three states where Democrats have held governorships in recent years while Republicans won solid presidential victories. Another state that comes to mind is West Virginia, where George W. Bush prevailed in 2004 even as Democrats held onto the governor's mansion in electing Joe Manchin. But if Republicans want to find their way out of the congressional wilderness and start picking up seats in the House and Senate, they might want try winning a few governor's races in competitive states.

McCain Raised $27 Million in July
John McCain raised $27 million in July, according to his campaign manager, the Republican presidential candidate's highest monthly total to date and the fifth consecutive month-over-month increase.
The Arizona senator still lags behind his Democratic rival, Barack Obama, who raised $52 million in June, according to Federal Election Commission reports. The Obama campaign, which hasn't released its July haul, declined to comment.
The McCain campaign also was quick to boast about the Republican National Committee, which raised just under $26 million in July and ended the month with more than $75 million cash on hand, said McCain campaign manager Rick Davis. "We have a formidable financial structure," Mr. Davis said Friday, adding that Sen. McCain has received money from almost 600,000 individual donors, and the RNC has surpassed one million contributors.
At the end of July, the McCain campaign had $21.4 million in cash on hand.
A wave of spending, mostly on television ads, is expected before Sen. McCain accepts the nomination at the Republican convention in early September; to comply with federal public-financing rules, the July money -- and the rest of his primary funds -- can't be spent after the official start of the general election.


Kerkorian Testifies in Wiretapping Case
(See Corrections and Amplifications item below.)
LOS ANGELES -- Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian testified in federal court Wednesday that he didn't know that an investigator accused of illegal wiretapping, Anthony Pellicano, was working for Mr. Kerkorian's own lawyer.
Mr. Kerkorian took the witness stand for about a half hour in a trial over whether his longtime lawyer, Terry Christensen, hired Mr. Pellicano to wiretap Mr. Kerkorian's ex-wife. Mr. Christensen, who argues he had no knowledge of the wiretaps, and Mr. Pellicano each face two felony counts of wiretapping and conspiracy.
Mr. Pellicano's legal troubles have attracted interest because his work as private investigator brought him into contact with many high-profile Hollywood figures.
Patricia Glaser, who is representing Mr. Christensen and is a partner in his law firm, sought to establish that Mr. Kerkorian wasn't aware of Mr. Pellicano's role. When asked about an April 2002 meeting where Mr. Kerkorian said he first met Mr. Pellicano, Mr. Kerkorian responded that he didn't know whom Mr. Pellicano represented.


Clinton Tries to Rally Supporters
DENVER -- With many of her enthusiastic backers still lukewarm on Barack Obama, New York Senator Hillary Clinton called on Democrats to unite around their presumptive presidential nominee.
"I ask each and every one of you to work as hard for Barack Obama and Joe Biden as you worked for me," Sen. Clinton told the New York delegation at a breakfast hours before the Democratic convention was to formally open in Denver. "We are united, we are together and we are determined."
Sen. Clinton received a lengthy standing ovation from rapturous delegates, many of whom sported Hillary pins and hats and waved signs reading "Hillary Made History."
Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, in a pair of new TV ads, has seized on Obama's running-mate pick in an effort to woo some of the 18 million voters who backed Sen. Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Polls show Clinton supporters still aren't sold on Sen. Obama. Just 52% of Clinton voters plan to vote for Obama, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
Sen. Clinton disavowed the McCain ads.


Charges Filed Against Quest Resource Ex-CEO
Oklahoma regulators Friday filed civil fraud charges against Jerry Cash, the former chairman and chief executive of natural-gas producer Quest Resource Corp.
According to a civil suit filed by the Oklahoma Department of Securities, Mr. Cash repeatedly transferred funds from Quest and at least one of its affiliates to Rockport Energy LLC, a Texas business he controlled. According to a press release put out by the regulator, the funds "were then used by Mr. Cash for his personal benefit."
Mr. Cash resigned from Quest Monday following what the company said was the discovery of "questionable transfers of company funds" totaling about $10 million.
Quest's chief financial officer, David Grose, was placed on paid leave Monday during the investigation but has not been charged. Quest Chief Operating Officer David Lawler has been named president and is now running the company.
According to regulators, Mr. Cash agreed to have his assets frozen temporarily, but has not admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Cash's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. Quest Resource also could not immediately be reached.


Cheney Condemns Russia's Actions
TBILISI, Georgia -- In a high-profile visit to war-torn Georgia, Vice President Dick Cheney sought to reassure nervous Georgians of international support without rattling European allies who worry about pushing back too hard against Russia.
At a joint appearance with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Mr. Cheney -- citing a new White House pledge of $1 billion in civilian aid -- said, "America will help Georgia rebuild and regain its position as one of the world's fastest-growing economies."
The vice president also promised continued international support to help Georgia maintain its freedom. "It is the responsibility of the free world to rally to the side of Georgia," Mr Cheney said. "We will help your people to heal this nation's wounds..and to ensure Georgia's democracy, independence and further integration with the West."
After lunch with Mr. Saakashvili, Mr. Cheney toured a U.S. C-17 military cargo plane at Tbilisi's military airport. The plane was hauling humanitarian supplies for war refugees, a small show of American force in the face of the continued Russian threat. Within sight of the C-17 and its camouflaged command post was an aircraft factory that a U.S. Embassy official said had been bombed twice by Russian aircraft.
An important aim of Thursday's stopover and of Mr. Cheney's visits to nearby Azerbaijan and Ukraine this week was to underscore, in light of Russia's newfound assertiveness, the continued U.S. commitment to protecting the young nations that have emerged from the ashes of the old Soviet Union.


Thais Want to Vote
BANGKOK
Thailand's democracy looks like it is teetering on the brink of collapse. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej was indicted last week on charges that he violated the constitution, and has stepped down. The People's Alliance for Democracy, a protest group, has vowed to occupy Government House lawns until the elected government is toppled. The army is standing aside as law and order deteriorates. Yet as ominous as these events are, history shows that Thailand is still on a slow, but steady, path to full democracy.
Since becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1932, Thailand has had 18 constitutions, 22 elections and 21 military coup attempts, of which 14 succeeded. It wasn't until the 1970s that Bangkokians demanded an end to military rule. While that resulted in the bloody 1976 student crackdown, it also paved the way for "managed democracy," where the military and Bangkok elites shared power. Each political transition has brought with it a wider dispersion of power. Over seven decades, Thailand has moved from absolute monarchy, to a power-sharing arrangement with the military, to limited democracy with the enfranchisement of the Bangkok middle class and recently, of Thailand's rural voters.
Without doubt the current conflict is serious, but such upheavals have punctuated extended periods of political "equilibrium" and peace that allowed for substantial economic development. As Thailand grew richer, more groups of people demanded a greater say in shaping their government. For example, until 1973 the military dominated Thai politics. In the 1980s power was shared with the Bangkok elite. In 1992, those elites revolted against a threat of military re-domination of Thai politics and demanded full democracy. While blood was spilled on the streets, it paved the way for the 1997 constitution, which significantly strengthened the legislative and executive branches and expanded Thai democracy by devolving political and taxation power to rural communities.
This decentralization of power gave rural communities greater say in Thailand's national politics. Thai scholar Nidhi Eoseewong argues that the rural lower middle class is now the largest segment of Thai society. Other studies have confirmed that the rural population and informal urban sector constitute two-thirds of the Thai population. The sons and daughters of farmers are better educated and have benefited from the commercialization and growth of the rural sector. They want access to credit, health care and education, and harbor middle-class aspirations.


The Sun Rises In the West For Democrats
The Northeast is for Democrats and the South is for Republicans -- that's been a reliable rule of thumb. Meanwhile, the real battleground today is the Inner Mountain West -- and after a decade of Republican gains in the 1990s, Democrats are once again on the rise.
It's no accident Democrats chose to hold their convention in Denver. From House seats to Senate seats and even Electoral College votes, the party sees the region as ripe for the picking, thanks to the GOP's tarnished image and a new openness on issues traditionally of concern to Western voters.
As often happens, the first signs of Democratic resurgence came as the party captured governor's races. In 2000, Republicans held governors' mansions in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and Montana. Democrats now control all five offices.
Senate seats have been slower in turning over, but moderate Democrats Ken Salazar and Jon Tester won Republican-held seats in the past two cycles in Colorado and Montana. This year, Democrats are likely to capture the New Mexico seat of retiring Republican Pete Domenici; a Democratic poll released Wednesday shows Rep. Tom Udall leading Republican Rep. Steve Pearce by sixteen points. Mr. Udall's cousin Mark, a Democratic congressman, also leads in his own race against Republican Bob Schaffer for the Colorado seat of retiring Senator Wayne Allard, though by a narrower margin.
But the biggest winner this year could be the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has the chance to pick up as many as ten seats in Mountain West states. The party is spending money in support of strong candidates in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and even Idaho, ordinarily one of the most reliably Republican states in the country.


Undecideds Think It Over
BOARDMAN, Ohio -- Joe Sullivan worked his way through a cheese pizza during Friday's presidential debate, and as the candidates argued over the idea of face-to-face talks with rogue states, he couldn't help but think of his own divorce two years ago.
"It's always better to communicate," said Mr. Sullivan, who is 55 years old. "It's the most important thing you can do; countries, people, doesn't matter."
With much of the country clumped into red or blue states, the votes of working-class white suburbanites like Mr. Sullivan in such swing states as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania could decide this year's election. Ohio, with its 20 electoral votes, is evenly split in the polls between Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain.
Sen. Obama can count on strong support from big cities. Sen. McCain is polling well in rural communities and more-distant suburbs. As many as 24% of voters in the state say they are undecided or could change their mind before the Nov. 4 election, according to a poll by the Ohio News Organization, a consortium of eight newspapers.


A Main Street Rescue
The $700 billion financial rescue that Congress votes on today must surely rank as the least popular legislation in modern times. Most Members want it to pass, though not with their vote after it has been trashed so relentlessly in the press as a Wall Street "bailout." And yet it deserves to pass because in reality it is an attempt to shield middle America from further harm caused by the mistakes of Wall Street and Washington.
For 13 months, the U.S. economy has held up remarkably well despite the implosion in financial markets. But that has recently changed, as market strains have become a global panic that threatens to trigger a deep recession and perhaps a crash. It is hard to sell voters on insurance against damage that hasn't occurred. (See Fannie Mae, 30-year history of.) But as Michael Darda argues, the current seizure in the credit markets is real and will do far more harm if not repaired soon. The weekend runs on Fortis in Europe and Wachovia in the U.S. should concentrate Congressional minds about what could happen if the bill fails.
Today's vote is essentially a pledge of public capital to defend and rebuild the financial system. Some of that capital has already been committed via the Federal Reserve, albeit with politicians preferring not to notice. With this vote, Congress is at last taking some ownership for the mess its policies helped to create by fueling the credit housing mania earlier this decade.
Congress long ago committed taxpayers when it let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac run wild risks with a public subsidy. It's a little rich to see some of Fannie's most devoted GOP patrons now invoking "free-market" principles to oppose cleaning up their mess. More than one Republican opponent also seems to be angling for a leadership challenge next year, even at the risk of causing a bigger GOP defeat if the bill fails.
We agree with those who say there are better ways to provide this public capital, but Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's plan should do some good, and if executed properly shouldn't cost taxpayers anything close to its $700 billion showroom price.


Paulson's Stature Takes a Beating
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson spent two years building relations on Capitol Hill. Many of them came crashing down this past week.
Amid the tumult sparked by the administration's $700 billion economic-rescue package that cleared Congress Friday, an increasing number of lawmakers are questioning Mr. Paulson's handling of the situation, criticizing the bare-bones request he initially sent to Congress and the way he struggled to make the proposal palatable to Main Street.
Their frustration complicated Mr. Paulson's efforts to win the legislation he wanted and forced him to agree to provisions he originally opposed.
It is a striking turnabout for Mr. Paulson, who worked hard to build good relations with Congress and had a relatively free hand as the administration's point man on the financial emergency. Indeed, Republican presidential nominee John McCain had suggested he might ask Mr. Paulson to stick around if the Arizona senator wins the election.
Now, instead of the "clean" bill Mr. Paulson and President George W. Bush initially requested -- which essentially provided a $700 billion check that gave Treasury broad authority -- Congress passed a 400-plus-page package loaded with sweeteners. Lawmakers threw in tax credits, executive-pay limits and even a tax exemption for the producers of wooden arrows, and did so only after two weeks of contentious argument and high drama.


Just Asking: Doris Lessing
Born in Persia, raised on a farm in southern Rhodesia and a long-time resident of London, Doris Lessing, 88 years old, has led an unconventional and peripatetic life. But over the decades, she has maintained several passionate, long-term relationships -- with cats. She has rescued, harbored and adored them, and when necessary to save the life of a mother cat, she has condemned some kittens to death. Ms. Lessing, who won the Nobel Prize for literature last year, is best known for her novels, including the 1962 feminist classic, "The Golden Notebook," and the Canopus in Argos science-fiction series. But in her book, "On Cats" (first published in England in 2002, just out in the U.S.), Ms. Lessing applies her formidable powers of observation to the beasts she calls "exotic visitors, household friends."
WSJ:Do you have cats now?
Ms. Lessing: I have a very difficult cat named Yum-Yum. Her previous owner treated her badly and dumped her. When she turned up here she was five years old. She was enormously scared and spent most of a year under my sofa. It took a long time for her to be a reasonably normal cat. Most cats are warm and kind, on the whole. Yum-Yum had none of that.
I'm guessing none of your cats has ever had a diamond-studded collar.
No! I've never had a posh cat. But one of the cats that was born here, El Magnifico, never understood that there were cats less privileged than him.


McCain to Launch Fresh Attack on Obama's Tax Plan
Looking for fresh ways to press the tax issue, John McCain plans to roll out a new attack against Barack Obama on Friday, claiming the Democrat's plan would increase the burden on families with special needs children.
A top adviser to Sen. McCain said the attack was designed to show the "bizarre, unintended consequences" likely to result from Sen. Obama's proposed tax increases. Raising taxes on top brackets, including trusts, could ensnare special needs families who set up "special needs" trusts to pay for medical and other expenses that come with a disability.
Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential nominee whose infant son, Trig, has Down Syndrome, will debut the new attack during a rally Friday morning in Pittsburgh, aides said, and the campaign said it could launch television or radio ads featuring special needs families targeting Sen. Obama on the issue.
"What you're finding is that in his ideological drive to raise taxes he continually catches new people in the crossfire and this is the latest symptom of that," said senior McCain adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin.
Senior Obama advisor Jason Furman said the attack is a "blatant lie" and said that Sen. Obama has always said he would work with the Treasury Department to adjust thresholds in order to make sure tax rates do not inadvertently increase on any family making less than $250,000 a year.


German Bus Accident Kills 20
Associated Press
HANNOVER, Germany --A German tour bus caught fire on an autobahn near the northern city of Hannover on Tuesday night, killing 20 people after a passenger reportedly sneaked a cigarette, police said.
Survivors told authorities the fire broke out in the bathroom of the bus as it drove down the A2 highway after a person apparently smoked a cigarette there, police spokesman Stefan Wittke said.
When the door was opened, flames shot out and quickly engulfed the bus, he said.
"Passengers who were sitting close to the exit could get away, but the others had no chance," fire department official Claus Roehrbein said.


Medvedev Calls U.S. Policy 'Selfish'
MOSCOW -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev issued a chilly reception to the incoming U.S. administration, threatening to station missiles deep inside Europe and lambasting the U.S. for "selfish" foreign-policy and economic blunders.
Mr. Medvedev also proposed extending the term of the Russian president to six years from four, a change that may benefit his predecessor and prime minister, Vladmir Putin, who may run for president again in 2012.
Without mentioning U.S. President-elect Barack Obama by name, Mr. Medvedev said he hoped the new administration in Washington will take steps to improve badly damaged U.S. ties with Russia. But he suggested it is up to Washington, not Moscow, to improve relations.
"We have no problem with the American people, no inborn anti-Americanism," he said.
Mr. Medvedev's speech, his first state-of-the-nation address since he became president in May, bore few signs of a hoped-for softening toward the West, or of the authoritarian political system established under Mr. Putin.


Congress: Democrats Bolster Majorities
WASHINGTON -- Democrats strengthened their majorities in both houses of Congress and moved close to a level of domination in the Senate that could enable them to push through major legislation.
Combined with Sen. Barack Obama's victory in the presidential race, the congressional results gave Democrats broad power in Washington that they haven't enjoyed in decades.
The Democratic gains represented the final repudiation of the Republican revolution of 1994, marking the second straight strong showing for Democrats in congressional elections. The results return the balance of power that prevailed on Capitol Hill for much of the 20th century, when Democratic-controlled Congresses were the launching pad for Social Security, the modern social safety net and civil-rights legislation.
Democratic leaders have an agenda that harks back to that era, with plans to give government a bigger role in guiding the economy and to strengthen the ability of labor unions to organize in the workplace. They also aim to expand health-insurance coverage and push through a sweeping bill to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.


USDA Lowers Corn, Soybean Forecasts
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture again lowered its forecasts for U.S. corn and soybean production in a report issued Monday.
The last reductions the USDA made for corn and soybean production were in an unusual "corrected" forecast about two weeks ago, on Oct. 28, after USDA officials said they discovered discrepancies in their databases.
In Monday's regularly published monthly supply and demand report, the USDA said the latest reduction for corn production is due to a slight reduction in yield expectations and drops the corn production forecast to 12.02 billion bushels, down from the Oct. 28 forecast of 12.033 billion bushels. The last regularly scheduled Oct. 10 supply and demand report had put corn production this year at 12.2 billion bushels.
The predicted corn yield and production reductions are small, though, the USDA said.
"If realized, this will be the second highest [corn] yield on record behind 2004 and production will be the second largest behind last year," the USDA said.


The Exonerator
DALLAS -- Craig Watkins may be the only prosecutor in America who is making his name getting people out of prison.
As district attorney of Dallas County, Mr. Watkins is using DNA evidence to investigate more than 400 guilty verdicts notched up by his predecessors. His office's Conviction Integrity Unit, launched last year for this purpose, has so far cleared six men wrongly convicted of rape, murder or robbery.
In the past two decades, more than 200 convicts nationwide have been freed thanks in part to DNA testing. The tests involve taking biological material such as blood from the person convicted and comparing it to a sample left at the crime scene. These efforts are usually spearheaded by defense lawyers, not prosecutors.
Mr. Watkins, who became the first African American district attorney in Texas when he was elected in 2006, said in a recent interview that he has been accused of being "a criminal-loving DA, a hug-a-thug DA." But he says such criticism of him and his office misses the point: "We have the constitutional obligation to seek justice."
Each exoneration has pushed Mr. Watkins further into the spotlight. He has been interviewed by television crews from around the globe. The Democratic party in Texas considers him a rising star, though Mr. Watkins says he hasn't made any decisions about running for statewide office.


Sculptor Struggles to Restore JFK Bust
BROOKLYN, N.Y. -- John F. Kennedy was assassinated 45 years ago -- the anniversary is Nov. 22, Saturday. And now that the country has a new first family evoking something of the Kennedy mystique, Neil Estern has been thinking it's high time his sculpture of JFK is put back where it belongs.
It belongs in Grand Army Plaza, a traffic maelstrom in the heart of Brooklyn. The plaza's arch marks the Union's triumph in the Civil War. Set around it are statues of such notables as Gen. Henry Slocum (known as "Slow Come" for his Gettysburg performance) and Alexander Skene, a Scottish gynecologist and Brooklyn immigrant who had an infection (skenitis) named after him.
Facing the vehicular onslaught from Flatbush Avenue at the plaza's northern tip stands a perplexing object: a 7-foot-tall, gray-granite plinth. It has no inscription. "We just call it the monument," said Jonathan Tuczynski, who was doing maintenance work in the plaza one day. "I've been wondering: What's it for?"
Mr. Estern, who is 82 years old, knows only too well: The plinth is intended for a larger-than-life bust of President Kennedy that he delivered to New York City not quite two years after the 1963 assassination. The bust actually stood in the plaza from May 31, 1965, until Oct. 6, 2003, when it was transported in the midst of a construction project to points publicly unknown.
"People keep asking me, 'What happened to the bust? It was taken away and it disappeared,' " Mr. Estern says. "I try to explain that it's a very complicated process."


Juvenile Jurist
The story of last week's Federalist Society dinner gets weirder. It appears that the man who heckled Attorney General Michael Mukasey--shouting "Tyrant! You are a tyrant!"--was a Supreme Court justice from Washington. Don't worry, it wasn't Souter or Breyer. We're referring to the other Washington.
On Friday's episode of Fox News Channel's "The O'Reilly Factor," Wendy Long of the Judicial Confirmation Network identified the heckler as Justice Richard B. Sanders of the Washington state Supreme Court. We emailed Sanders last night asking if he was the heckler. We have not received a response.
We were seated close enough to the heckler to note that he was at Table 50--Sanders's assigned table, according to the dinner program. Although we did not recognize the heckler, we observed that he had white hair and a mustache, as does Sanders in the photo on his personal Web site and in this Cato Institute video. Of the five men assigned to sit at Table 50, we are acquainted with, and would have recognized, three.
Sanders, who was elected to the state Supreme Court in 1995, has a history of controversy. In 1996, just after taking the oath of office, he spoke at an antiabortion rally, where he declared, "Nothing is, nor should be, more fundamental in our legal system than the preservation and protection of innocent human life." Abortion advocates accused him of judicial misconduct, and the Judicial Conduct Commission reprimanded him.
But in 1998, a special panel of the Supreme Court unanimously overruled the reprimand. Although "a judge's right to free speech is subject to limitation by the Canons of Judicial Conduct," Judge C. Kenneth Grosse wrote for the panel, Sanders's statement at the rally did "not clearly and convincingly lead to the conclusion that the words and actions call into question the integrity and impartiality of the judge."


Pakistani Link Boosts Tensions
Indian-Pakistani tensions rose in the aftermath of the deadly terrorist assault in Mumbai, and India's top security official resigned amid recriminations over failure to prevent the attack.
On Sunday, with corpses still being pulled from the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel, India named Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram Home Affairs minister, after Shivraj Patil stepped down from the job to take "moral responsibility" for not stopping the attacks. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will add the finance duties to his responsibilities.
The death toll in the attacks that began Wednesday stood at 174, revised down from 195, as it was determined that some bodies had been counted twice. Among the known dead were six Americans and a dozen other foreigners. Authorities said the toll might rise as a search of the ornate Taj hotel continued.
Nine of the 10 terrorists were killed, though police didn't rule out the possibility others could be at large. The one captured, a 21-year-old Pakistani named Ajmal Qasab, told authorities he had ties to a Pakistani militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, according to a senior Mumbai police officer. That group, listed as terrorist by the U.S., has long fought an Islamic insurgency in Kashmir, which is divided between India and Pakistan.
"Lashkar-e-Taiba is behind the terrorist acts in the city," said Rakesh Maria, joint police commissioner, who added that Mr. Qasab told police the group had intended to hit more targets during their attacks. "The terrorists were from a hard-core group in the L-e-T" and had trained in one of its camps in Pakistan, Mr. Maria said, according to the Associated Press. A previously unknown group called Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility; it's not clear what, if any, ties it might have to Lashkar-e-Taiba.


'At Least Bush Kept Us Safe'
Washington
To drive through the suburbs of Northern Virginia is to marvel still at the widespread wealth, the mansions and mini-mansions that did not exist a quarter-century ago and that now thicken the woods and hills. It used to be sleepy here; it used to be horse farms. I remember looking at one of the new houses 22 years ago. As I explored the heavy, sprawling concrete basement, the agent said, "We think this would take a 40-megaton bomb." She meant it as a serious selling point. We were near Langley.
The other night, the big houses were strung with glittering white Christmas lights—not all different colors, as we do in other suburbs, but stately white—and from the Georgetown Pike, heading toward Great Falls, we saw a house with a big glass-walled living room that faced the street, and below it a glass-walled entrance room, and each had its own brightly decorated tree. "Two Christmas trees," murmured a companion, and it captured the air of prosperity and solid well-being of the area.
It reminded me: Government is our most reliable current and future growth industry, and the near suburbs of the capital are where those who run it, work it, lobby it, feed off it and finagle it live. "You have to go farther out to see the foreclosure signs," said a friend.
At a sparkling Christmas gathering of mostly Republicans, there was warmth, laughter and a mild sense of confusion: "Are we still important?" A handsome former senator, trimmed down and looking younger than he did in office, held forth in the entryway, near a sunny U.S. ambassador who was home for a few days. The ambassador joked that while the country to which she's assigned has long been peaceful, she still has a few weeks to go back and cause mayhem.


Canada's Conservatives Overreach
On Oct. 14 Stephen Harper won re-election as Canada's prime minister. In most modern liberal democracies that would be interpreted as a voter preference for Mr. Harper's leadership to continue. But soon after election day, Canada's hard-left New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois Party began plotting to overthrow the PM in Parliament. And last week, with the help of the Liberal Party, they tried to schedule a vote of no-confidence to carry out their plan.
Mr. Harper fought back by appealing to the governor general for permission to suspend Parliament until Jan. 26, and on Thursday she granted his request. His survival now depends on whether the anti-Harper coalition holds together over the next seven weeks.
This power grab on the heels of Mr. Harper's victory, though perfectly legal, is one for the record books in staid Canada. Americans, however, may be more interested in what brought the three-party, anti-Harper coalition together. It was an attempt by Mr. Harper to do away with public financing of political parties.
There is a similarity between how Canada's Conservatives finance their campaigns and how U.S. President-elect Barack Obama did it. Both could afford to forgo public money because, for both, voluntary giving amounts to much more.


Ghana Candidates Fall Short
ACCRA, Ghana -- None of the candidates managed to win a majority of votes in Sunday's presidential poll, forcing the election to a second round and adding some uncertainty to an otherwise smooth election in this democratic role model of West Africa.
The runoff between the top two candidates, Nana Akufo-Addo and John Atta Mills, will be held on Dec. 28.
The peaceful vote was a relief to many Africans, who watched the election anxiously after elections in Kenya and Zimbabwe earlier this year dissolved into violence. Eight candidates filled the ballot, but the contest was fought largely between Mr. Addo, who is from the ruling party, and Mr. Mills. The current president, John Kufuor, is stepping down after two elected terms.
The country has enjoyed strong economic growth amid high demand for its minerals and cocoa for the past six years, and anticipates an influx of cash from newly discovered oil by 2010. But the global downturn could jeopardize the country's growth.
The results were announced by the electoral commission on Wednesday afternoon, in a cramped room sparsely decorated with balloons and ribbons in the colors of the Ghanaian flag -- red, yellow and green.


U.S. Plans Nuclear Pact With U.A.E.
See Corrections & Amplifications below
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration plans to sign its first nuclear cooperation agreement with a Middle Eastern nation within the next few weeks, according to a senior U.S. official, raising concerns among congressional critics who say the deal could fuel nuclear proliferation in the region.
The proposed deal with the United Arab Emirates has attracted attention because the U.A.E.'s largest trading partner is Iran. The U.A.E. has served in the past as a transshipment point for technology with military applications headed to Iran and other countries and is among Tehran's largest financial partners, according to U.S. officials.
The move could place President-elect Barack Obama in a tight spot with a Middle East ally by forcing him to decide whether to push Congress to ratify the agreement. He hasn't taken an official position on the deal. An Obama spokesman declined to comment. The Bush administration has championed the nuclear agreement with the U.A.E. as a model for promoting peaceful nuclear energy while guarding against weapons proliferation.
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, ranking Republican in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced legislation this week that would set conditions before Congress could approve the agreement. It would require that the next president certify the U.A.E. has taken extensive measures to cut off the flow of financing and sensitive technologies into Iran.


Sweden Bucks Trend on Immigrants
STOCKHOLM -- Sweden is bucking the immigration trend in Europe by opening its labor market to foreign workers of all skill levels without quotas, despite an economic recession and rising unemployment.
Sweden's approach goes beyond the more cautious trend in Europe and most other developed economies, which generally seek to attract a limited number of highly skilled workers. Britain, for example, recently announced a new points system for assessing would-be immigrants. That system streamlines old immigration channels but raises higher hurdles for all but the most highly skilled immigrants from outside the European Union.
On Monday, Sweden began implementing new rules that will give companies greater ability to recruit the foreigners they want to employ. The government hopes the new regulations will help the country deal with labor shortages in the near term and also support an aging population further down the line.
International employment experts said they will be closely watching to asses how the new rules work at a time when economic growth is stalling and unemployment climbs.
"People are going to be watching the Brits, who are putting everything into a point system, and the Swedes, who are doing something entirely different," said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank. People "will be watching to see which system gives better labor market outcomes, both for the employer but also for the immigrants themselves."


Bill George: A Plan to Save GM
It is time for General Motors' board to fulfill its fiduciary duty. GM management has failed to create a viable turnaround plan. The U.S. Senate has refused to bail it out. So the board is the only entity left that can save the company before it gets forced into bankruptcy.
Neither bailouts nor bankruptcy are viable courses of action. The $18 million that GM requested in its most recent bailout, on top of "the innovation R&D bailout" passed by Congress in October, is just a down payment on many more to come. Eventually, taxpayers and even the new administration will get fed up with chasing a downward spiral, especially when it means asking Americans who have no health care coverage to pick up 100 percent of the health care tab for GM employees.
In spite of many calls to let GM go bankrupt from Congress and elsewhere, the GM board is correct in its assessment that American consumers won't want to buy their automobiles from a bankrupt company.
So why doesn't the GM board do the obvious: dramatically downsize the company to make it viable? The only way GM can survive is to consolidate around three brands – Chevrolet cars and trucks, Buick and Cadillac, and sell off or shut down the rest of the company.
The fastest and most efficient way to get this done is to split GM into two companies, a healthy GM and one to be liquidated. These would be separate legal entities with separate shareholders, so that the healthy company cannot be forced to assume the remaining company's liabilities.


FAA Blocks Israeli Airline Expansion
LOS ANGELES -- U.S. aviation regulators downgraded the Israeli government's air-safety oversight system to unacceptable, effectively barring the country's airlines from expanding service to or from the U.S.
The move, which had been expected, comes after a July assessment by the Federal Aviation Administration which found oversight problems affecting airport operations, according to industry and U.S. government officials. The review also found an inadequate number of inspectors and other Israeli government personnel to comply with international safety-oversight standards, these people said.
The downgrade doesn't reflect on the safety programs of individual Israeli carriers or security issues.
In announcing the downgrade, the FAA didn't provide any details of what problems its safety assessment uncovered. Israeli pilot officials have said that a separate, earlier review by the International Civil Aviation Organization -- an arm of the United Nations -- found more than 100 safety-oversight deficiencies. The FAA's decision was based partly on those earlier findings. An Israeli embassy spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment.

A Rigged Auction Derailed
Using government power to help the powerful is a bipartisan tradition, as we've learned watching the brawl over a Federal Communications Commission wireless auction. The good news is that Republican Chairman Kevin Martin's recent attempt to rig the auction was derailed at the last minute, but the same political forces will be back in the Obama Administration.
We say this with confidence because we've learned that one of the politicians lobbying Mr. Martin was none other than Barack Obama's nominee for Labor Secretary, Congresswoman Hilda Solis of California. In an October 3 letter, she urged Mr. Martin to move ahead quickly with an auction with rules that would have benefited a single company, telecom start-up M2Z, at the expense of other bidders.
She did so by playing the race and class cards, suggesting that the auction would make Internet broadband more affordable for poor Hispanics. "As the first Latina to serve on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and a Member of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, I am very concerned about our country's stark broadband divide," she wrote.
You have to give her credit for nerve. The way to increase Internet access and affordability is to promote competition to spur investment and keep prices falling. Experience shows that a rigged spectrum auction slows the process of getting licenses into the hands of those companies best able to put the airwaves to use. It would also cheat the Treasury out of the higher revenues that a clean auction would garner.
Far from aiding the Hispanic working class, Ms. Solis's letter was designed to help M2Z, which is backed by John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and donor to Democratic politicians. In a December 9 letter to the FCC's general counsel, M2Z vice president for regulatory affairs Uzoma Onyeije explicitly cited a letter from Ms. Solis to the FCC endorsing the auction.


Belgium's King Names Likely Prime Minister
BRUSSELS -- Belgium's King Albert II on Sunday named a probable successor to Prime Minister Yves Leterme, who resigned recently amid a scandal related to one of the earliest major bank bailouts of the global credit crisis.
After more than a week of negotiation with the country's fragmented political parties, King Albert asked Herman Van Rompuy, president of the lower house of Belgium's parliament, to form a government. While the person chosen for this role doesn't always get the top job, "in this case, it's absolutely clear Mr. Van Rompuy will become prime minister in a few days," said Olivier Alsteens, a government spokesman.
Mr. Van Rompuy, 61 years old, is a member of the Christian Democrats, the same party that Mr. Leterme belongs to. He earned plaudits as a finance and budget minister in the 1990s when he gradually reduced Belgium's national debt so that the country would meet the criteria to adopt the euro in 1999.
Importantly, given that the last government took nine months to form after elections in 2007, Mr. Van Rompuy will govern with the existing coalition, Mr. Alsteens said. The new prime minister will have to find one new cabinet minister, to replace former Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen, who also resigned amid the banking scandal.
Belgium's next government will have to approve a new budget and figure out how to spend a €2 billion ($2.81 billion) stimulus package. The country's economy is expected to shrink by 0.5% next year, as measured by gross domestic product.


Thaksin Supporters Launch Protests
BANGKOK -- Several thousand supporters of ousted Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra rallied Sunday and early Monday to protest a new government that they say came to power in a virtual coup.
New Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was preparing an $8.6 billion stimulus plan aimed at shoring up Thailand's economy, which he was scheduled to announce Monday morning.
About 3,000 police were on alert Sunday night to control the pro-Thaksin crowd. Antigovernment protesters, almost all of whom wore red shirts in a show of loyalty to Mr. Thaksin, still surrounded the parliament compound early Monday, according to the Associated Press.
The protests served notice to Mr. Abhisit that Thailand's persistent political problems haven't ended since parliament elected him prime minister on Dec. 17, after a wave of defections from some of Mr. Thaksin's former supporters. Mr. Thaksin, a populist premier who led Thailand from late 2001 until he was ousted in a 2006 military coup, is now in self-exile, evading imprisonment on a corruption conviction that he says was politically motivated.
Some political analysts say that the rise of Mr. Abhisit, a 44-year-old, Oxford-educated politician backed by Thailand's traditional bureaucratic, business and military elites, could further polarize the nation by infuriating Mr. Thaksin's mostly poor, rural supporters.


Foreign Leaders Push for Gaza Cease Fire
TEL AVIV -- Israel continued its aerial bombardment of Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday as international pressure for a cease-fire mounted and Israeli officials warned that operations against the militant group were only just beginning.
European foreign ministers met Tuesday in Paris, calling for an end to hostilities and increased access to Gaza for humanitarian purposes. Turkey's prime minister, meanwhile, announced a round of shuttle diplomacy to Arab capitals to consult on a response to the attacks.
The Israeli aerial attack, which began Saturday, has claimed at least 350 Palestinian lives, including 60 civilians, according to United Nations estimates, which haven't been updated since Monday. Palestinian hospital officials said 10 more Palestinians died in Israeli attacks Tuesday, but there was no independent confirmation of that figure. Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian missiles. The U.N. has said that at least 1,400 Palestinians have been wounded. At least 20 Israelis have sustained injuries.
Israel's security cabinet meets Wednesday to discuss the military operation, and Israeli press reports late Tuesday suggested a possible cease-fire would be on the agenda. The military denied an earlier report that it had recommended a 48-hour cease-fire, and a government spokesman said he had no knowledge of plans to discuss a halt to the operation at Wednesday's meeting.


The No-State Solution
Of all the errors in the West's understanding of Hamas, none is more fundamental than the routine characterization of the group as a Palestinian movement. It is nothing of the sort.
This isn't to say that the Islamic Resistance Movement -- to use Hamas's proper name -- isn't led by Palestinians, or that it's unpopular among them. On the contrary: Even before the current fighting, Hamas was almost certainly more popular than its secular rival Fatah throughout the Palestinian Authority, including the West Bank. The only difference with Gaza is that Israel remains a presence on the West Bank, able to prevent Hamas from gaining sufficient strength to rout Fatah in an armed contest.
Hamas's claim on Palestinian hearts has only gained force in the last three weeks, though whether the feeling lasts will depend largely on how it emerges from the war. But the test of Hamas's Palestinian-ness, as it were, has nothing to do with its popularity. The test is whether it actually believes in something called Palestine. There is scant evidence that it does.
Bear in mind that there has never previously been an independent state by that name; politically, it remains a notional place. The idea of a Palestinian people, referring to the Arab inhabitants of the land, is also of relatively recent vintage. (The late, great Israeli pianist David Bar-Ilan, my predecessor as editor of the Jerusalem Post, was known, as a Jewish child during the British Mandate, as the "Palestinian piano prodigy.")
This isn't to deny, as Golda Meir famously did, the existence of a Palestinian people. But it is to say that a Palestinian people -- as opposed to merely an Arab one -- exists only as a kind of counterpart, perhaps a twin, to the Israeli people. Put simply: No Israel, no Palestine.


Religion a Factor in Bolivia Referendum
SANTA CRUZ, BOLIVIA -- A television ad that has aired around the country opens with a photo of Bolivia's leftist President Evo Morales dressed in the garb of a traditional shaman. An image of Jesus Christ arrives to knock Mr. Morales off the screen, and a document labeled "New Constitution" appears amid flames. "Choose God. Vote No," the ad advises.
The ad, funded by an evangelical church based in this stronghold of the political opposition, points up how religion is playing a growing role in the latest chapter of Bolivia's sometimes bloody fight over a new constitution, which is up for a national referendum on Sunday.
The religious fight marks a deepening of the country's political split under Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian who leads the ruling party, the Movement to Socialism. The conflict has pitted poor, heavily indigenous western areas where Mr. Morales is revered against whites and mixed-race mestizos in the natural gas-rich tropical lowlands. More than a dozen people have died in clashes related to the constitutional text.
If approved, Bolvia's constitution would allow Mr. Morales, elected in 2005, to seek a second consecutive five-year term, reshape congress, and extend the state's power -- marking a victory for the strongly anti-American leader who recently expelled the U.S. ambassador, nationalized the country's energy supplies, and whose key patron is Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez.
In both Venezuela and Ecuador, leftist leaders have used referendums as ways to consolidate power and mold their countries along populist lines. Incoming secretary of state Hillary Clinton promised "tough and direct" diplomacy in the region "in response to the fear-mongering propagated by Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales."


Death Sentences in 
SHANGHAI -- Chinese judges imposed severe penalties, including two death sentences, on the first group of defendants convicted in connection with the wide-scale poisoning of dairy products that killed at least six children and sickened nearly 300,000 others.
The sentences announced Thursday in a court in northern China included life imprisonment for Tian Wenhua, the former chairwoman of Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co., the dairy company at the center of one the country's biggest product-safety disasters in recent history. Ms. Tian pleaded guilty last month to charges of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products.
China's leaders have struggled to restore public faith in food safety after the widespread contamination of milk and baby formula with the toxic industrial chemical melamine -- and news that local authorities kept silent about it for at least a month.
The Intermediate People's Court in Shijiazhuang city meted out sentences to 12 defendants in succession, though they weren't all tried together. The move seemed intended to "enhance the deterrent value and the political statement associated with the verdicts," said Lester Ross, a Beijing-based attorney with U.S. law firm WilmerHale.
Some parents of children sickened by tainted milk and critics of the government's handling of the scandal say the scope of prosecutions is too narrow, given the wide scale of the adulteration and the failure of many companies and regulators to protect the public.


Obama Urges Action on Stimulus
WASHINGTON -- With job losses mounting throughout the economy, President Barack Obama said Monday the U.S. can't afford any delay in passing economic-stimulus legislation.
"These are extraordinary times," Mr. Obama said. "And it calls for swift and extraordinary action."
The comments on the economy, at the start of a ceremony devoted to the administration's energy policy, come as the White House looks to bolster support among Republican lawmakers and the public for an $825 billion package of spending and tax cuts to bring the economy out of recession.
The president will meet GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday, meetings that could determine whether the recovery bill passes along party lines or gives Mr. Obama an early bipartisan victory.
Meanwhile, the White House said the second half of the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial-rescue package will be spent "far differently" than the first half, and left the door open for a request for additional funds.


IBM, Apple Settle Dispute
Former International Business Machines Corp. executive Mark Papermaster will begin work at Apple Inc. in April, resolving a tussle over his employment and perhaps signaling that Apple is considering designing some of its own semiconductors.
Mr. Papermaster, who at one time managed IBM's PowerPC chip business, will be a senior vice president of devices hardware engineering for the iPod and iPhone, reporting to Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
Apple said in November it was hiring Mr. Papermaster despite a lawsuit by IBM that attempted to keep him from working at Apple for a year, saying he had signed a noncompete agreement.
One of IBM's likely reasons for the suit was the sensitive information Mr. Papermaster is believed to have on its chip business, especially the PowerPC processor, which the companies developed together nearly 20 years ago. ¶
On Tuesday, Apple said the litigation between IBM and Papermaster had been resolved. IBM said Mr. Papermaster will be required to certify in July and again in October that he has complied with his legal obligations not to disclose IBM's confidential information.


Election Commission Denies Setting Federal Poll Dates
NEW DELHI -- India's Election Commission hasn't yet met to decide dates for federal polls which are due by May this year, a spokesman for the panel told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday.
Denying reports that federal elections will be held between April 8 and May 15, the spokesman said that "the Election Commission of India has not met so far to decide any dates. Any reports on dates, if any, have no authenticity."

Next Stop, France
Last month Barack Obama became the new president of the United States, a president with a different set of beliefs and perspective about how our country should function, change and--hopefully--prosper. The last president with such vision (although from a different perspective) was Ronald Reagan, who according to most scholarly surveys was one of the best presidents in America's history. So a look at what the Obama presidency is planning will help us understand where America is going.
According to last week's Newsweek cover story, "We Are All Socialists Now," the "America of 2009 is moving towards a modern European state"--whether we like it or not. A decade ago our national, state and local government spending was 34.3% of gross domestic product, while next year it will reach 39.9%, and America "will become even more French." So there will be "more government taxing and spending," and "more government intrusion in the economy will almost surely limit growth (as it has in Europe, where a big welfare state has caused chronic high unemployment)."
That conclusion should not surprise us, for more government involvement and decision-making in all aspects of our country's policies, organizations, businesses and local governments is the belief of the Obama presidency. Mr. Obama was the most liberal member of the Senate during his short time there, and, faithful to his beliefs, he has begun establishing the liberal policies he campaigned upon.
Mr. Obama promised to increase federal spending by $303 billion a year, or 10%, but the recessionary emergency spending bill he signed last week will cost a minimum of $790 billion over the next several years. It is the largest annual spending increase since World War II, an enormous deficit-spending bill that, as The Wall Street Journal pointed out, expands "the role of the federal government across the breadth of American business, health care, energy and welfare policy."
If the spending increases and tax reductions of the bill are extended over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates they will add $1.7 trillion to the federal deficit. And since there are no sunset provisions to end the spending increases, we can be sure that any "cuts" in federal spending will be vigorously opposed. Simply put, a much bigger American government is on its way, and as a result a balanced budget will not be possible for the foreseeable future.


Anticorruption and the ADB
From today's Wall Street Journal Asia.
The Asian Development Bank is asking its shareholders -- namely, taxpayers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere -- to pony up between $1.9 billion and $3.4 billion in additional capital. That's a big increase for a bank that lent out $10 billion in 2007. Will that money be spent cleanly? Funny you should ask.
The Bank's integrity division released its annual report for 2008 last week. Despite some successes investigating corruption allegations, a serious problem lingers: its unwillingness to publicly name companies with which it has severed ties due to corruption complaints. The U.S., a major ADB shareholder, is concerned.
The ADB says it received 186 complaints about possible improprieties last year, from which it opened 89 investigations. Based on those findings, and from some pending investigations from 2007, the Bank barred 41 companies and 38 individuals from doing business with it. Just don't ask for the names of those sanctioned companies or individuals, or even in which countries the problem projects are located. The ADB won't say.
Consider the list of cases posted, without any identifying details, on the Bank's Web site alongside the annual integrity report. Several involve possible wrongdoing by government officials in countries receiving ADB loans. In one case, an individual and two firms allegedly bribed a government official to obtain confidential information about the bidding for an ADB project. In another case, two companies and two individuals admitted to bribing government officials to obtain contracts.


Obama Unveils Iraq Exit Timetable
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. -- Nearly six years after President George W. Bush first ordered troops into Iraq, President Barack Obama told thousands of Marines at a sprawling base here that the war would effectively end next summer.
Mr. Obama said roughly two-thirds of the 142,000 American troops now in Iraq will be withdrawn by the latter half of 2010, with the U.S. role in Iraq then shifting from combat to a more limited set of missions. All remaining U.S. troops will leave Iraq by the end of 2011, the president said.
"Let me say this as plainly as I can: By Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," Mr. Obama said Friday to cheers from the Marines crowding a gymnasium here.
Mr. Obama said Iraq faces a host of political, economic and security challenges, and acknowledged, "There will be difficult days ahead." Still, he said the U.S. could no longer afford the costs of large-scale military operations in Iraq.
"America can no longer afford to see Iraq in isolation from other priorities," he said. "We cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that has put a strain on our military, and will cost the American people nearly a trillion dollars."


Argentina, Farmers Reach Agreements
BUENOS AIRES -- Dissident farmers and government negotiators narrowed their differences in a meeting Tuesday with a surprise attendee, President Cristina Kirchner.
It was the president's first face-to-face meeting with farm leaders since last June, and helped calm the waters amid a flurry of recent rumors that the government would assert a drastically expanded role in the marketing and export of agrarian products.
After the meeting, Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said no changes in agrarian marketing were planned in the near term, though he didn't exclude the possibility in the future. Any change would be submitted to Congress, Mr. Randazzo said, which analysts say would likely limit its scope.
The two sides announced agreements to assist producers of dairy products, wheat and cattle. The government reiterated that it wouldn't accede to farmers' key demand, a reduction in a 35% export tax on soybeans. Farm leaders said they would begin consultations on that matter in Congress, where the Kirchner government has lately lost power.

Obama Reviews Policy Toward Sudan
President Barack Obama has launched a "high-level, urgent review" of U.S. policy toward Sudan that will consider whether the U.S. should re-examine joining the International Criminal Court, which the Bush administration had emphatically rejected, a senior White House official said Wednesday. A policy decision should be ready "within weeks."
Mr. Obama campaigned hard on toughening U.S. policy toward Sudan and bringing an end to the fighting in Darfur, which he called genocide. As a senator, Mr. Obama visited Darfurian refugee camps in Chad in 2006 and identified the issue as a priority. The administration's reticent response Wednesday to the ICC's warrants for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir was not meant to convey any slackening of the president's position, but the president did not want to respond to developments in Sudan before a broader framework could be unveiled, the official said.
"His determination to end the atrocities in Darfur has not wavered," the official said. "Our intent is not to address this in piecemeal fashion but to make sure the U.S. and its allies bring about a lasting end to the horrors in Darfur and the rest of Sudan," he said.
Among those involved in the review is National Security Council staff member Samantha Power, who made her career in international diplomacy by working to expose and campaign against genocidal policies. Mr. Obama severed ties to Ms. Power during the campaign after she called then-Sen. Hillary Clinton a "monster." But she has quietly returned to the fold. Other members of the review are drawn from across the government.
Reconsideration of ICC membership will undoubtedly be controversial. Republicans say the court is an abrogation of sovereignty and would expose U.S. servicemen and officials to criminal prosecution. The White House is mindful of the controversy, the official said. "As the review looks at the ICC, we do have to look at how it protects U.S. forces," he said.


9/11 Suspects Respond to Charges
WASHINGTON -- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused in the Sept. 11, 2001, conspiracy called U.S. allegations "badges of honor" and declared themselves "terrorists to the bone" in a written statement slated for public release Tuesday.
The six-page statement, dated March 1, was filed with a military judge at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in response to nine charges filed by military prosecutors last year. Titled "The Islamic Response to the Government's Nine Accusations," the statement mocks American authorities for failing to foil the Sept. 11 plot and casts the U.S. as a terrorist aggressor whose own actions provoked the suicide hijackings that killed nearly 3,000 people.
The statement calls the conspiracy charge "laughable."
"Were you expecting us to inform you about our secret attack plans?" it says. "Blame yourselves and your failed intelligence apparatus and hold them accountable, not us."
"Also, as the prophet has stated: 'War is to deceive,'" it states, in one of several passages that assert religious sanction for al Qaeda attacks.


Madagascar Leader to Allow Vote
Madagascar's president said he would allow a referendum to determine whether he continues as head of state, easing tensions in the island nation in the Indian Ocean. The move also sets the military up as the potential kingmaker.
The country has been enveloped in political paralysis for weeks. Opposition leader Andry Rajoelina, who is also the former mayor of the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend gave President Marc Ravalomanana an ultimatum to resign on Saturday. But Mr. Rajoelina's deadline came and went late Saturday without further action.
The military's level of support for the president remains unclear. On Sunday, the president rallied his own supporters in Antananarivo, and Mr. Ravalomanana offered his most dramatic concession yet: He said he'd agree to a referendum to settle who would lead the country, though he didn't provide specifics.
Military backing is key. So far, the army has made no public expression of support for Mr. Ravalomanana, who was elected president in 2006. That silence suggested to many observers that military leaders were either turning away from the president or -- potentially more worrisome -- divided over the issue.
In recent years, the military has had a stabilizing effect on Madagascar's tumultuous politics. This time, "what's worrying is that they seemed to have split," says Stephen Ellis, a professor at the Free University in Amsterdam, and a Madagascar historian.


Builders Split on Tax Break, Lobbying
A fight within the National Association of Home Builders, one of the nation's largest trade groups, is coming to a head, and the outcome could refocus the industry's lobbying efforts at a critical time for the housing market.
Tensions between large and small builders have escalated in recent weeks over the trade group's position on a lucrative tax break sought by the large companies. Jerry Howard, the NAHB's longtime chief executive, and some small builders have raised concerns that the big builders would abuse the break, igniting a firestorm that could cost Mr. Howard his job.
Executives from some of the trade group's largest home-building companies are scheduled to meet Monday in Chicago with the NAHB leadership to discuss the possibility of ousting Mr. Howard, according to people familiar with the meeting. An NAHB spokesperson declined to comment.
At the meeting in a private club at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, representatives from KB Home , Centex Corp. and Pulte Homes Inc., some of the largest home builders in the U.S., may call for Mr. Howard's ouster or threaten to break away from the 200,000-member trade group, these people said. A Pulte spokesman declined to comment. Executives from Centex and KB Home couldn't be reached.
Either move by the big builders would signal the growing political clout of the publicly traded home builders, which are gaining greater control of the new-home market as smaller builders die by the dozens amid the downturn.


Robert Reich: Obamanomics Isn't About Big Government
Twenty-eight years ago, Ronald Reagan used the severe economic downturn of 1980-82 to implement an economic philosophy that not only gave force and meaning to a wide range of initiatives but also offered a way back to sustained economic growth. Is there a similarly powerful animating idea behind Obamanomics?
I believe there is -- and it's not a return to big government.
The expansive and expensive forays of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board into Wall Street notwithstanding, President Barack Obama's 10-year budget (whose projections may prove wildly optimistic if the economy fails to rebound by early next year) presents a remarkably conservative picture. In 10 years, taxes are expected to fall to around 19% of GDP, a lower level than the late 1990s. Spending is expected to drop to around 22.5% of GDP, about where it was under Ronald Reagan -- including nondefense discretionary spending at about 3.6% of GDP, its lowest since data on this were first collected in 1962.
The real distinction between Obamanomics and Reaganomics involves government's role in achieving growth and broad-based prosperity. The animating idea of Reaganomics was that the economy grows best from the top down. Lower taxes on the wealthy prompts them to work harder and invest more. When they do so, everyone benefits. Neither Reagan nor the apostles of supply-side economics explicitly promised that such benefits would "trickle down" to everyone else but this was broadly understood to be the justification.
Reaganomics surely marked the beginning of one of the longest bull markets in American history and generated enormous gains at the top. But its benefits were not widely shared. After the Reagan tax cuts, growth in the median wage slowed, adjusted for inflation. After George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, the median wage dropped. Meanwhile, an increasing share of total income went to the top 1% of income earners. In 1980, before Reagan took office, the highest-paid 1% took home 9% of total national income. By 2007, before the economy melted down, the richest 1% was taking home 22%.


Turkey's Ruling Party Leads Ballots
Turkey's ruling party looked set to win Sunday's local election, but with a reduced share of the vote, as voters punished the government for its perceived indifference in the face of rising unemployment and an economy plunging into recession.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party won about 40% of the vote with four-fifths of the vote counted, seven percentage points lower than its landslide general election victory in June 2007, according to early results. The secular Republican People's Party, or CHP, was second with 27%, and the Nationalist Action Party had 15%.
The elections were marred by the deaths of at least six people in fighting between rival political groups, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported. Dozens were wounded.
The AK Party appeared to have lost seven provinces it won in local elections in 2004.
One surprise was in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, where the CHP looked set to win 38% of the vote, eight percentage points up from four years ago, and just four points behind the AK Party. Analysts credited CHP's move to reach out to voters beyond its usual base of a small, Westernized elite. The biggest dent to AK Party's hopes to maintain its near-stranglehold on Turkish politics came in the mainly Kurdish southeast where a Kurdish nationalist party dominated three provinces the government won in 2007.


Delaware Court Sides With Boards
Corporate directors should be afforded significant latitude and discretion in deciding whether to accept a merger offer, the Delaware Supreme Court said in a recent ruling.
Corporate-law experts say the decision could make it harder for disgruntled shareholders to recover damages when a merger goes through at a price shareholders view as unacceptably low.
Though the ruling applies only to state law, the Delaware courts are influential in corporate law because so many companies are incorporated in the state. Therefore, the ruling is expected to be noted in other jurisdictions.
The decision, which was handed down Wednesday, said board members at Houston-based Lyondell Chemical Co. didn't act in bad faith when they accepted the 2007 merger offer by Basell International Holdings BV, a Dutch chemical company.
Shortly after the merger was accepted by the Lyondell board, a group of shareholders sued, claiming that the $48-per-share merger price was insufficient and that the directors breached a variety of fiduciary duties. Specifically, the shareholders argued that the Lyondell board failed to prepare for an official merger offer for several months after representatives from Basell initially got in touch.


Ruling Adds Another Twist to Stent Case
A federal appeals court held that Boston Scientific Corp. and Johnson & Johnson 's heart stents each infringe patents held by the other company, adding another step in the decade-long litigation between the two companies.
But the decision didn't bring immediate clarity to the question of who owes what to whom in the $4 billion industry for heart stents -- tiny scaffolds that prop open clogged arteries. For more than a decade, the big makers of heart stents have all been locked in patent-infringement litigation with one another. Boston Scientific recently settled several such cases, including ones with Medtronic Inc.
Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a Washington court that hears patent-related appeals, affirmed judgments that J&J's Cypher stent infringes a 1999 patent owned by Boston Scientific. The court also upheld judgments that Boston Scientific's Liberte and Taxus Express stents infringe patents owned by J&J, including a 1988 patent by Julio Palmaz, a cardiologist considered to be one of the inventors of heart stents.
In a victory for Boston Scientific, the appeals court also ruled that J&J cannot refile claims against Boston Scientific's popular Taxus Liberte heart stent.
No damage figures had been attached to the judgments. Unless today's decision is further appealed, the case will return to a lower court, in Delaware, to decide on a damage award. It isn't clear which company will end up having to pay the other.


'Sampling' Expert to Lead Census
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama Thursday nominated Robert Groves, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, to be the next director of the Census Bureau, a choice that riled some Republican lawmakers.
Mr. Groves, who served as associate director of statistical design at the Census Bureau from 1990 to 1992, is an expert on "sampling," the practice of adjusting statistics in order to compensate for undercounting. This tends to bolster the number of people counted in urban areas that are typically Democratic strongholds. The census, which takes place next April, is used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and disburse billions in federal dollars.
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, whose agency runs the Census Bureau, said during his Senate confirmation hearing that the "Supreme Court has made it very clear that statistical sampling is not permissible for apportionment purposes." Still, the Groves nomination triggered quick reactions on Capitol Hill, where sampling became a volatile issue during the mid-1990s after the 1990 census vastly undercounted minority populations in large cities.
"A sampling process would open the census to the worst kind of political manipulation," said Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who sits on the Senate subcommittee that overseas the census. "The Constitution clearly requires a count of every person, not a best guess that could be influenced by political rather than empirical considerations."
Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat and chairman of the subcommittee, praised Mr. Groves as an "expert in survey methodology and statistics" who "needs no on-the-job training" because of his bureau experience.


Kim Jong Il Makes Public Appearance
SEOUL – Kim Jong Il reemerged in public Thursday and presided over the opening session of North Korea's legislature, his first major public appearance since falling ill last year.
The legislature reappointed Mr. Kim as defense chief in a pomp-filled ceremony preceded earlier this week by the firing of a multistage rocket, which prompted the censure of the U.S. and other countries.
Mr. Kim appeared considerably thinner and older than nine months ago, the Associated Press reported, when he suffered an apparent stroke in August.
Limping slightly as he arrived to a standing ovation from fellow deputies to the 687-seat Supreme People's Assembly, he returned their applause by clapping, then motioned for them to be seated, footage broadcast on state TV Thursday evening showed, according to AP.
Earlier this year, Mr. Kim toured much of North Korea and built attention for the regime before last month's election, where he and candidates for the rubber-stamp legislature received universal support. Mr. Kim's tour also allayed some public concerns about his health.


Obama Weighs Engagement With Cuba
President Barack Obama plans to tell Latin American leaders later this week that the U.S. is willing to discuss how to improve relations with Havana, but wants Cuba to take steps toward democracy before it is reintegrated into the Western hemisphere's economic and political institutions.
Cuba is likely to be at the forefront of discussions at the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of 34 heads of government that has always excluded Cuba, starting April 17 in Trinidad. Cuba's main ally, Venezuela, as well as other countries, have said they want to use the summit to press for closer relations between Washington and Havana. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez stopped in Havana on Friday to coordinate pre-summit strategy with Cuban President Raúl Castro and his ailing bother Fidel.
"Why does Cuba continue to be left out of the Summit of the Americas, if Cuba is a friend of Latin American and Caribbean countries?" Mr. Chávez said during a weekly television address last month.
While the U.S. wants the meeting to focus on the global economic recession, Obama administration officials said the president is ready to engage on the Cuba issue if it's brought up by other leaders. "We won't duck it," said an official. The president is likely to ask other summit-goers to press Cuba on issues of democracy, including the release of political prisoners.
The U.S. willingness to engage on Cuba is another indication of a slow, tentative warming of relations between Washington and Havana. The administration is planning soon to lift longstanding restrictions on Cuba, a move that would allow Cuban-Americans to visit families on the island as often as they like and send them unlimited funds.


More Heat on BofA's Lewis
Two proxy advisory firms recommended Friday that shareholders oppose Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis's re-election as chairman, turning up the heat on the 62-year-old executive as he tries to weather the current crisis.
RiskMetrics Group and Glass Lewis & Co. also joined Proxy Governance, another investor advisor, in asking shareholders to approve a permanent split in the chairman and chief executive roles, a measure up for vote at the bank's April 29 annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C.
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis and Proxy Governance all are calling for lead director Temple Sloan to be removed from the Bank of America board.
The investor-advisory firms are citing the bank's quick decision last fall to buy Merrill Lynch & Co. and not disclose more about its fourth-quarter losses prior to a Dec. 5 shareholder vote as reason for their recommendations.
RiskMetrics said "the entire board will need to be reconstituted in the coming years" and suggested votes against nonexecutive directors Jackie Ward, Frank Bramble, Monica Lozano and Robert Tillman, citing an "absence" of leadership and an unwillingness "to curb Mr. Lewis's penchant for empire building." Glass Lewis also is opposing three former Merrill directors who are up for election.


White House Urging Greenhouse-Gas Cap
WASHINGTON - Top Obama administration officials went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to call for legislation curbing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions but steered clear of specifics on how lawmakers should design such legislation.
The heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department repeatedly sidestepped lawmakers' questions about how climate legislation should work, such as how to distribute the money raised by a system that effectively taxes carbon emissions; whether the bill should include provisions to encourage the development of nuclear power; and how the administration will respond if countries such as China refuse to follow the U.S. in restricting their emissions.
Underscoring the concern that many lawmakers have about damaging U.S. competitiveness, another administration official—Todd Stern, the top U.S. negotiator of climate change agreements with other countries—told a Senate panel Wednesday that the administration will demand "significant, robust" reductions of emissions from China.
Wednesday's hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee coincided with an Earth Day warning by President Obama that unless lawmakers act, the job of regulating U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will fall largely to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is limited under the law in its ability to consider the costs of regulation. The agency last week declared that greenhouse gas emissions endanger health and welfare.
"There's no question that we have to regulate carbon pollution in some way; the only question is how we do it," Mr. Obama said during a visit to a wind energy plant in Newton, Iowa, whose economy was rocked by the closure of a Maytag Corp. appliances plant in 2007.


Blasts Roil Iraq for 2nd Day
BAGHDAD -- A wave of attacks targeting Shiites in Iraq continued Friday as two suicide bombings struck outside the holiest Shiite mosque in Baghdad.
The bombings killed at least 71 people according to reports Saturday.
The attacks came a day after three bombings -- one in Baghdad and two in Diyala province -- left about 80 people dead and capped one of the bloodiest 24-hour periods in more than a year. Since Thursday afternoon, at least 140 people have died and hundreds more have been wounded in five attacks, all but one targeting Shiite holy sites, pilgrims, or predominantly Shiite neighborhoods.
The two suicide bombers on Friday struck within seconds of each other outside gates on opposite sides of the gold-domed Khadhimiya Shrine, according to bystanders who saw the blasts. The mosque is considered the burial site of the Imam Musa al-Khadhim, one of Shiite Islam's 12 imams, and has been a frequent target for Sunni extremists.
One bomber detonated his vest in the middle of a crowd of Iranians making pilgrimages to the shrine, a spokesman for the Iraqi military in Baghdad said.


Pay-to-Play Probes Go Nationwide
New York state's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, said he has formed a new task force with 36 other state attorneys general to share information about and prosecute abuses of government pension funds.
"The task force will allow us to have a unified, efficient method for gathering information as we fight to combat corruption and restore transparency and integrity to public pension funds," Mr. Cuomo said in a prepared statement.
The coordinated approach is the latest sign that a two-year-old investigation into an alleged pay-to-play scheme at New York State's pension fund is broadening to funds in other states.
Separately, Mr. Cuomo said on Friday that he is investigating whether middlemen known as placement agents are properly registered as securities brokers.
Placement agents work for investment firms such as private-equity firms to help them get investments from pension funds and other large investors.


Lending Practices Remain Tight
WASHINGTON -- The number of U.S. banks that have tightened lending practices in recent months remains "very elevated" -- with a larger fraction of banks making it harder for consumers to get residential mortgages, according to a Federal Reserve survey of bank executives released Monday.
At the same time, bank officials said demand for loans in the first quarter of the year weakened. In fact, demand fell for every type of loan except prime mortgages, which saw an increase in demand for the first time since the survey began to track prime mortgages separately in April 2007, according to the report.
Looking ahead, the survey finds that banks expect credit quality to deteriorate over the year as the recession continues.
The Fed's quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices is based on responses from 53 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Banks received the Fed survey in late March and their responses were due in mid-April.
Overall, the results are mixed.


Chrysler Creditors Give Up Challenge
A group of Chrysler LLC lenders who opposed the government's restructuring plan for the auto maker agreed to abandon the fight after deciding that the financial and political costs were too high.
The creditors withdrew their legal protest on Friday after two of the larger funds, OppenheimerFunds and Stairway Capital, left the dissident group. The two funds also indicated they would accept the outcome of the auto maker's bankruptcy-court proceedings.
The collapse of the organized opposition removes the final significant hurdle to the Obama administration's efforts to get Chrysler reorganized swiftly in Chapter 11 bankruptcy court. The company could now emerge from the process as early as next month in a new alliance with Italy's Fiat SpA.
The five firms represented the last of a group of about 20 hedge and distressed-debt funds that refused last week to go along with an agreement, forged between the U.S. Treasury Department and four large banks, to take a $2 billion cash payout for the $6.9 billion in secured loans to Chrysler.
The group rose in opposition to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other key banks that had received $90 billion in government funding under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TAR. The dissident group identified itself as Chrysler's "Non-TARP lenders."


Obama Weighs Indefinite Detention
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is weighing plans to detain some terror suspects on U.S. soil -- indefinitely and without trial -- as part of a plan to retool military commission trials that were conducted for prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The proposal being floated with members of Congress is another indication of President Barack Obama's struggles to establish his counter-terrorism policies, balancing security concerns against attempts to alter Bush-administration practices he has harshly criticized.
On Wednesday, the president reversed a recent administration decision to release photos showing purported abuse of prisoners at U.S. military facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama cited concern that releasing the pictures could endanger U.S. troops. Mr. Obama ordered government lawyers to pull back an earlier court filing promising to release hundreds of photos by month's end as part a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The decision to block the detainee photos contrasts with the administration's release last month of Bush-era Justice Department memorandums outlining the interrogation tactics used on prisoners by the Central Intelligence Agency. The release of the memos set off a heated political fight, with supporters of the Bush administration accusing the Obama White House of endangering the country and some of the current president's supporters calling for criminal probes of those responsible for the interrogation policies.
The administration's internal deliberations on how to deal with Guantanamo detainees are continuing, as the White House wrestles with how to fulfill the president's promise to shutter the controversial prison. But some elements of the plans are emerging as the administration consults with key members of Congress, as well as with military officials, about what to do with Guantanamo detainees.


Obama's Detention Plans Face Scrutiny
The Obama administration's efforts to craft what it calls a "preventive detention" plan for suspected terrorists will face constitutional challenges similar to those raised against the Bush administration's policies.
Some detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are deemed too dangerous to release and may not be able to put on trial, creating a quandary that President Barack Obama said Thursday poses "the toughest issue we will face."
There are still many unknowns in the administration's plans. How many prisoners will fall into the thorniest category requiring indefinite detention is still unclear while detainee cases are being reviewed by government lawyers. A White House task force reviewing detention policy is set to make recommendations in late July.
The administration has floated with Congress a possible plan that would seek legislation allowing the government to hold suspected terrorists without trial indefinitely on U.S. soil. A National Security Court would oversee the cases. Administration lawyers view the congressional and court oversight of the plans as key to their argument that their approach differs significantly from the Bush administration, which tried to claim broad presidential powers to strip terror suspects of legal rights.
There's a tradition of indefinite detentions by the military in war time. However, the government's argument that the campaign against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups may be a war without end creates complications.


Protecting Your Social Security and Pension from Creditors
When Philip Dodson, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, checked his bank account online and found he was missing $3,634, he thought he'd been the victim of identity theft.
But he discovered that the money, from his veteran's pension and his and his wife's Social Security, had been taken--by his bank. Mr. Dodson had an overdue credit-card bill, and Bank of America Corp. tapped his checking account to pay it.
Federal law says creditors can't take Social Security, veterans, disability and pension benefits to pay a debt. But it happens anyway. (See related article.) Until better protections are put in place your benefits can be at risk when they're supposedly safe in the bank.
Here's how to reduce the risk retirement benefits will be seized, and what you can do to get the money back if that happens:
RISK: Your bank takes money from accounts containing Social Security, pension, disability or veteran's benefits to repay a credit card debt, auto loan, or mortgage you took out with the bank.


Obama Calls for Unity With Muslims
CAIRO, Egypt -- President Barack Obama waded into the heart of the Middle East conflict Thursday by forcefully reiterating his support for a Palestinian state and admonishing the Arab world to pursue peace with Israel as he made his long-awaited appeal to mend the rift between America and the Muslim world.
In a wide-ranging speech before students at Cairo University that celebrated the common values of the two cultures, Mr. Obama called for a "new beginning" in the relationship.
"I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear," he said to repeated applause in the ornate-domed Great Hall. "But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. "
Most notable in the hourlong address was Mr. Obama's reiteration of his support of a state for Palestine, and his rejection of continued construction by Israel of new settlements on disputed land. The policy puts him in direct conflict with the new government in Israel, led by Benjamin Netanyahu. The president also demanded that Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, recognize Israel and renounce violence.
"Palestinians must abandon violence..At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's," said Mr. Obama.


CFTC Chief Details Derivatives Plan
WASHINGTON -- The head of the federal commodities regulator laid out his vision for how the Obama derivatives regulatory plan should be implemented Thursday, telling lawmakers that any new laws must cover every dealer and every type of derivative.
In prepared testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler recommended amending the Commodity Exchange Act to require all derivatives dealers for the first time to register with regulators.
In addition, he called on lawmakers to expand the CFTC's enforcement powers over swaps and give the agency the authority to set position limits across all markets to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation.
"By fully regulating the institutions that trade or hold themselves out to the public as derivative dealers we can oversee and regulate the entire derivatives market," Mr. Gensler said. "All derivative dealers should be subject to capital requirements, initial margining requirements, business conduct rules and reporting and record keeping requirements."
Thursday marked the first Congressional hearing since the Obama administration rolled out its plan last month to bring over-the-counter derivatives under the tent of federal regulation -- a market that was deregulated with the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000.


T-Mobile Says Customer Data Not Stolen
T-Mobile USA on Tuesday denied speculation that a security breach resulted in stolen customer and corporate data.
Reports surfaced Monday on Web sites with claims that T-Mobile's servers had been accessed by an outside party, and that crucial data was taken. T-Mobile acknowledged the breach, but denied that any information was pilfered.
"The company is conducting a thorough investigation and at this time has found no evidence that customer information, or other company information, has been compromised," T-Mobile said in a statement.
The carrier, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG , also said it was taking additional measures to protect its systems and customer data.
Security breaches have become a growing threat, particularly within the wireless industry. In November, Verizon Wireless employees accessed then President-elect Barack Obama's personal cellphone account, prompting quick disciplinary action. Hackers have developed bugs and other viruses capable of invading cellphones, although those threats are in their early stages.


Anglo Irish Sees Large Loan Losses
DUBLIN -- Anglo Irish Bank Corp. Executive Chairman Donal O'Connor said Tuesday the bank's potential loan losses total €7.5 billion ($10.43 billion) and he expects further impairments of €1.5 billion-€3.5 billion after the government sets up its "bad bank."
Mr. O'Connor told a parliamentary committee that each 10% fall in land and development values would result in impairments of €1.5 billion for the recently nationalized bank and that he sees conditions continuing to deteriorate.
Last month, Ireland's Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said he will seek European Union approval to inject €4 billion into Anglo Irish to cover a record loss. The bank reported a net loss of €3.8 billion for the six months ended March 31, compared with a €550 million profit in the year-earlier period. Loan-impairment charges totaled €4.1 billion for the six-month period.
"Anglo's funding position is exacerbated by governance issues and uncertainty over the bank's future strategy," Mr. O'Connor said Tuesday, adding that the bank has increased reliance on central bank funding. However, he said retail funding is "resilient."
Analysts say the funding environment for the embattled bank is hampered by Standard & Poor's downgrade on Monday of Irish sovereign debt to AA from AA with a negative outlook.


Windows to Drop Browser in Europe
Microsoft Corp. , facing antitrust concerns in Europe, will release the coming version of its Windows operating system, Windows 7, without a Web browser in the region.
The move comes after European Union regulators said in January that including a browser in Microsoft's Windows operating system likely breached European antitrust rules. Windows is on more than 90% of the world's computers.
In a statement on the company's Web site Thursday, Dave Heiner, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, confirmed the plans affecting its Internet Explorer browser software. "Given the pending legal proceeding, we've decided that instead of including Internet Explorer in Windows 7 in Europe, we will offer it separately and on an easy-to-install basis to both computer manufacturers and users," he said.
"This means that computer manufacturers and users will be free to install Internet Explorer on Windows 7, or not, as they prefer."
The statement followed an earlier report from CNet.com. Windows 7 is scheduled to be generally available Oct. 22.


Iraqis Seek Clues from Iran Vote
BAGHDAD--Iraqis watched the weekend election drama unfolding in next-door Iran, eager to read into the results any signals about future ties between the two Mideast giants.
Iraq has close historical links to Iran. After strained relations following the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the two countries warmed to each other after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. Many current Iraqi government officials lived in exile in Iran during their opposition years to Saddam Hussein.
Diplomatic and economic ties have soared between the two, so much so that many Iraqi businessmen complain about Iranian economic encroachments.
Iranian state media has declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner, after posting preliminary results showing him far outpacing his closest rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi. Mr. Mousavi, however, has refused to accept those results, alleging wide-spread voting flaws.
Basim al-Shara, a local journalist in Baghdad, said Iraqis are watching to gauge any impact on Iraq. While Iran's Supreme Leader--not the country's president--has final say over all policy matters, Mr. Ahmadinejad's fiery anti-Western rhetoric has come to define Iran's ambitious bid for increased influence in the region.


Israel Offers Plan for Palestinian State
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke with his past pronouncements and said he would accept a Palestinian state as long as it was demilitarized and had limited governing powers.
Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly stated that his government was interested in peace with its Arab neighbors, in comments Sunday meant to ease pressure from a White House eager to end the Middle East conflict. His remarks, welcomed by Washington but immediately rejected by Palestinian leaders, included an offer to travel "at any time" to all parts of the Arab world to make peace.
But to achieve such an outcome, he reiterated his government's positions on the need to ensure the Jewish state of Israel, the status of Jerusalem as its capital, and the right for Jewish settlers to live in the West Bank, an issue that the administration of President Barack Obama says is an impediment to peace.
"A fundamental condition for ending the conflict is the Palestinians recognizing..that Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people. If we receive this..we will be prepared for a true peace agreement, to reach a solution of a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state," Mr. Netanyahu said.
Israeli officials are hoping for a positive response from Washington on the other major theme of Mr. Netanyahu's speech: The threat his nation sees in Iran, especially in light of this weekend's disputed elections. He opened his address by calling Iran's nuclear ambitions "the greatest threat facing Israel, the Middle East, the entire world and human race." In recent months, Mr. Netanyahu has argued in Washington that Iran's nuclear ambitions, not Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, should be the central pillar of American Middle East policy.


The Trouble With African Elections
In Africa, presidential elections have become the fashionable norm, like state airlines used to be. This year there will be 15 of them. But like those airlines, in the absence of supporting institutions elections have proved to be more decorative than functional, a veneer beneath which the autocratic rule of the pre-1991 era continues little abated. Autocracy in Africa was ruinous: Narrow ethnically based elites plundered the country for their own short-term benefit. America and the other Western countries that encouraged democracies were right to think that what Africa needed was accountability of government to citizen, but wrong to think that this could be achieved simply by elections.
Africa needs democracy and a few countries have it. The African National Congress has just won the South African elections. No surprise there. Other elections in southern Africa will shortly follow. In October, Mozambique will go to the polls. The election should be peaceful and clean, a testimony to the country's progress. Angola will hold presidential elections sometime later this year and unfortunately, this is likely to be a different story. Don't expect a cliff-hanger: Already 30 years in office, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is heading for his fourth decade. Angola totally lacks the institutions necessary, such as a free press and an independent judiciary, for an election to give an opposition party any chance of gaining power.
The era of naive faith in elections began following the fall of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leaders had been utterly allergic to contested elections. We assumed they were right to be allergic: Elections would topple dictators. And so, in Eastern Europe and then around the developing world, we pretty well defined the switch to freedom in terms of contested elections. We now know that Soviet leaders were dumb: They had such unrestricted power that they would have been able to win contested elections easily. As long as an incumbent leader has enough options, facing an election need not be too daunting.
One potential weakness of elections in developing countries is that electorates may be so ill-informed about economic issues that they support populist politicians. This has been the recent experience in parts of Latin America such as Venezuela and Bolivia.


Court Rules Against Convict Over DNA Test
WASHINGTON -- Convicts have no constitutional right to DNA testing, the Supreme Court found, a ruling that left the accessibility of potentially critical evidence to the discretion of individual states.
In a 5-4 vote along the court's ideological divide, the conservative majority acknowledged that "modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before." But the opinion, by Chief Justice John Roberts, drew a sharp distinction between defendants, who are presumed innocent at trial, and convicts like William Osborne, who was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment for kidnapping, raping and shooting an Alaska prostitute in 1993.
"A criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man," Chief Justice Roberts wrote, adding that it remains an "open question"whether "proof of 'actual innocence'" is enough to overturn a conviction after a fair trial.
The court found that the Constitution's Due Process Clause doesn't require the government to provide Mr. Osborne access to evidence simply because modern DNA testing was virtually certain to establish whether semen and pubic hairs found at the crime scene matched his.
Following the ruling, the Obama administration and leading congressional Democrats said they would push for wider access to DNA testing.


Anglo Rejects Offer From Xstrata
LONDON—Global diversified miner Anglo American PLC Monday called "unacceptable" a merger proposal from rival Xstrata PLC, setting the stage for a lengthy battle to woo shareholder support for a deal that would create a new mining giant.
"The board has .. concluded that the strategic case for the combination is unattractive for Anglo American shareholders. Irrespective of this lack of strategic merit, the terms proposed by Xstrata were totally unacceptable," U.K.-based Anglo said in a statement.
Xstrata Sunday said it had sent a proposal to Anglo's board seeking consideration of a tie-up, a combination that would displace Rio Tinto as the world's third-largest miner by market value, after BHP Billiton and Brazil's Cia. Vale do Rio Dose.

Cigna CEO Hanway to Retire
Cigna Corp. CI -0.15% Chairman and Chief Executive H. Edward Hanway will retire at year's end after a decade at the helm of the insurer.
The company will use the opportunity to split the chairman and CEO posts.
President and Chief Operating Officer David Cordani will become CEO on Jan. 1, 2010, and was appointed to the board. Independent director Isaiah Harris Jr. will become chairman.
The 43-year-old Mr. Cordani assumed his current posts in June 2008. He joined the company in 1991. "David has established himself as a highly qualified professional who is ideally suited to lead the company for many years," Mr. Hanway said. "David's passion for our customers and for enhancing the health and productivity of the individuals we serve embodies all that we value and stand for as an organization. Mr. Harris, 56, has been a Cigna director since 2005. He was an executive at BellSouth, which was acquired by AT&T Inc. T 0.74% in 2006. The 57-year-old Mr. Hanway is leaving Cigna at a rough time for the industry, as health-insurance membership for many is falling. The company in April also said this year's decline could be worse than expected. Cigna shares were up 1% after-hours at $23.96. Write to Kevin Kingsbury at 


Iran Opposition Leaders Surface
BEIRUT -- Iranian opposition figures re-emerged to accuse the government of a virtual coup against its people and plan a new political party, even as the regime hardened its crackdown on opponents and accused them of endangering national security.
The tensions within Iran reignited just as Tehran's diplomatic conflict with the European Union heated up, with the government threatening to cut off relations with EU countries unless they apologize for considering pulling their ambassadors out of Iran.
Increasingly, the government has been seeking to cast its opponents as outlaws. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi has been blamed for the blood spilled during the clashes between protestors and security forces over the outcome of the presidential election, in which the government says he came in a distant second to the incumbent, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
On Wednesday a student wing of the Basij -- plainclothes militia responsible for crushing protestors with guns, batons and chains -- asked Tehran's chief prosecutor to investigate Mr. Mousavi's role in "destabilizing national security." If charged and convicted, Mr. Mousavi could face a maximum 10 years in prison.
Mr. Mousavi lashed back, joined by former President Mohammad Khatami, an influential cleric who has supported Mr. Mousavi's campaign but who had become quiet as the regime made clear it wouldn't accept further opposition to the election results.


British Embassy Staff in Iran Will Be Tried, Top Cleric Says
BEIRUT-- Iran deepened its diplomatic crisis with the European Union on Friday when a senior cleric declared detained Iranian staff of the British embassy would be put on trial for provoking post-election unrest.
Delivering the Friday prayer sermon in Tehran, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, an ultra-hard liner, said the British embassy staff had confessed to plotting turmoil in Iran. "In these events, their embassy had a presence. Some people were arrested. Well, inevitably, they will be put on trial," said Mr. Jannati, who is a spiritual guide of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
It is unclear whether Mr. Jannatti's comments will lead to legal action by the judiciary, as harsh rhetoric is customary during Friday prayer sermons in Iran and it doesn't always lead to action. But charges of threatening national security and instigating unrest are extremely serious in Iran and, if convicted, the staffers could face years in prison.
The news shook European nations and fueled calls for tough and immediate diplomatic action against Iran. European Union members had threatened to temporarily pull out all their ambassadors in protest of Tehran's actions if the staffers aren't released.
Britain has been calling for an immediate release of its staff since the diplomatic crisis began last Saturday. "We are very concerned by these reports and are investigating. Allegations that our staff is involved in fermenting unrest are wholly without foundation. We will be seeking an urgent explanation from the Iranians," said a spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign Office in London on Friday.


U.N. Chief Outlines Vision for Myanmar
U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon outlined his vision for a democratic Myanmar in a public speech in Yangon on Saturday.
July 4, 2009
Excellencies, Distinguished guests and colleagues Ladies and Gentlemen, This is my second visit to Myanmar in just over a year. Both visits have been at critical times for the country's future. My first visit was in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. This devastating natural disaster, which took so many lives and created so much hardship, touched hearts across the globe. In Myanmar's moment of need, the world responded generously. I want to personally thank everyone here today for your remarkable contributions to the relief and recovery effort. You have saved lives, rejuvenated communities and made it possible for many thousands of people to reclaim their livelihoods. You have helped Myanmar to overcome adversity. It is important that this work continues. Ladies and Gentlemen, I felt the tragedy of Cyclone Nargis deeply -- as a fellow Asian and as Secretary-General. I am Asia's second Secretary-General. The first was Myanmar's U Thant. I revere his memory. I also recall his wise words. U Thant said: "The worth of the individual human being is the most unique and precious of all our assets and must be the beginning and end of all our efforts. Governments, systems, ideologies and institutions come and go, but humanity remains." This is why I have returned.
As Secretary-General, I attach the highest importance to helping the people of this country to achieve their legitimate aspirations. The United Nations works for people – their rights, their well-being, their dignity. It is not an option. It is our responsibility. I have come to show the unequivocal shared commitment of the United Nations to the people of Myanmar. I am here today to say: Myanmar – you are not alone. We want to work with you for a united, peaceful, prosperous, democratic and modern Myanmar. We want to help you rise from poverty.
We want to work with you so your country can take its place as a respected and responsible member of the international community. We want to help you achieve national reconciliation, durable peace and sustainable development. But, let me emphasize: neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights.


Link Probed in S.C. Spree Killing
Authorities were trying to deterimine Monday whether a man killed in a shootout with police is a suspected serial killer blamed for five deaths in a South Carolina town about 30 miles away.
Police investigating the shootings over the past week in and around the town of Gaffney, S.C., traveled northeast to Gastonia, N.C., where police said they stopped a man attempting to burglarize a home. Officials, who didn't identify the man, said he shot at officers before they returned fire.
A champagne-colored Ford sport-utility vehicle was parked at the scene. Authorities believe the South Carolina serial killer's vehicle fits the description.
Business leaders in Gaffney, which has a population of 13,000, were keeping their fingers crossed that the authorities had found their man. Concerned that the mysterious killings could threaten the town's fragile economy, they had scheduled a Tuesday vote to increase a $20,000 reward Cherokee County Sheriff Bill Blanton announced Monday.
With the killer at large, anxiety rose in recent days about safety at the Friday kickoff of the county's annual South Carolina Peach Festival, a crucial tourism and economic driver for a county struggling with 17.3% unemployment, according to May figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.


Job Openings Remained Scant in May
Employers were less willing to hire in May and employees were more reluctant to quit, making it more difficult for the unemployed to find work, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
There were about 5.7 unemployed workers for every job opening in May, up from about 5.5 a month earlier. As the growing number of job seekers meets the shrinking pool of openings means people are out of work longer, crimping consumer spending and shrinking government budgets.
"There are huge lines in front of the door of every job opening," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington.
May data on job openings and labor turnover showed the drop in the rate of job openings at employers has started to flatten out. The report's silver lining was the latest in a string of indicators that show the U.S. economy may be nearing bottom.
There were 2.6 million job openings on the last day of May, about the same as a month earlier, but down from four million openings in May 2008. The seasonally adjusted job-openings rate was 1.9% in May, the same as in April and down from 2.8% in May 2008.


Talks Begin on Future of Honduras
(Please see correction & amplification item below.)
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya and the men who kicked him out of power nearly two weeks ago began mediated talks Thursday in a bid to end the Central American country's biggest political crisis in decades.
Even as negotiations over the future of Honduras's government began in Costa Rica, however, hopes were dim for a quick solution. Mr. Zelaya has said the only solution is his return to power, while Roberto Micheletti, the man who replaced him as president, says everything can be discussed except Mr. Zelaya's return as president.
The talks will test the diplomatic skills of mediator Óscar Arias, Costa Rica's president, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to ending civil wars in the region. When the Obama administration this week suggested Mr. Arias as a mediator for the crisis, the sides quickly agreed.
In separate sessions, Mr. Zelaya and Mr. Micheletti each met with Mr. Arias. The adversaries didn't meet face-to-face. At the end of the first day of talks, Mr. Micheletti, saying he was "totally satisfied" with the progress, flew back to Honduras, leaving a four-man commission to continue the discussions.


Sotomayor Defense on Comment Evolves
WASHINGTON -- When Judge Sonia Sotomayor faces the Senate Judiciary Committee next week, she will finally get to explain before the cameras her comment that a "wise Latina" can often reach a better conclusion than a white man. That response could help determine whether her confirmation is smooth or rocky.
Despite the furor surrounding the remark -- which she made at a law school in 2001, among other occasions -- Judge Sotomayor hasn't been able to address it publicly since her nomination, because nominees typically don't speak out before their hearings.
However, she did discuss it privately when she made the rounds of senators following her nomination. Based on those discussions, she is likely to say that her judicial record shows no hint of the bias or activism that critics see in the remark. She also is expected to defend the importance of diversity on the bench, while perhaps offering a nod to critics by calling her choice of words imperfect.
"I asked her that question..and she was very direct," said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.). "She just said, '[Latina identity] is something that informs my experience, but I'm always going to look to judicial precedent, I'm always going to follow the rule of law.'"
Manuel Miranda, a former aide to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who is working against Judge Sotomayor's confirmation, said that "the whole race-bias issue" suggested by the remark will probably be the liveliest part of the hearing. "I think that's explosive, I think that's worthwhile, I think that's entertaining," Mr. Miranda said. "Then it becomes pretty boring."


In Mauritanian Vote, a Test for U.S.
NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania -- Mauritania's elections Saturday following 10 months of military rule will mark a return to democracy -- and determine whether this vast West African desert nation returns to the camp of Arab moderates or retains its recent alliance with radical regimes.
The outcome of the presidential vote also will test the wisdom of a policy that is unusual in the U.S.'s dealings with the Arab world: placing democratic principles ahead of more pragmatic considerations such as the fight against terrorism, rolling back Iranian influence, and promoting Israeli-Arab peace.
Mauritania had been firmly in the pro-Western camp when Gen. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz deposed democratically elected President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi in August 2008. At the time, Mauritania was the only Arab country besides Egypt and Jordan to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel. A small U.S. military contingent was deployed here to help fight al Qaeda-affiliated militants in the Sahara.
To justify the coup, Gen. Aziz accused President Abdallahi, who had legalized a moderate Islamist party, of being complacent about the al Qaeda threat. The junta openly said at the time that it expected U.S. support, which has often been extended to authoritarian rulers in other countries facing Islamist insurgency.
Washington didn't take the bait. Insisting that Mr. Abdallahi remained the legitimate president, the U.S. and its European allies refused to deal with the Mauritanian putsch leaders. Gen. Aziz even reached out to Israel, both Israeli and Western officials say, hoping that the Jewish state, to preserve a rare Arab friendship, could convince Washington to soften.


Push in Flu Fight Set for Start of School
U.S. health officials are preparing intensively to combat an anticipated wave of outbreaks of the new H1N1 flu when children return to school and the pace of cases picks up.
Identified by scientists just three months ago, the new swine-flu virus has reached nearly every country, spreading tenaciously with what the World Health Organization this week called "unprecedented speed." Rather than die down in the summer as some experts initially expected, it is continuing to proliferate even in countries like the U.S. and U.K. that are in the full bloom of summer, when the march of influenza normally slows down. It is also spreading rapidly in the Southern Hemisphere.
Anne Schuchat, chief of immunization and respiratory diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that the agency expects an increase in cases before the normal start of the flu season in mid-autumn, because children are likely to spread it to one another once they go back to school. Infectious diseases normally spread readily among children, and this virus has hit children and young adults harder than the elderly, who normally suffer the heaviest toll from flu.
"We've seen it in camps and military units," Dr. Schuchat said. "I'm expecting when school reopens and kids are all back together, in some communities at least we may see an increase."
The number of confirmed U.S. infections is now 40,617, with 263 deaths, the CDC said Friday. But the agency believes that more than one million people have been infected and weren't tested for the virus or didn't visit a doctor. The disease has become so widespread that the agency will probably suspend tallying individual case counts within the next few weeks and focus instead on tracking clusters, severe cases, deaths and other unusual events -- a more traditional approach to tracking diseases, Dr. Schuchat said.


Obama Weighs In on Gates Arrest
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama, who has been reluctant to emphasize race, weighed into racial politics Wednesday, saying the Cambridge, Mass., police "acted stupidly" in arresting Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.
"We know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law [enforcement] disproportionately," the president said at the conclusion of a prime-time press conference. "That's just a fact."
Mr. Gates is one of the most prominent African-American historians in the country and a friend of the president's. He was arrested in his home this week after he and a cab driver forced their way into a jammed front door.
The police report indicates Mr. Gates refused to show the officer an identity to prove he lived there. Mr. Gates said he did, but the officer refused to believe it.
The president was quick to say he did not know all the facts, joking that if he was caught jimmying the lock on his new front door, at the White House, "I'd get shot."


Pyongyang Seizes Boat From South
SEOUL -- North Korea seized a South Korean fishing vessel and its four-person crew after they strayed across the inter-Korean maritime border in the East Sea, or Sea of Japan, early Thursday, South Korean officials said.
The incident will be a new test of how North Korea will deal with the outside world. Since the illness of dictator Kim Jong Il last August, North Korea has taken a harder line in its dealings with foreigners, most visibly with its detention of two American journalists and a South Korean businessman.
The 30-ton ship was about 20 miles off the coast when it crossed the borderline around 6:20 a.m. It was approached by a North Korean military ship a short time later.
South Korea officially requested the return of the crew and vessel at 8:50 a.m., via a hot line the two countries routinely use, said a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Unification, which deals with the North. There was no immediate response from the North.
Inter-Korean border crossings at sea are rare and more often occur with North Korean fishing boats -- which aren't likely to be equipped with sophisticated navigation devices -- straying into South Korean waters.


Let the Sun Shine In at the Fed
I was amused to read about Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's claims that an audit would threaten the Fed's independence ("Bernanke Heads to Congress Battling Calls to Tame the Fed," page one, July 21). The court system operates with a high degree of transparency, and yet no one thinks that undermines its independence. In fact, by Mr. Bernanke's logic, why not just allow the entire government to operate in almost total secrecy to make sure it is never subject to short-term political pressure? Mr. Bernanke clearly either doesn't understand the difference between oversight and political pressure or is just grabbing at straws to avoid accountability.
Ethan Sudman
Gurnee, Ill.
Some of the most strident opponents of any new examination of the Fed have ties to financial institutions that can benefit immensely from Fed actions. Their cry that an audit will destroy "independence" is difficult to substantiate. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to create our money. Are we to believe that they do not have a mandate and responsibility to examine the institution they created in 1913 to do this job?


McCourt Wasn't Much of a Catholic
Regarding Peter Duffy's "The Faith of Frank McCourt" (Houses of Worship, July 24): American contemporaries of Frank McCourt attending Catholic grammar schools in the 1930s and '40s were astute enough to understand that the priests and teaching nuns and brothers were devoting their lives to us under vows taken before God. We were also keenly aware of the restrictive community life they lived for our benefit, at a time in our lives when we were expanding our own liberties.
We listened as they taught us that we were made in the image and likeness of God, and instructed us in the faith using the peerless Baltimore Catechism.
They sought their salvation helping us seek ours. Did Mr. McCourt fail to understand this in his miserable Limerick?
Neither Frank McCourt nor Peter Duffy has anything to tell us about the Roman Catholic faith or the Catholic Church.

Ruff Abstractions of the Universe
VIENNA -- The closer you get to Thomas Ruff's blown-up prints, the less they seem to say. Mr. Ruff's lens hovers only on the surfaces of things, and to our consternation, no deeper. The German photographer's latest works on show at the Kunsthalle in Vienna -- close-ups of Saturn's candy-colored moons and rings, wiry depictions of electromagnetic force fields -- remind of his large portraits, where a shadowless light flattens each face to the point that it begins to look like a mask. Despite the meticulous capture of each hair, pore and wrinkle, the portrait remains startlingly cool and neutral -- and progressively less trustworthy.
For his new Cassini series, Mr. Ruff plucked images from the public Internet archive of NASA. The hyperreal becomes toy-like and fantastic as blue and orange planet bodies are shown suspended in violet or olive skies, their frozen rings wispy as laser halos. Massive shadows are cast by other celestial objects, presumably standing in the way of the sun. The images are also enlarged to the point where the resolution meets its limit: In Mr. Ruff's depiction, the planet crumbles pixel by pixel into the black void of the galaxy.
His other new series, "zycles," is based on 19th-century engravings of electromagnetic waves. Mr. Ruff translated these images via a 3D computer-modeling program, but instead of his usual flattening, gives volume to 2D. The results are large, inkjet prints on canvas of colored lines and swirls with Jackson Pollock-like depth. The lines resemble traffic patterns or '80s screensavers, coursing with energy. More than any of Mr. Ruff's previous work, zycles is extreme in presenting images without context or guidance, but ones for which viewers have no preconceived notions at all.
Also on show are Mr. Ruff's earlier series, including the eerie-homey '70s interiors, night-vision shots of Düsseldorf, the architecture of Herzog & de Meuron, portraits and composite police mugs, newspaper images and stereo photos. Mr. Ruff's approach may seem heavy-handed and serious, but the way he tromps through these genres -- lightly, almost wantonly -- makes his way of seeing a joy.

Why I Defend Goat Sacrifice
Some people just give me a funny look and say nothing. Others say, "Goat sacrifice?," laugh nervously, and look for the nearest exit. Only the most forthright ask me directly: Why in the world would I go to court to defend my client José Merced's religious practice of killing goats in his home in the Dallas suburbs? I then explain, often to dubious ears, that Mr. Merced is a priest of the Santería religion and must sacrifice goats in order to ordain new priests. Without goat sacrifice, his religion would die out. Sometimes my questioners nod in agreement, sometimes they don't.
One reaction I haven't heard yet is "Oh, of course. What a great idea!" Yet that's what anyone who takes religious liberty seriously should say.
The simple fact is that freedom of religion doesn't mean much if it protects only those beliefs that the government, or the general populace, decides it likes. It is first and foremost unpopular beliefs that need the protections afforded by the First Amendment and international human rights treaties like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
No student of history could disagree. A constant in world history has been the marriage of despotism and the suppression of conscience. Pharaoh forbade the Jews to worship God in their own way. Socrates was executed for supposedly not believing in Athens' gods. The Romans called Christians "atheists" and threw them to the lions for failing to worship Caesar. Heretics of one sort or the other--including agnostics and atheists--were executed during Europe's religious wars. Hitler killed Jews as well as ministers like Dietrich Bonhoeffer who rejected his crimes against humanity. Stalin persecuted Jews, Orthodox Christians, Muslims, and many others. Mao closed almost every house of worship in China.
Freedom of religion is no less endangered today. In China, for example, Tibetan Buddhists, Muslim Uighurs, and Christian house churches have all had their right to assemble and worship taken away by government officials. In the former Soviet republics, governments require churches, synagogues, and mosques to get permits that are rarely forthcoming. And in countries like North Korea and Saudi Arabia, freedom of conscience simply does not exist. My colleagues at the Becket Fund are kept very busy by threats to religious freedom overseas.


Sectarian Gap Looms in Iraq Election
BAGHDAD -- Iraq's politicians are furiously angling for position ahead of parliamentary elections that could redefine the country's sectarian-based political landscape.
Across Baghdad, Iraqi politicians and party bosses have been shuttling between party headquarters, parliamentary backrooms and heavily fortified residential villas to explore and seal alliances ahead of the January vote.
Politicians and others involved in the deal-making say they are wrestling with a question that could affect Iraq for years to come: Are they more likely to win by playing sectarian politics, as in the past, or by forming coalitions that reach across ethnic and sectarian divides?
"We have a window of opportunity over the next few months to cross the religious-sectarian boundary in our politics," says former national-security adviser Mouafaq al-Rubaie, who will be competing for parliament as head of his own newly formed political party.
The success of nonsectarian parties in provincial elections earlier this year suggested to many that the era of sectarian politics in Iraq may be fading.


Don't Count on Syria's Support for Mideast Peace
One must be vexed, if not thoroughly dismayed, by the peculiar fantasy laid out by Edward P. Djerejian in "Damascus and the Road to Mideast Peace" (op-ed, Aug. 11). In addition to the fact that it has been 18 years since he served as U.S. ambassador to Syria, his article also omits many crucial facts regarding Syria's situation. It is a bankrupt nation under a savage dictatorship. Syria's farmers lack water because of a decade's worth of misconceived and badly guided agricultural policies; wells are running dry and basic grains and food must be imported. The peasants suffer from dust bowl conditions and are fleeing from rural lands to shanty towns in the cities.
Desperate clients in the European Union and Iran give financial support to the regime, leading Syria to import arms and fuel, and export terror. Yet Syrian President Bashar Assad pretends to make demands on Israel for his father's lost wars of aggression. Talk about Potemkin-village-like façades! Only Russia's is (barely) viable today.

U.S. Leans on War-Zone Contractors
(Please see Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
Even as U.S. troops surge to new highs in Afghanistan they are outnumbered by military contractors working alongside them, according to a Defense Department census due to be distributed to Congress -- illustrating how hard it is for the U.S. to wean itself from the large numbers of war-zone contractors that proved controversial in Iraq.
The number of military contractors in Afghanistan rose to almost 74,000 by June 30, far outnumbering the roughly 58,000 U.S. soldiers on the ground at that point. As the military force in Afghanistan grows further, to a planned 68,000 by the end of the year, the Defense Department expects the ranks of contractors to increase more.
The military requires contractors for essential functions ranging from supplying food and laundry services to guarding convoys and even military bases -- functions that were once performed by military personnel but have been outsourced so a slimmed-down military can focus more on battle-related tasks.
The Obama administration has sought to reduce its reliance on military contractors, worried that the Pentagon was ceding too much power to outside companies, failing to rein in costs and not achieving desired results.


Notable & Quotable
Edward Kennedy was once the handsomest of the handsome Kennedy boys, with a proudly jutting chin, a Nelson Eddy jaw and Cupid's-bow lips under a thatch of chestnut hair. When he is dieting and on the wagon, there is a glimpse of that still, which makes it all the harder to see him as he more often is. There is a great desire to remember him as we remember his brothers. The Dorian Grays of Hyannis Port, John and Robert, have perpetual youth and beauty and style, and their faces are mirrors of all that is better and classier and richer than us. Ted is the reality, the 57-year-old living picture of a man who has feasted on too much for too long with too little restraint, the visible proof that nothing exceeds like excess. . . .
Kennedy is strong and unswerving in his beliefs because they are personal, rooted not in theory but in an emotional commitment to government activism—a continuation and expansion of the leftward direction in which his brother Robert had been heading before his murder. Milton Gwirtzman, who wrote speeches for both Bobby and Ted, says the latter does not have "an articulated set of principles" that rises to the level of an ideology. "There's no such thing as 'Kennedy's thoughts,' " says Gwirtzman. "It's reactions, gut instincts. And they've been bent occasionally, but they have always remained the same."


Japan Jobless Rate Surges Before Vote
TOKYO -- Japan's jobless rate reached a new high in July, in another blow to the ruling party's chances of maintaining its 54-year grip on power in Sunday's general election.
In a last-ditch effort to salvage the hopes of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is trailing in opinion polls, Prime Minister Taro Aso crisscrossed the country on Friday, trying to slow the momentum of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan.
Speaking in the southern Kyushu region, Mr. Aso implored voters to give his party more time to prove that the economy is on track for recovery, and questioned the DPJ's credentials to lead.
"There are signs of a recovery, but we are still only halfway done," said Mr. Aso, who was scheduled to make seven campaign stops Friday and attend eight more rallies Saturday. "Some people seem to be looking for a big change, but politics is not something to gamble with."
The DPJ dispatched its leader -- Yukio Hatoyama, expected to become Japan's next prime minister should the DPJ win -- to Kyushu and Shikoku, another southern region, where the contests for seats in the lower house of parliament are still close.


U.K. Denies a Role in Lockerbie Release
Fallout from the convicted Lockerbie bomber's release reverberated throughout the U.K. on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Gordon Brown denied that his government conspired to force the decision, and Scotland's parliament rebuked the justice minister who made it.
Early in the day, Britain's foreign minister, David Miliband, confirmed that the U.K. had been willing to see the bomber let out of prison, as revealed in a memo that fanned controversy on Tuesday. "We did not want him to die in prison," Mr. Miliband said in a BBC radio interview.
Mr. Brown said on Wednesday there had been no deal between the U.K. and the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, on the release last month of Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the Libyan convicted of the 1988 bombing of a U.S. jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
Since the Scottish authorities' controversial decision, Mr. Brown has faced speculation that the U.K. pressed for his release to facilitate British oil interests in Libya. "On our part, there was no conspiracy, no coverup, no double-dealing, no deal on oil, no attempt to instruct Scottish ministers, no private assurances by me to Colonel Gadhafi," Mr. Brown said at an employment conference in Birmingham. "We made absolutely clear to the Libyans and everybody else that this was a decision for the Scottish government."
Scottish officials said they decided, without outside influence, to allow Mr. al-Megrahi -- diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer -- to return to Libya on "compassionate grounds."


A Doctor's Plan for Legal Industry Reform
Since we are moving toward socialism with ObamaCare, the time has come to do the same with other professions—especially lawyers. Physician committees can decide whether lawyers are necessary in any given situation.
At a town-hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., last month, our uninformed lawyer in chief suggested that we physicians would rather chop off a foot than manage diabetes since we would make more money doing surgery. Then President Obama compounded his attack by claiming a doctor's reimbursement is between "$30,000" and "$50,000" for such amputations! (Actually, such surgery costs only about $1,500.)
Physicians have never been so insulted. Because of these affronts, I will gladly volunteer for the important duty of controlling and regulating lawyers. Since most of what lawyers do is repetitive boilerplate or pushing paper, physicians would have no problem dictating what is appropriate for attorneys. We physicians know much more about legal practice than lawyers do about medicine.
Following are highlights of a proposed bill authorizing the dismantling of the current framework of law practice and instituting socialized legal care:


TiVo Stands to Get $200 Million
TiVo Inc. won a court order in a dispute over technology that the judge estimates will result in about $200 million in damage payments from Dish Network Corp. and EchoStar Corp.
The sanctions, however, will be paid only if Dish and EchoStar lose their appeal of the initial ruling. TiVo originally sought $1 billion as part of a long-running drama over technology that allows consumers to pause, rewind and fast-forward live television.
"We are pleased by the Court's ruling to impose contempt sanctions of approximately $200 million against EchoStar for its continued violation of a Court-ordered permanent injunction," TiVo said in a statement.
Dish and EchoStar, which are sister companies, remain optimistic about the appeals process.
"While we disagree that any amount of sanctions was warranted, the decision confirms our belief that we designed around Tivo's patent in good faith. We believe that we ultimately will prevail on appeal," the companies said in a joint statement.


Fairfield Settles Madoff-Linked Charges
Fairfield Greenwich Group, considered to be the largest feeder of investors to Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, agreed to pay $8 million to settle civil fraud charges filed by Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin.
Mr. Galvin said it was the first restitution of funds to Fairfield clients whose assets were funneled to Mr. Madoff's firm. The $8 million, less $500,000 paid to the state, will be shared among an estimated 15 Massachusetts investors who lost money in the scheme -- the only ones, Mr. Galvin said, that the state has been able to identify as Madoff victims who invested through Fairfield.
Fairfield Greenwich neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement. In a statement, the firm said it settled to "avoid drawn-out hearings and significant legal bills" and is in discussions to settle claims "involving many more investors." Fairfield executives had been scheduled to appear for hearings with Massachusetts regulators on Wednesday.
Fairfield had $6.9 billion of its $14 billion in client assets invested with Mr. Madoff, according to a statement on its Web site. It is facing a claim for $3.3 billion brought by a U.S. bankruptcy trustee in New York on behalf of Mr. Madoff's defunct firm, and is also defending itself in a lawsuit brought by investors in U.S. District Court in New York.
Mr. Galvin said the Massachusetts investors who are part of Tuesday's settlement will get "all their money back, plus interest." A settlement document said investors would receive their invested sums, less any redemptions, plus 6% annual interest.


Kashmir Car Bomb Kills Four
SRINAGAR, India -- At least four people were killed late Saturday in a powerful car bomb blast set off by Islamic militants near the main jail in Indian Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar, police said.
"So far we have three policemen and a woman dead and 15 others injured," police spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi told AFP.
He described the explosion as "powerful" and said it was an attack by Islamic militants fighting Indian rule.
"The militants had planted an Improvised Explosive Device inside an abandoned car and triggered the blast by using a remote control device," Mr. Tripathi said.
The rebels targeted a police bus that was returning to another town after dropping some of the convicts at the jail.


Representation Without Taxation
In his Sept. 8 letter supporting Daniel Henninger's column ("The Revolt of the Masses," Sept. 3), Craig Heiser opines that we now have "representation without representation." A far greater problem is that we increasingly have representation without taxation. Too many people are now eligible to vote who pay little or no income tax, and may also be the recipients of generous tax credits. Others have aptly noted the perils of such a "tipping point" where a majority of citizens would have little interest in the efficiency and fiscal probity of our government, but only an interest in the benefits that could be extracted from it.

The War on Terror Goes On
It's been a good few weeks in what used to be called the war on terror. The main credit here goes to the folks in the intelligence community that our friends on the left love to hate.
Credit goes as well to Barack Obama, who as President has abandoned much of his previous opposition to proven antiterror measures like warrantless wiretaps, and who has only stepped up the campaign of targeted hits on terrorist ringleaders. He's fortunate the Bush Administration left him with a potent intelligence team and the precedent of taking the fight, pre-emptively, to the terrorists on their home turf.
On Monday, U.S. special forces operating in Somalia killed top al Qaeda operative Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, believed to have been a planner in the November 2002 bombing of a hotel in Kenya in which 15 were killed. Also killed in recent days was senior al Qaeda leader Ilyas Kashmiri—via a U.S. drone attack in western Pakistan—and Indonesian terrorist mastermind Noordin Muhammad Top, suspected in the July bombing of two Jakarta hotels.
Last week, too, a British court convicted three men for an August 2006 plot to blow up several airliners over the Atlantic. The convictions were obtained largely on the strength of communications intercepts—possibly warrantless—gathered by the U.S. National Security Agency, according to a report by Britain's Channel 4.


Notable & Quotable
In Afghanistan, security is the principal concern, although there are numerous other challenges as well, with governmental legitimacy prominent among them. Clearly, the security trend in Afghanistan has been a downward spiral, with levels of violence at record highs in recent weeks.
At a time when the challenges loom so large, it is important to remember why we are there. That is to ensure that al-Qaeda and other transnational extremist groups are not able to re-establish sanctuaries in Afghanistan like those they had during Taliban rule there before 9/11.
General Stan McChrystal, the Commander of Nato's International Security Assistance Force, who has spent most of his career since 9/11 leading the U.S.'s most elite counterterrorist element, the Joint Special Operations Command, is employing a comprehensive, counterinsurgency campaign. He is the first to recognize not just the extraordinary capabilities but also the limitations of counterterrorism forces in Afghanistan.


SEC Plan for Reserve Primary Opposed
The top securities regulator in Massachusetts is opposing a Securities and Exchange Commission proposal for distributing the remaining assets in the Reserve Primary Fund, the money-market fund that struggled with investment losses and panicked selling after Lehman Brothers' collapse a year ago.
As part of a civil lawsuit against the Reserve's founders, the SEC has recommended that a court monitor who would distribute the remaining assets of the fund be allowed to "claw back" assets from some investors who managed to get their money out of the $62 billion fund before Reserve stopped allowing withdrawals. Massachusetts sent a letter Monday to the judge hearing the case arguing that a claw back would be unfair to the investors who managed to get funds out.
The SEC's proposal, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, would allow the monitor to go after investors who sold their Reserve Fund shares at $1 per share in the hours just before the fund "broke the buck" -- meaning its net asset fell below $1-and froze redemptions on Sept. 15, 2008. Under the SEC's proposal, the clawed-back assets would be put into the pot of money that will be used to pay all Reserve Fund investors.
In the letter, the office of Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said the provision risks penalizing innocent investors who received $10.7 billion from the Reserve Fund on Sept. 15 in the "absence of any wrongdoing on their part." About 2,000 Massachusetts investors had nearly $2.2 billion in the fund at the time, the letter said.
The letter from Massachusetts says a resolution "where only investors suffer the harm, is so far from equitable that it should shock the conscience."


The Lisbon Treaty, cont.
We will be excerpting the Lisbon Treaty on these pages in the days leading up to the Irish referendum on Oct. 2. Below is from Title VII, the "Solidarity Clause":
ARTICLE 188 R
1. The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster. The Union shall mobilize all the instruments at its disposal, including the military resources made available by the Member States, to:
(a)– prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States;
– protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack.


Dodd Presses Single Bank Regulator
WASHINGTON -- Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd pressed his case Tuesday for creating a single regulator to oversee U.S. banks.
In prepared remarks at a Senate hearing, Mr. Dodd argued a single bank regulator would eliminate the redundancies created by multiple bank supervisors as well as end the "pass-the-buck excuses" he said policy makers have been hearing from regulators since the outbreak of the financial crisis.
And he suggested he wouldn't be daunted by warnings that radically streamlining regulation would be too politically difficult to achieve.
"That argument doesn't work terribly well with me" or other members of the panel, Mr. Dodd said. However, he later remarked that community banks presented "the most contentious political problem" for creating the new agency.
Mr. Dodd drew strong support for his approach from witnesses testifying before the panel.


Neocon Iraq Policy Has Been Costly
Regarding Bret Stephens's "The Neocons Make a Comeback" (Global View, Sept. 29): Nothing says more about the failure of the neoconservative-inspired foreign policy of George W. Bush than our current standoff with Iran.
By crippling the Sunni-dominated Iraqi dictatorship as a regional power, rather than pursuing the more limited goals of containing its political and military influence, the U.S. removed the one tried and true counterbalance to the Shiite-fascist Iranian dictatorship. Iran has benefited greatly by our having forcefully removed, at considerable cost, a natural enemy, Sunni Baathist Iraq, with which it fought a costly eight-year war in the 1980s.
Now that it is generally accepted throughout the world that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was based on erroneous intelligence information, key potential allies in our efforts to challenge Iran, such as China, have an excuse to be skeptical about the application of "crippling sanctions." Ironically, Israel is now at greater risk than at any time in its 61-year history.
To make matters worse, the diversion of precious military resources to Iraq has enabled a Taliban comeback in Afghanistan and in the Pakistan frontier at a time when the American public has little appetite for escalating the battle.

Chinese Minorities Embrace Roots
QAPQAL, China -- Hasutai gingerly turns on the tape recorder and places it on a table. Out of it emanates something he thought he'd never hear: his native tongue, Manchu, spoken by a living person.
Hasutai is a Manchu, descendant of a nomadic warrior tribe that conquered China in the 17th century and ruled it for more than 250 years. Generations of persecution have all but eliminated the Manchus' language.
So Hasutai, who in the Manchu tradition goes by the one name, has come to this remote corner of China on a quest. His goal is to connect with members of the Xibe tribe -- a reclusive group who speak a forgotten dialect similar to his people's. Along with a band of like-minded young people in half a dozen Chinese cities, Hasutai has started schools, Web sites, written textbooks and recorded the few remaining Manchu speakers for posterity. "At some point you realize that the first language you're speaking isn't your mother tongue," says Hasutai. "You feel like an orphan. You want to find your mother."
Hasutai is at the vanguard of an explosion of ethnic awareness and pride across China. The nation's 1.3 billion people are overwhelmingly Han Chinese, but roughly 9% of the population are ethnic minorities: Manchus and Mongolians, Uighurs and Tibetans as well as dozens of others. Although their numbers are small, minorities live on nearly half of China's territory, including most of its borderlands. Over the past two years they have been at the center of bloody riots that claimed hundreds of lives.
As China's Communist Party marks its 60th year this week with a series of festivities to symbolize national unity, Chinese society is struggling to overcome growing ethnic rifts.


We Are All Flying the Union Skies Now
There may well be a troubling distortion advanced by the White House concerning unionization procedure in the Delta Airlines case, as your editorial "Flying the Union Skies" (Oct. 7) describes. However, it may not really matter since we are already flying the union skies.
One of the great myths about the airline industry is that it's deregulated. It isn't. From labor law to antitrust, taxation, foreign ownership rules and federally controlled airports and airspace, the airline industry is utterly tied to government and unions, to the FAA's pursestrings handled by Congress and to aircraft manufactured by union labor and in many cases, subsidized by foreign governments.
Interestingly, the most consistently profitable and operationally efficient airline in the country is Southwest. It is also the most heavily unionized. It sports a rare credit balance sheet, low debt and for many years a growth-category common stock that has fared better than its peers. It would seem that labor can be pretty good at capitalism. Of course, Southwest also sports a different business model, which is more of a factor in its performance than the presence or absence of organized labor.
Delta's shareholders might be more concerned about the other labor group—management—and how they're running the company. In this category, the industry has a difficult track record as well.

Philip K. Howard: Why Medical Malpractice Is Off Limits
Almost all the other groups with a stake in health reform—including patient safety experts, physicians, the AARP, the Chamber of Commerce, schools of public health—support pilot projects such as special health courts that would move beyond today's hyper-adversarial malpractice lawsuit system to a court that would quickly and reliably distinguish between good and bad care. The support for some kind of reform reflects a growing awareness among these groups that managing health care sensibly, including containing costs, is almost impossible when doctors go through the day thinking about how to protect themselves from lawsuits.
The American public also favors legal overhaul. A recent Common Good/Committee for Economic Development poll found that 83% of Americans believe that "as part of any health care reform plan, Congress needs to change the medical malpractice system."
Congress now realizes it can't completely stonewall legal reform. But what has unfolded so far is a series of vague pronouncements and token proposals—all of which assiduously avoid any specific ideas that might offend the trial bar. Here are some examples:


Let a Hundred Publishers Bloom
On a freezing Beijing morning in early January 1937, with the Japanese Imperial Army poised to invade China, American journalist Helen Foster Snow stumbled across a horrible find under the city's ancient walls—the murdered, eviscerated body of 16-year-old English schoolgirl Pamela Werner. Down the street, Ms. Snow's husband, Edgar Snow, was writing his classic book, "Red Star Over China," a sympathetic account of Mao Zedong's guerilla army. Of similar height and build, Ms. Snow wondered: Had an anti-Communist killer meant to strike her?
Scotland Yard's suspects included an unknown psychopath; Ms. Werner's dentist, the American Dr. Prentice, who ran a swingers' club (a "love cult" in 1930s parlance) to which the schoolgirl belonged; and the victim's own father. The killer was never found.
This forgotten cause célèbre, a true crime tale authored by Shanghai-based entrepreneur Paul French, is the first book deal struck by Penguin China chief representative Jo Lusby for a new, exclusively China-originated list to be launched next year. Modeled on the launch 22 years ago of Penguin Books India, the five to eight fiction and nonfiction titles will be printed in English, in China, and sold domestically and across the Asia-Pacific region. The wholly owned venture will be run out of Penguin's Hong Kong office, as ISBN numbers are tightly controlled in mainland China.
Penguin wants to take advantage of signs of buoyancy and change in China's 6.5 billion yuan ($950 million) publishing market, long strangled by censorship and a bewildering mass of regulatory controls. Things gathered pace in April when Liu Binjie, minister of the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP), announced de facto legalization of the country's 10,000 private publishers.
The relief across the industry is palpable. "It's like this: If I had a girlfriend before, now I have a marriage certificate. She's my wife," joked He Xiongfei, founder of the private publisher Jewish Culture Workroom, which publishes a range of titles including books on art collecting, cannibalism and social commentary, as well as subjects of Jewish interest.


Tea-Party Activists Vex Republicans
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. -- The rise of conservative "tea party" activists around the country has created a dilemma for Republicans. They are breathing life into the party's quest to regain power. But they're also waging war on some candidates hand-picked by GOP leaders as the most likely to win.
In upstate New York, Dede Scozzafava, 49 years old, is the choice of local party leaders to defend a Republican seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, an abortion-rights candidate who could appeal to independents. Doug Hoffman, 59, is a local accountant backed by tea-party activists who has jumped into the race declaring himself the real conservative.
Mr. Hoffman has siphoned so much support from Ms. Scozzafava that their Democratic rival has vaulted into the lead, according to a poll released Thursday. The election is Nov. 3.
"I am not your run-of-the-mill politician, and maybe that's why the Republican bosses didn't like me," Mr. Hoffman told a recent health-care forum sponsored by the Upstate New York Tea Party. In an interview, Ms. Scozzafava acknowledged her discomfort at the event. "I knew it wasn't going to be an easy audience for me," she said.


There Is No New Frontier
Here are pertinent observations from two accomplished political veterans at a forum Tuesday night at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The question, from David Gergen, was what advice the panelists, former Reagan advisor Ken Duberstein and former JFK advisor Ted Sorensen, both of whom had been supportive of Mr. Obama in 2008—Mr. Sorensen campaigned with him in the primaries and the general election—would now give the president.
Mr. Duberstein said, "Don't overload the circuits," sequence your actions, don't attempt too much too quickly, or too completely. Then, modify the tone. "In campaigning, you try to annihilate your opponent. Governing, you try to make love to your opponents, as well as your allies."
Mr. Sorensen disagreed with the first point—he thought the circuit board was already overloaded when Mr. Obama was handed it last January—but not the second. On the issue of tone, he had told the Obama transition team, "Stop campaigning. You've been campaigning for years, and of course you've been in perpetual campaign mode, and [Bill] Clinton more than anyone else set that pattern of the permanent campaign. But once you're president you don't need to worry" about what's on the front page of the Washington Post or how some mayor reacts to some appointment. You've got to think bigger than that, more expansively.
Mr. Gergen: "Do you think [the president] is still campaigning too much?"
"Yes," said Mr. Sorensen. "I think that he's a remarkable speaker, but his speeches are still largely in campaign mode. I think he was surprised by the unanimity of the Republicans in Congress against his program, and probably feels he has to be in campaign mode," but "he's got a long time before he has to start his re-election campaign."


Why One Democrat Thinks New York Needs a Strong GOP
Last month, about 240,000 registered Democrats in New York City—myself included—voted in a runoff election for public advocate and comptroller, two of New York's three directly elected citywide offices. Facing only nominal Republican opposition in November, the winners of the runoff—John Liu in the comptroller race, and Bill de Blasio in the public advocate race—are essentially guaranteed victory in the general election. In other words, two of the top three municipal offices in the nation's largest city were chosen by 6% of the city's electorate. That isn't democracy. It's oligarchy. And it's not working.
It wasn't so long ago that we Democrats were celebrating our dominance. Last November, I joined hundreds of my fellow Democrats at an election night event hosted by the New York state Democratic Party. We celebrated the election of a Democratic president, a Democratic landslide in Congress, and with equal excitement the news that the New York state Senate, that last bastion of Republican control in our home state, had fallen into Democratic hands. For the first time since 1935, Democrats would control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature. 2009 was going to be a great year.
In June, the state Senate was thrown into disorder when two Democratic members—Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate—staged a parliamentary coup and attempted to reinstall the Republican leadership. Last month, New York's Democratic Gov. David Paterson lost the public support of our party's national-standard bearer, the president of the United States. Meanwhile, New Yorkers continue to pay among the highest taxes in the nation, footing the bill for the backdoor borrowing of the state's hundreds of barely regulated authorities, a bloated public workforce rife with redundancies, and of course, the salaries of indicted state legislators (including Sen. Monserrate, recently convicted of misdemeanor assault—and still collecting a paycheck).


Indian Voters Back Congress in State Polls
NEW DELHI -- Voters in three Indian states handed the ruling Indian National Congress party and its ally victory in state elections that were being viewed as an early referendum on the performance of the national government since it began a new term in June.
Elections were held Oct. 13 in the western state of Maharashtra, which includes the financial and media capital Mumbai; Haryana in the north; and Arunachal Pradesh in the east. In all, the eligible voters in the three states totaled about 90 million, who chose representatives from 5,000 candidates. Election officials reported 60% voter turnout for Maharashtra, 73% for Haryana and 71% for Arunachal Pradesh.
"The victory will boost the morale of the Congress party," said Sanjay Kumar, a fellow at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a New Delhi-based think-tank. It could also prompt the party to accelerate economic reforms that it has pursued since coming to power in 2004, he added.
The Congress party – which leads the national governing United Progressive Alliance coalition – gained a majority of the seats in Arunachal and is poised to secure another term in office in Maharashtra in an alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party, an offshoot. It also gained the most seats of any party in Haryana but still fell short of a majority. Congress had been in effective control of all three states prior to the election.
The polls dealt another blow to the beleaguered Bharatiya Janata Party, the main national opposition which lost seats in the national parliament elections earlier this year and has been struggling since to redefine itself in a way that appeals to voters. It fared poorly in all three states Thursday and officials acknowledged the disappointing results. "The party will have to strategize how to strengthen and win elections in other important states over the next two years," said Nalin Kohli, national media convener for the Hindu nationalist party in New Delhi.


Asean's 'Human-Rights' Council
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations inaugurated its human-rights commission Friday. Like its United Nations equivalent, it's a toothless body, but it can still do damage to the cause it's supposed to serve.
Asean members aspire for the council to be "a vehicle for progressive social development and justice, the full realization of human dignity and the attainment of a higher quality life for Asean peoples," according to their inaugural declaration. These are worthy goals.
But Asean is a broad church that includes countries like Burma and Laos that want to rubber-stamp their authoritarian regimes, not submit to real scrutiny. All 10 commissioners who will serve on the council for three year terms were chosen by their respective Asean member nations, in most cases through opaque selection processes that involved little or no public consultation. Commissioners include Kyaw Tint Swe, the Burmese ambassador to the U.N. who has long defended the junta's rights record there, and Brunei's Abdul Hamid Bakal, a Shariah court judge. The commission operates by consensus and its mandate focuses on promoting human rights, not protecting them.
The initial signals aren't encouraging. At the weekend Asean summit in Hua Hin, Thailand, delegates discussed regional integration, climate change and removing trade barriers. No less than five Asean nations—Burma, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and Singapore—refused to meet with civil society representatives during a scheduled "interface meeting" Friday meant to act as a forum for discussion between heads of state and civil society representatives.
This was nothing if not predictable, given the composition of the council. It's also a shame, given the need for an effective human-rights watchdog in the region. Burma, for instance, will be holding elections next year. If the human-rights council meant what it said about upholding "human dignity," it could mention the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi, the jailed opposition leader who is still under house arrest. Or it could examine the status of the Rohingya refugees who routinely wash up on the shores of Thailand and Malaysia as they flee from Burma.


'Man Up, Obama' and Other Nonsense
Earlier this month, New York Times "visual op-ed columnist" Charles M. Blow blasted Barack Obama for his refusal to stand "up for his convictions." The thrust of the article—an unoriginal idea if there ever was one—was that the president needs to heed those who "worked tirelessly" to get him elected and institute the reforms they were counting on. Ram through that public option. Clean up the mess in Iraq. Extricate us from the "quagmire" in Afghanistan. Rebuild New Orleans. Reform Wall Street. God almighty, you've been in office almost 10 months now. What's the hold-up?
I for one am sick of reading the "Man Up, Barack" editorial, which is then regurgitated by friends and neighbors as if they were the sole authors of this retread banality. Invariably, the person suggesting that Mr. Obama man up thinks of himself as a tough-as-nails hombre. In reality, they are usually the kinds of people who send their kids to Oberlin College, swoon over Andrea Bocelli, and think Jimmy Carter was a macho man. Teamsters they are not.
Barack Obama, raised by a single mother and his grandparents, born with no discernible financial advantages, clocked Hillary Clinton, clocked John McCain, and got himself elected the first African-American president of the United States. He got himself elected in a country that was still lynching black people when he was a child. Barack Obama, whatever you may think of his politics, doesn't need anyone telling him to man up. Especially visual op-ed columnists.


U.S. Should Sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
Sen. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) is dead wrong on nuclear testing ("Why We Need to Test Nuclear Weapons," op-ed, Oct. 21). The U.S. has already tested nuclear weapons more than 1,050 times, far more than any other country. We continue to conduct computer simulations and other types of tests. We can compare the information from these tests with the data from our earlier explosive tests.

The Fingernator
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger still knows how to get his message across in dramatic fashion. In a memo to Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano explaining why he was vetoing a bill by the San Francisco assemblyman, the governor spelled out "f--- you" using the first letter of each line along the left margin.
The governor's spokesman Aaron McLear maintains that the hidden suggestion was just "a weird coincidence." He noted that other veto messages had spelled out "poet" and "soap." But the coincidence seems especially unlikely given a certain history between the assemblyman and governor.
Earlier this month, the GOP governor showed up to speak at a Democratic Party fundraiser at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Though the governor had been invited by the organizers, many Democrats in the room thought he was crashing their event. When former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown introduced Governor Schwarzenegger, Mr. Ammiano shouted out "You lie!" in a copy-cat of Rep. Joe Wilson's remarks during President Obama's September congressional address. Afterwards, Mr. Ammiano walked out muttering that the governor could "kiss my gay ass."
It looks like the governor is getting the last laugh. Four days after the fundraiser, he vetoed Mr. Ammiano's bill to expand the finance powers of the Port of San Francisco even though the bill had cleared the Senate 40-0 and the Assembly 78-0.


Deal Reached on Journalist Shield Law
WASHINGTON – The White House reached a compromise with lawmakers Friday on legislation aimed at protecting journalists in some circumstances from being ordered to disclose their confidential sources.
Democratic Sens. Charles Schumer of New York and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, sponsors of the legislation, said the compromise includes new provisions designed to further protect national security interests, which had been a concern for the Obama administration.
Mr. Specter said the bill is "a major improvement over current procedures where journalists have been threatened, fined and jailed for appropriately protecting sources."
White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said the Obama administration is the first in history to support media-shield legislation. "We expect this proposal to move forward with bipartisan support, and the president looks forward to signing it into law," Mr. LaBolt said.
Under the bill, a reporter wouldn't be protected from disclosing confidential sources when the information would help the government prevent or mitigate an act of terrorism or other actions that would significantly harm national security.


Rove: Tuesday's Suburban Vote Swing
Tuesday's elections should put a scare into red state Democrats—and a few blue state ones, too.
The trend here is that suburban and independent voters moved into the GOP column. The overall shift away from Democrats was 13 points in Virginia, 12 points in New Jersey, and eight points in Pennsylvania.
Even a five-point swing in 2010 could bring a tidal wave of change. Today, Democrats enjoy 60 votes in the Senate, Republicans a mere 40. Had there been a five-point swing away from Democrats last fall, the party would have started this year with 54 seats and the Republicans 46.


Notable & Quotable
Former Czech President Vaclav Havel, speaking to the European Parliament on November 11, 2009:
It has long been my opinion that after what we underwent at the time of the totalitarian system, we ought—or we are duty-bound even—to explain to others in a convincing manner what we went through, and make specific suggestions based on its various implications..It should be the way we can help guarantee that what we endured will never be repeated. What does it require?
Above all, clear and unequivocal solidarity with all those confronted by totalitarian or authoritarian regimes wherever they are in the world. And economic or other particular interests should not hinder such solidarity. Even a minor, discreet and well-intentioned compromise can have fatal consequences—even if only in the long term, or indirectly. One must not retreat in the face of evil, because it is in the nature of evil to take advantage of every concession. Besides, Europe has already had its own unfortunate experience of appeasement policies. Our support can help open-minded people or outspoken witnesses to the situation in North Korea, Burma, Iran, Tibet, Belarus, Cuba or anywhere else, much more than we think. But it will help us too. It will help us build a better world and also to be more true to ourselves; in other words, to put into practice the values that we proclaim in general terms.
Recently the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Memorial, the Russian association that monitors how human rights are respected in Russia. I think that was an important act. I recall how important it once was in my country when the French President invited us—the opposition—to a working breakfast during his state visit—against the wishes of the state leadership. These are only seemingly superficial matters. That is how things operate in totalitarian regimes: a single breakfast or a single suppressed student demonstration can—in certain circumstances—set history moving.


Google and the Copyright Wars
The class action suit, brought in 2005, challenged Google's unauthorized scanning of copyrighted works to create a vast searchable database of books. It raised a critical question: Are search engines allowed, under the legal doctrine of "fair use," to make and store full copies of texts to power their search functions, profit from this material, and at the same time demand that copyright holders opt out if they don't want to be google-able?
The answer has importance far beyond the book-scanning project—it involves the very legality of how search engines operate on the Internet. If search engines cannot make full copies of books and Web sites without permission from copyright holders, their own business model would be jeopardized. When leading publishers and authors sued Google for violations of copyright, it appeared that the first serious test case was at hand.
And yet, as the litigation proceeded, the question that prompted the lawsuit—whether search engines are fair users—fell away entirely. The settlement agreement doesn't even address fair use standards for the future. Instead, the focus is now on the competitive concerns of allowing one company to have such a dominant role in digital book publishing, specifically on the treatment of "orphan works" (texts whose authors cannot be found).
Search engine caching—the process through which automated crawlers travel across the Internet, sweep up the contents of Web sites, and index them into searchable databases—is so fundamental to how information is distributed today that it's too big for any one case. It's a policy question that Congress has to tackle to give copyright owners a fair share of the revenue that their content generates on the Web.


Thailand's Abhisit: Early Poll Likely
SINGAPORE - Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Saturday that he will likely call early elections after the economy has firmly recovered.
"The likelihood is that there will be early elections once the economy is firmly grounded," Mr. Abhisit told Dow Jones Newswires. "The early poll could be called any time," he said, declining to specify a timeframe.
Calling early polls would help legitimize the rule of Mr. Abhisit, who was selected by Thailand's Parliament late last year after top army leaders helped broker the formation of a new coalition government. If Mr. Abhisit's Democrat Party and its coalition allies secure a majority in parliament, it could help turn down the heat on years of turmoil in the country, which is badly split between supporters and critics of former prime minister and telecommunications magnate, Thaksin Shinawatra.
Since being ousted in a military coup in 2006, Mr. Thaksin has continued to rally his supporters from overseas, where he is evading imprisonment on a conflict of interest conviction -- an allegation he denies.
Last week, he visited neighboring Cambodia, and dozens of supporters crossed the border to meet with him. Relations between historic rivals Thailand and Cambodia further soured when Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen appointed Mr. Thaksin as his economic adviser, and the two countries have recalled their ambassadors over the incident. Mr. Thaksin left Cambodia Saturday aboard his private jet.


Honduran Leader to Briefly Step Down
Honduras' interim president Roberto Micheletti will step down temporarily from his post for a week during the country's coming national elections, the Wall Street Journal has learned.
The move, while largely symbolic, is an effort by the interim government to boost international legitimacy for the Nov. 29 vote, which the government hopes will put an end to a political crisis that began with the June 28 ouster of President Manuel Zelaya.
In a speech to be delivered late on Thursday, Mr. Micheletti is expected to say he will hand the reins of government to his council of ministers – basically, the cabinet – from Nov. 24 until his return to power on Dec. 2, according to a copy of a speech obtained by the Wall Street Journal. The president-elect is scheduled to take power in January.
In the remarks, Mr. Micheletti says his temporary absence from his post is meant to help Hondurans concentrate on the presidential elections instead of the political crisis, which erupted when the army kicked the president out of the country for allegedly wanting to extend his stay in power. Mr. Zelaya, a close ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, denies the charges, and has called on Hondurans to boycott the vote.
"It's symbolic, but the fact that Micheletti won't be presiding over the government when elections take place will help to some extent to help get other governments to come around to recognize the election," said Michael Shifter, an analyst at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank.


China's Currency Manipulation Threatens Prosperity
The American people, starting with pundits like Robert Reich ("China and the American Jobs Machines," op-ed, Nov. 17), urgently need to understand one simple fact: The high savings rates observed in Asia are not due to inherent frugality, the lack of a social safety net, or, as Mr. Reich would now have us believe with respect to China, because China is "oriented to production, not consumption." This obscures the fact that it is China's currency manipulation that is the single most important driving force behind high Asian "savings."
Someday, both the left and right in America (as well as the White House) will figure out that China's currency manipulation is the root of the global trade imbalance problem that threatens long-term prosperity and they will get on the trade reform bandwagon—now gathering dust at the Department of Commerce.

Europe Doesn't Agree on Marijuana
Europe has yet to come up with a unified approach to medical marijuana. The Dutch will tell you it is legal to use the drug to treat certain illnesses; while the Swedish don't recognize any medical use for cannabis at all.
"European policy is not really changing at all and I don't think this issue is even on the European agenda. The topic is too controversial and too political," said Catherine Sandvos, a legal expert for the Hague-based Cannabis Bureau, a Dutch national agency aimed at providing high-quality cannabis for medical purposes.
Ms. Sandvos's native Netherlands has led Europe when it comes to legalizing medical marijuana, which it treats separately from marijuana legally available at one of Amsterdam's famous coffee shops. The Dutch police stopped enforcing laws against marijuana in 1976 following an overall tolerance policy in the country. "It's hard when you try to explain to outsiders that it is illegal to grow cannabis in the Netherlands, but that it is tolerated to buy it," she says.
But those who buy the drug on the streets are not getting the quality severely ill patients would need. The Dutch government set up the Cannabis Bureau -- the only institution of its kind in the continent -- in September 2003.
"The state realized that so many people wanted to use cannabis, so it said 'why not give it to them via prescription instead of them accessing the drug illegally,' " Ms. Sandvos added.


Property Owners Get Dunked On
New York judges served up what basketball fans call a facial on Tuesday, when an appellate court ruled that the state may seize homes and small businesses in Brooklyn for the benefit of a private developer and the New Jersey Nets. The decision represents a backward step for the effort to protect property rights at the state level since the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Kelo v. New London.
The case, Goldstein v. New York State Urban Development Corporation, dealt with plans by developer Forest City Ratner to build a new arena for the Nets as well as snazzy apartments and offices on land currently occupied by homes and businesses. To make way for the sports complex, the state declared the property "blighted" and used its power of eminent domain to hand it to the developer.
Such unabashed takings have an unfortunate history in New York state, where the political class has a habit of using its powers on behalf of well-connected private interests. Caught under the wheels are average citizens whose only recourse is to try to defend their property rights in court.
So much for that. In allowing the property seizure, the Court of Appeals dodged some of the central challenges to the condemnation, including whether the Empire State Development Corporation's designation of blight in the Atlantic Yards area was applied after the stadium project had already been planned, making it a "pretext." Nor did the court take on the question—at the heart of eminent domain law since Kelo—whether economic development may be considered a public use under the New York Constitution.
Instead, the majority argued that because the state had designated the area as blighted, the takings were therefore a "public use," and it was not the place of the court to interfere. Nevermind that the determination of blight was based largely on a study funded by . . . the aspiring developer.


The Fate of Liu Xiaobo
Next week marks two anniversaries for China: one year since dissident Liu Xiaobo disappeared into the maw of the state-security apparatus, and one year since the manifesto for political reform he helped draft, Charter 08, was made public. As the country's human-rights situation continues to deteriorate, the world must not forget Mr. Liu and the sacrifices he has made for China's political modernization.
The 53-year-old literature professor was formally arrested by police in June and accused of "agitation" and "subversion." His real crime was to give lie to the idea that the Chinese people are unconcerned by the authoritarian nature of their government. Since it was unveiled, Charter 08 has garnered thousands of signatures of Chinese from all walks of life. That's despite the fact that signatories knew at the very least they would be harassed by the authorities; some were detained during President Obama's recent visit.
These citizens took great personal risks simply to ask the government to live up to ideals enshrined in its own constitution, ideals that have never been put into practice. These include civil liberties such as freedom of expression and equal protection under the law. The charter also calls for democratic elections to form a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people."
President Obama reportedly raised Mr. Liu's case in private talks with China's leaders this month. But so far that seems to have had little effect; his detention without trial was recently extended for another two months. Defense lawyer Mo Shaoping has been prevented from formally taking the case, on the grounds that he is also a signatory to Charter 08.
Maximum pressure from all quarters is needed for Mr. Liu's release, because once an indictment is issued there is little chance that he will escape a long prison sentence. Mr. Liu and Charter 08 are important symbols of the Chinese people's yearning for political reform to accompany decades of successful economic reforms. It is critical that he not suffer the fate of his predecessors, many of whom vanished into the prison system and then were forced abroad into exile.


ObamaCare Keeps Falling in the Polls
The Senate's compromise bill on health care was announced on Wednesday to much fanfare. But there's not much there for moderate Democrats to write home about. It waters down a provision creating a "public option," but it also expands (to include people over 55) Medicare, a program already expected to go bankrupt in 2017.
The Senate bill is so unwieldy that the health-care system it will create will almost certainly break apart and force us into Canadian-style care. As Rep. Anthony Weiner (D., N.Y.) said in a statement, the Medicare expansion "would perhaps get us on the path to a single payer model." That grim prospect means there's still a chance to defeat or reshape the health-reform effort.
Opponents of ObamaCare will be aided by polls showing that it is even less popular than HillaryCare was a year into the Clinton presidency. Back in December 1993, Gallup found that 47% of voters backed HillaryCare, with 32% opposed. Today, an average of health-care surveys at Pollster.com shows support for ObamaCare at 38.8%, with 51.4% against.
But the falling poll numbers tell us anyone who tries to force a full health-care debate that pushes a vote past the holidays will not suffer politically. One reason the Democrats are frantic for a vote before Christmas is that they fear what will happen if senators have to go home and talk with constituents before voting.


How Facebook Is Making Friending Obsolete
Friending wasn't used as a verb until about five years ago, when social networks such as Friendster, MySpace and Facebook burst onto the scene.
Suddenly, our friends were something even better - an audience. If blogging felt like shouting into the void, posting updates on a social network felt more like an intimate conversation among friends at a pub.
Inevitably, as our list of friends grew to encompass acquaintances, friends of friends and the girl who sat behind us in seventh-grade homeroom, online friendships became devalued.
Suddenly, we knew as much about the lives of our distant acquaintances as we did about the lives of our intimates – what they'd had for dinner, how they felt about Tiger Woods and so on.
Enter Twitter with a solution: no friends, just followers. These one-way relationships were easier to manage – no more annoying decisions about whether to give your ex-boyfriend access to your photos, no more fussing over who could see your employment and contact information.


Change Nobody Believes In
And tidings of comfort and joy from Harry Reid too. The Senate Majority Leader has decided that the last few days before Christmas are the opportune moment for a narrow majority of Democrats to stuff ObamaCare through the Senate to meet an arbitrary White House deadline. Barring some extraordinary reversal, it now seems as if they have the 60 votes they need to jump off this cliff, with one-seventh of the economy in tow.
Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government, yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new "manager's amendment" that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations. Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what's in it, not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning. After procedural motions that allow for no amendments, the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24.
Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce.
The rushed, secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that "reform" has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state. An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it, as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week. The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open, and clean up the mess later.
***
• Health costs. From the outset, the White House's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses, and they're sticking to that story. "Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn't read the bills," Mr. Obama said over the weekend. This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it.


Europe's Israel Obsession
Baroness Catherine Ashton of Upholland (the European Union's new chief diplomat in the likely case you don't know her) isn't exactly what one would call "experienced." Perhaps to shed her much-deserved reputation as a foreign-policy novice, she used her maiden speech in the European Parliament to fuel the Continent's No. 1 international-affairs obsession: trashing the Jewish state.
"We're deeply concerned about daily living conditions of people in Gaza," she told law makers last week. "Israel should reopen the crossings without delay."
It's rather odd, to say the least, that no sooner had Israel left Gaza in 2005, than the same people who so anxiously had called for Israel to "end the occupation" wanted it back in the picture. Even though Hamas returned Israel's peace gesture with relentless rocket attacks, Israel is nevertheless expected to establish some sort of free-trade zone with the Islamists and open its borders again to Palestinian suicide bombers.
Egypt, the Palestinians' Arab brother nation, meanwhile, can quietly build a steel wall—yes, steel—at its Gaza border without having to fear negative Western press coverage, let alone the Baroness's wrath. She has only Israel in her crosshairs, even though Jerusalem is actually still providing a lifeline to the Palestinians.


Hit Men Kill Mexican Hero's Family
MEXICO CITY -- The brazen murder of several family members of a Mexican Naval hero threatens to start a dangerous new chapter in the country's drug war, in which cartels increasingly resort to terror tactics to try to force the government to back off.
More than a dozen hit men carrying AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles burst into a house in eastern Mexico around midnight Monday, gunning down several relatives of 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedet Angulo, the 30-year-old who was hailed as a national hero last week after being killed in a battle that left drug lord Arturo Beltrán Leyva dead.
Mr. Angulo's mother, aunt, a sister and a brother were killed in the attack Tuesday.
Another sister was badly wounded and remained in critical condition, according to Rafael González, the attorney general of Tabasco, the Gulf Coast state where the shootings took place. "We will not rest until we find those responsible for these killings," Mr. González said.
The shooting came just hours after the enlisted sailor was buried with a military honor guard for his role last week in a Navy Special Forces operation that killed Mr. Beltrán Leyva, the highest-profile drug lord taken down in Mexico since Osiel Cárdenas, former head of the Gulf Cartel, was arrested in 2003.


Rove: New Year's Resolutions for Washington
President Obama not only left Washington, D.C., for the holidays, but the lower 48 as well. So I thought I'd offer a few New Year's resolutions for him and others to come back to in the coming year.
First, to Mr. Obama's staff: The Norwegian Nobel Committee didn't want to wake the president to tell him about his prize earlier this year, but there shouldn't be any reluctance to reassure the nation after a terrorist attack. Also, why not resolve to have a few less "historic" moments? How many can one president really have, anyway? A little more grace toward his predecessor would help him, as would less TV time. He is wearing out his welcome and his speechwriters—judging by the quality of their work lately.
In 2010, Mr. Obama should work on his habit of leaving a room of people with deeply divided opinions thinking he agrees with all of them. That leads to disagreements over essential issues, like the meaning of his pledge to begin withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2011 and the nature of the new military mission there.
Finally, Mr. Obama should work on meaning what he says. He didn't last year with all those health-care deadlines and tough talk supporting the public option. Now Mr. Obama will pivot to jobs and deficit reduction. As he tries to do that, voters will wonder if it's just a ruse to save Democrats.
Vice President Joe Biden should resolve to speak publicly less. Every time he opens his mouth, the West Wing staff uses him to make the president look good by comparison.


Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini: Why Japan Needs a 'Hatobama'
Mr. Hatoyama's promises were ambitious, and sometimes even contradictory. Recognizing Japan's financial limitations, he and his party pledged to slash wasteful state spending. Yet he has also called for "an economy of the people" that includes considerable state subsidies, and his government put forward a record high initial budget request of 95 trillion yen.
The government has now moved ahead with a new bond issuance, with a promise to cap the new debt at about 44 trillion yen. Mr. Hatoyama has announced plans to halt the privatization of Japan Post bank, an enormous enterprise with more than $3 trillion in assets that helps finance state spending. And he has reiterated a pledge that Japan will reduce carbon emissions 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, a promise that will soon prove too costly to keep.
On foreign policy, the new prime minister has argued that the U.S.-Japan relationship should develop toward a partnership of equals. But despite some blunt warnings from Washington, DPJ officials have yet to resolve the standoff over the controversial relocation of a helicopter base and 8,000 Marines from Japan to Guam. This is a deal the U.S. believes it settled with the previous Japanese government in 2006.


British Hostage Freed in Iraq
BAGHDAD -- A British hostage held for over two years by militants was released safely in Baghdad and is now in the care of the British Embassy here.
Also in Iraq, staggered explosions Wednesday killed at least 26 people -- more than a dozen of them policemen -- and wounded an Iraqi provincial governor, officials said, in the worst violence in months to hit the western province that was formerly al-Qaida's top stronghold in Iraq.
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement in London that Peter Moore was released by his captors Wednesday morning and taken to Iraqi authorities.
"He is in good health, despite his many months of captivity. He is undergoing medical checks and he will be reunited with his family as soon as possible," Mr. Miliband said. "He is obviously -- to put it mildly -- delighted at his release."
A Shiite militant group called Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, is believed to have been behind the abduction of five people, including Mr. Moore, from Iraq's finance ministry in 2007.


Taxpayers Fleeced to Enrich Union
The surreptitious union takeover of the private day-care industry in Michigan, acting in cahoots with Michigan's Department of Human Services, seems to be a simple case of money laundering, at least in spirit, if not in technical terms (Cross Country: "Michigan Forces Business Owners Into Public Sector Unions" by Patrick J. Wright and Michael D. Jahr, op-ed, Dec. 26). Michigan's independent day-care providers, mostly small business owners, were blind-sided by a mail-in unionization vote in which 15% of the day-care providers (heavily pro-union) determined the employment status of the non-voting 85% of providers.
The rationale for Michigan's unionization of day-care workers (and for home health-care workers in several other states) is that users of such services often are receiving financial aid from the state. Michigan created a shell agency to facilitate the ruse of an employer-employee relationship in the industry (despite the sole-proprietorship nature of most day-care businesses) and then proceeded to siphon off millions of dollars of union dues from payments made to day-care providers.
It would be illegal for Michigan to directly transfer money into the coffers of the UAW or the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. However, a shell government agency and a stealth unionization process in the day-care sector offered a way around an unethical or illegal money transfer scheme. (Technically, money laundering requires that the cash be obtained through criminal activities; in this case, Michigan's cash-strapped taxpayers are pinched for the funds that are earmarked for union payments.)
Messrs. Wright and Jahr describe similar arrangements in several other states where state and federal taxpayers pick up the tab. Not surprisingly, the Service Employees International Union is on the receiving end of many such payments.
It may turn out that the day-care and home health-care union sham violates state laws or the Constitution. Be that as it may, fleecing taxpayers to provide the revenues that pass quickly through the hands of small business owners (now designated as union employees) on their way into the pockets of unions that are closely connected to state governments is a process that fails to meet a basic smell test: In a state that has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, such a poor use of Michigan's resources certainly qualifies as disgraceful, if not criminal.


States and the Stimulus
Remember how $200 billion in federal stimulus cash was supposed to save the states from fiscal calamity? Well, hold on to your paychecks, because a big story of 2010 will be how all that free money has set the states up for an even bigger mess this year and into the future.
The combined deficits of the states for 2010 and 2011 could hit $260 billion, according to a survey by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Ten states have a deficit, relative to the size of their expenditures, as bleak as that of near-bankrupt California. The Golden State starts the year another $6 billion in arrears despite a large income and sales tax hike last year. New York is literally down to its last dollar. Revenues are down, to be sure, but in several ways the stimulus has also made things worse.
First, in most state capitals the stimulus enticed state lawmakers to spend on new programs rather than adjusting to lean times. They added health and welfare benefits and child care programs. Now they have to pay for those additions with their own state's money.
For example, the stimulus offered $80 billion for Medicaid to cover health-care costs for unemployed workers and single workers without kids. But in 2011 most of that extra federal Medicaid money vanishes. Then states will have one million more people on Medicaid with no money to pay for it.
A few governors, such as Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Rick Perry of Texas, had the foresight to turn down their share of the $7 billion for unemployment insurance, realizing that once the federal funds run out, benefits would be unpayable. "One of the smartest decisions we made," says Mr. Daniels. Many governors now probably wish they had done the same.


Poland Cuts Pensions for Communist-Era Officials
WARSAW, Poland -- Poland has cut the pensions of more than 24,000 communist-era officials and secret-police officers because they violated human rights, a government official said Tuesday.
A law passed by parliament last year, which took effect Jan. 1, cuts the monthly payments of communist-era police officers, border guards, prison guards and firefighters by an average of more than 50%, Interior Ministry spokeswoman Malgorzata Wozniak said.
Poland's now dominant center-right parties have pushed to punish communist-era leaders and officials for their role in supporting the communist system imposed on Poland after World War II.
High-ranking former officials saw their pensions reduced by around 4,600 zlotys ($1,600) per month, while checks for many lower-ranking officials were also cut but will remain around $1,000. The national average is some $570.
Among those affected are Poland's last communist leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and other former top communist officials who imposed martial law in 1981 in an attempt to crush the Solidarity movement.


Paula Dobriansky: The Realist Case for Tibetan Autonomy
When President Obama didn't meet with the Dalai Lama during his October trip to Washington, it gave many the impression that human-rights promotion was not central to this administration's foreign policy. This impression needs to be promptly corrected. While the U.S. accepts that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China, for decades our country has supported Tibetan autonomy, especially in culture and religion. If the U.S. were to step back from this position, increased Chinese repression of Tibetans would likely follow.
Such repression would also have adverse consequences for China. A China that engages in harsh repression is incapable of ensuring domestic stability. An oppressive China is also unable to function as a responsible global player—something that the U.S. has long sought to encourage.
Contrary to the oft-repeated, but erroneous claims to the contrary, the U.S. commitment to Tibet—which began during the Nixon administration—has not harmed U.S.-Chinese relations. The overarching principle for both China and America has been stability and consistency. Any alteration of America's long-standing policy toward Tibet would prompt the opposite result.
It would certainly not earn us any lasting gratitude from Beijing. Any rebalancing of American policy toward China would most likely cause the Chinese to conclude that the U.S.—beset by an economic crisis—is retrenching from many of its traditional commitments and can't be counted on to pursue robust policies across a range of international issues. If China were to reach such a conclusion, it would be inclined to be less helpful to the U.S. on such issues as Iran, North Korea or even economic cooperation.


Strassel: Young Guns II
Through the tall trees of northern Wisconsin, Republican Sean Duffy is stalking a giant. The 38-year-old district attorney is talking fiscal responsibility, job creation, entitlement reform. He's scoring Washington for higher taxes, and for a health-care takeover. He's Facebooking and Twittering. He comes across as a serious yet positive reformer, a combo that has caught the public's eye.
Meet the new Young Guns.
The recent wave of Democratic retirements bodes well for Republicans. Yet they are still largely winning by default. The public doesn't like the Democratic agenda, but it hasn't forgotten the GOP's own corruption and loss of principle. And crafting a new image is a tough haul for a minority that is stuck responding to events, and that is still populated by many of the same, entrenched faces.
What is happening instead is a real (if underreported) effort to reshape the party from the bottom up—to, in effect, repopulate it with a crop of reformist candidates in the midterm. Behind the effort are three congressmen—Wisconsin's Paul Ryan, Virginia's Eric Cantor and California's Kevin McCarthy.


Lincoln Log-Rolling
It may only be a matter of time before Arkansas' Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln calls it quits. According to Rasmussen's latest poll of Arkansas likely voters, all four potential Republican rivals are trouncing Ms. Lincoln. Two out of five voters say they view her very unfavorably while only 5% say the same about State Senator Gilbert Baker, her best-known GOP challenger, who leads Ms. Lincoln by 51% to 39%.
Ms. Lincoln may have effectively thrown in the towel when she cast her vote clearing the way for passage of ObamaCare in the Senate. Fifty-one percent of Arkansas voters strongly oppose ObamaCare, and 51% consider cost-control the biggest problem with health care. Arkansas voters are no dummies. They realize that ObamaCare won't reduce their health-care costs but would saddle their state with more unfunded mandates. Mr. Baker, playing off the naked political payoffs to other Democratic Senators who voted for ObamaCare, quipped that Ms. Lincoln of had brought home "nothing more than unfunded mandates and government-controlled health care."
Ms. Lincoln's strategy to salvage her electoral bid seems to be capitalizing on voters' anger with fellow Democrat Ben Nelson's sweetheart Medicaid deal for Nebraska. She has publicly called for the political deal to be removed from the final bill and told reporters at a Kiwanis lunch this week that "the people of Arkansas didn't send me to Washington to be a horse trader."
Ms. Lincoln hasn't said whether she will vote for the final bill. However, given that she has fallen in line with the Democratic leadership at every step, she's unlikely to cast the only opposing Democratic vote and kill the bill. Washington is rife with suggestions that the Obama administration should provide jobs for legislators who lose their seats because of ObamaCare. Ms. Lincoln perhaps will be at the head of the line.

N.Y. Terror Suspect Pleads Not Guilty
NEW YORK -- A Queens part-time building superintendent pleaded not guilty Saturday to charges he received training from al Qaeda and conspired to commit murder outside the U.S. after he was arrested Thursday in a probe of an alleged terror plot in New York.
Adis Medunjanin, 25 years old, pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country and receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Viktor Pohorelsky in Brooklyn.
Mr. Medunjanin, who wore a black hooded ski parka and warmup pants during the hearing, faces life in prison on the charges. A bearded Mr. Medunjanin said little during the hearing and held his hands behind his back during the arraignment.
"In court he entered an emphatic not guilty plea," said Robert Gottlieb, Mr. Medunjanin's lawyer. "We have declared very, very loudly that he is not guilty."
Mr. Medunjanin is being held without bail pending a detention hearing on Thursday.


Soccer Team Attacked in Angola
CABINDA, Angola -- Togo's national soccer team, devastated by a shooting attack on its bus that killed at least three people, withdrew from the African Cup of Nations on Saturday.
The bus was in Angola about six miles from the border of Congo when the gunfire began. When the ambush ended, 30 minutes later, the driver was dead and the team's assistant coach and spokesman were mortally wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the convoy was targeted.
The attackers fled back into Congo after the ambush, which also left at least eight players gravely injured, officials said.
Angola's government blamed the region's main separatist group, the FLEC, who also took responsibility for the attack, according to reports from Portugal's state-run Lusa news agency.
"The championship will go on" despite the attack and the absence of Togo's team, said Angola's Sports Minister Goncalves Muandumba, whose government is hoping the tournament will give the country a chance to show it is recovering from decades of war.


Bob Dole: Taxing Details That Harm Patients
While rushing to save a patient, a physician's first responsibility is to "do no harm." That requires remembering that sometimes a treatment can make things worse. And so it should be with the health-care reform moving through Congress. Clearly this issue is too big and too important to ignore. For America's sake, reform needs to happen. But it's also too complex an issue to rush a treatment with details that might cause harm.
The Senate legislation imposes this yearly premium tax on for-profit and not-for-profit health plans, generating an estimated $60 billion in tax revenues over its first nine years. Government-run programs would be exempt from the tax. However, the tax would be levied on Medicare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and Tri-Care for the families of military dependents when delivered by a private-sector plan.


Two Killed in Georgia Shooting
KENNESAW, Ga. -- A police spokesman said two people were killed and three others were injured after a disgruntled former employee opened fire at a suburban Atlanta business.
Cobb County police spokesman Joe Hernandez said the lone gunman was in custody. Mr. Hernandez said the suspect fled the Penske Truck Rental facility Tuesday in a pickup truck and was arrested about a mile away.
Mr. Hernandez said the gunman was wearing camouflage.
Penske spokesman Randy Ryerson said four of the victims were employees and the other was a customer.
Earlier reports said three people were killed.


U.N. Bodyguard Rescued From  Rubble
UNITED NATIONS—A 38-year-old U.N. bodyguard was pulled unscathed from the rubble of the U.N.'s collapsed headquarters in Port-au-Prince Thursday morning by international rescue teams. But the man he once protected, Hedi Annabi, the head of the U.N. mission, has yet to be found, along with more than 185 other U.N. personnel.
Using dogs and listening equipment, teams from China, France, the U.S. and the Dominican Republic found Tarmo Joveer, an Estonian, then pulled him from the rubble of the smashed Christopher Hotel, said U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The U.N. had its headquarters in the hotel.
Mr. Joveer was "located when scratching sounds were heard," Mr. Ban said. "He was given water through a rubber pipe, and he was extracted from approximately four meters of rubble."
Mr. Joveer was treated for minor injuries, Mr. Ban said, and was later released. "It was a small miracle during a night which brought few other miracles," the secretary general said.
As many as 100 U.N. workers, including Mr. Annabi, were still trapped, he said. "Unfortunately, we have not yet had any confirmed news about the safety of Hédi Annabi," Mr. Ban said. "I hope he is okay, I hope. I sincerely, I pray for him."


Rescuers Race Clock as Desperation Grows
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – The first signs of food, medicine and other international aid began trickling in to the devastated Haitian capital on Friday, even as despair grew among the survivors of this week's deadly earthquake.
In neighborhoods where the aid began to arrive, Haitians swarmed to find help and medical supplies. Outside Haiti's national public-health laboratory, scores of wounded pleaded to get inside, where a squad of Belgian first-responders and Canadian military medics had set up a temporary field hospital.
People carried injured relatives on makeshift gurneys. One the sidewalk outside the gates, a teenage girl lay on a filthy mattress, near an old woman on a table with a crumpled umbrella shielding a bleeding knee. A young man, eyes wide with terror, was carried by compatriots on a piece of plywood. His distended leg was swollen and leaking pus.
Inside, medics tried to attend to the worst cases, setting broken bones and soothing screaming children.
"Now it is emergency medicine, like war medicine, amputations, cleaning wounds, keeping people alive," said Ronald Ackermans, a nurse from outside Antwerp and part of a team of 60-odd medics and search-and-rescue personnel who flew Wednesday night from Brussels.


Is Congress As Wise As Our Teachers?
I laughed when I read American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten's letter ("We Teachers Are Right to Be Wary," Jan. 12). She writes: ". . . teachers were asked to OK the application before they were allowed to read it. Only a fool would sign an important document without reading it, and teachers are no fools."
I couldn't help but think of how many members of Congress voted yes on the stimulus, budget and health-care bills without reading them. Here's to hoping President Obama is as smart as the teachers Ms. Weingarten represents and that he reads the greatest (and longest at 2,000-plus pages) entitlement bill since Social Security before signing it. But at least we all will have the five days which candidate Obama promised we'd have to view the bill on the Internet before he signs it, right?

Big Tobacco in Secret Talks with Government
WASHINGTON—Tobacco industry lawyers met secretly with Solicitor General Elena Kagan in an effort to avoid the government's last-ditch attempt to extract billions from companies that illegally concealed the dangers of cigarette smoking, the Associated Press has learned.
Four cigarette makers that control nearly 90% of U.S. retail cigarette sales have until Feb. 19 to persuade the government not to go to the Supreme Court and ask the justices to step into a landmark 10-year-old racketeering lawsuit.
In 2006, a judge ruled that the industry concealed the dangers of smoking for decades. Despite that finding, lower courts have said the government isn't entitled to collect $280 billion in past profits or $14 billion for a national campaign to curb smoking.
As part of any effort to convince the government that it should skip a trip to the Supreme Court, the tobacco companies may have to drop plans to ask the justices to overturn the ruling that the industry engaged in racketeering.
On behalf of the industry, Washington lawyers Michael Carvin and Miguel Estrada made their pitch against seeking Supreme Court review in a mid-December meeting at the Justice Department with Ms. Kagan, according to two Washington attorneys outside the government who are familiar with the meeting in her office.


Haitians Flee Capital
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—Haitians by the thousands jammed into rickety wooden buses and open trucks to escape the capital on Saturday, days after a killer earthquake leveled much of the city and turned it into an epicenter of despair.
Armed with little more than hope and the clothes on their back, they headed for the countryside, hoping to leave behind the persistent tremors and the corpse-littered wreckage of the capital.
In the scramble to flee, Lucien St. Cyr and his little boy Jean Edy lucked out. Both jammed into a red open pickup with about 40 others who screamed and shoved in a battle over the available space. The passengers were hoping to make it to Jacmel, on the southern coast of Haiti some 50 miles away. The road was ruined, they were told, so the bus would take them about half-way. They then would have to walk over a broken section of road to catch another bus.
Mr. St. Cyr hoped to find shelter with a friend there. "We don't know what to expect there, but we have nothing here. We have to leave," he said. Their house fell in the quake, destroying all their possessions.
Roberthe Pierre and his huge tribe of relatives, meanwhile, were left in the rank dust. Mr. Pierre sadly watched that group depart. Tall and thin, he stood among 11 relatives, while another 12 sat on the ground nearby. Hundreds of others milled around the intersection, one of many in the capital where buses and pick-ups were being boarded.


Judges Trim Jail Time for Child Porn
More federal judges are showing leniency toward individuals who view child pornography but who aren't themselves molesters, according to recent data on prison sentences.
Judges are looking skeptically at prosecutors' requests to give 15- to 25-year sentences for viewing sexual images of minors, handing down more sentences of five to 10 years, or in some cases probation. The movement has been gaining steam over the past two years even as the Justice Department has made child pornography and other child-exploitation prosecutions a top priority, leading to more than 2,300 cases last year, the highest figure since the department began tracking the statistic.
"We've reached a critical momentum for change," said Troy Stabenow, a federal public defender in Missouri whose critique of child-pornography sentences has been cited by judges. "The recent sentences are signaling, as strongly as I have ever seen, that judges around the country think the current system is broken."
For years, federal sentencing guidelines have provided that someone convicted of downloading child porn would receive a minimum of five years in prison, plus extra time for, among other things, using a computer or having more than 10 images. Judges were rarely able to deviate from the guidelines. But Supreme Court rulings in 2005 and 2007 effectively made the guidelines advisory, not mandatory. Now, judges increasingly are giving prison terms for child porn that are lower than the range recommended by the guidelines.
In the 12 months ended September 2009, federal judges gave prison sentences below the guidelines in 44% of cases in which individuals obtained child pornography or shared it with others, up from 27.2% two years earlier, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a federal agency that develops the guidelines. Those figures exclude cases in which judges gave lighter sentences at the prosecutors' request. In the same two-year period, the rate by which judges gave below-guideline sentences for all criminal cases rose to 16.9% from 12.5%.


James Q. Wilson: Will Washington Pay for the Terror Trials?
The plan to put five terrorists on trial in Manhattan (and possibly to put other terrorists on trial in neighboring Brooklyn) has raised profound questions.
How can a civilian trial protect classified information? Will the judge dismiss the charges if the defense claims the defendants were tortured? Why should murderers be tried so close to the place where thousands of their victims died? Is there any chance of finding disinterested jurors in a city that suffered so much from radical jihadists?
Recall what happened when Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and his associates were tried in New York City for attempting to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993. The government was required to disclose the identity of all of its unindicted co-conspirators in the case, a list that included Osama bin Laden and many of his followers. Bin Laden and others knew immediately that they had to be on the lookout.
But there is another question that deserves an answer: Why should New York City and law enforcement agencies there bear the burden of a trial foisted on them by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder?
The trial will take place in lower Manhattan. To protect the courthouse, the New York Police Department will establish a rigid inner circle bounded by Worth, Madison, Pearl and Centre streets. Vehicles entering the perimeter will be thoroughly screened and searched.


U.S. to Appeal Blackwater Dismissal
BAGHDAD -- The U.S. will appeal a court decision dismissing manslaughter charges against five Blackwater Worldwide security contractors involved in a deadly 2007 Baghdad shooting, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday.
Mr. Biden's announcement after a meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani shows just how diplomatically sensitive the incident remains nearly three years later.
Blackwater security contractors were guarding U.S. diplomats when the guards opened fire in a crowded Baghdad intersection. Seventeen people were killed, including women and children, in a shooting that inflamed anti-American sentiment in Iraq.
The U.S. rebuffed Iraqi demands that the U.S. contractors face trial in Iraqi courts. After a lengthy investigation, U.S. prosecutors charged five of the contractors with manslaughter and took a guilty plea from a sixth.


Saudis Find Bodies Near Yemen Border
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—Saudi Arabia's assistant defense minister said Saturday that the bodies of 20 of the 26 soldiers reported missing were found on the border, raising the toll for the fight against Yemen's Shiite rebels to 133.
Prince Khaled bin Sultan told reporters the bodies were found after "liberating" areas around Dokhan mountain, a strategic high point in the rugged border region. He said six soldiers are still missing.
On Thursday, Saudi Arabia said its army lost 113 troops, including Lt. Col. Saeed Matuq al-Omari, a paratrooper and a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War.
Saudi forces launched a sweeping offensive against the rebels after they crossed the border on Nov. 5, killing two Saudi border guards. A Saudi general has described the war with the poorly armed Yemeni Hawthi rebels, as "close to a guerrilla war."
The rise in the toll underscores the ferocity of the fighting with the Yemeni rebels, who have been battling their own government since 2004 over neglect and discrimination. The rebels have gained a reputation for being cunning adversaries, taking full advantage of the rugged mountainous terrain of their homes in northern Yemen.


Georges Anglade, Political Activist, Geographer
The Haitian earthquake was the final chapter in the story of Georges Anglade, a Haitian geographer, political activist, and fiction writer known to generations of schoolchildren in Haiti as author of a popular geography text.
Mr. Anglade, age 65, was killed with his wife, Mireille, when a house in Port-au-Prince collapsed on them while they were visiting family.
The couple were on their annual extended winter visit to the island nation where they grew up, met, and were married. Later, they lived as expatriates in Canada. Mrs. Anglade, a retired United Nations economist, was working with a women's organization she helped lead, and Mr. Anglade was to share his most recent fiction at a Port-au-Prince literary conference. After a career writing academic papers and political tracts, he had turned in retirement to writing short stories called lodyans, a sardonic Haitian genre.
"He had a goal of winning a literature Nobel," says Mr. Anglade's daughter, Pascale Anglade, who brought her husband and children to visit her parents in Haiti over the Christmas holidays.
Mr. Anglade, an opponent of the Duvalier government—a father-son dictatorship that ruled Haiti with a heavy hand starting in 1957—was imprisoned in 1974 and then deported that same year. He joined a vibrant Haitian expatriate community in Canada, where he was a professor of geography at the Université du Québec à Montréal.


New Blast Hits Central Baghdad
BAGHDAD—A suicide car bomber killed at least 21 and injured dozens more in a strike against interior ministry offices in central Baghdad, a day after several prominent hotels were also hit by suicide attacks.
The timing of the blast, a day after Iraq hanged former leader Saddam Hussein's cousin "Chemical Ali," prompted speculation that the latest attacks were retaliation by Sunni insurgents.
But the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. Raymond Odierno, said he saw "absolutely no connection" between the bombings Monday that killed at least 41 people and the execution of Ali Hassan al-Majid. The U.S. military didn't have any immediate comment on Tuesday's bombing.
"We didn't turn Chemical Ali over until yesterday afternoon. .. There was no way anybody could have known about that," Gen. Odierno said Tuesday during a question-and-answer session with reporters in his office at Camp Victory, the U.S. military headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
The toll from Monday's attacks continued to rise, with 41 people confirmed killed and up to 106 reported injured, police and health officials said.


OECD Likely to Raise Growth Forecast
PARIS--The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will probably revise up its global economic growth forecasts in March or May, Secretary General Angel Gurria said Tuesday.
"I think the numbers we may put out in March, and certainly in May, are going to be better than the economic outlook given in November, or at least looking more positive than in November," he said at a briefing in Paris. "This suggests [the recovery] may have happened a little faster and sooner, the question is sustainability and the path" to be taken, he added.
Mr. Gurria warned however that he was talking about "a few decimal points" and that it would be a stretch to return to high growth rates quickly, because of the higher cost of money and higher unemployment.
"We are going to see a more mixed set of indicators in 2010. Certainly in the case of unemployment, it is going to increase through 2010," Mr. Gurria said. He added that in some countries unemployment may be close to the top and may plateau in 2010.
Mr. Gurria said that the effects of government stimulus will continue to be seen in 2010, especially in countries like the U.S. where stimulus plans were backloaded.


Lawyer Denies Suspect Sought to Tamper With Landrieu's Phones
An attorney for conservative activist James O'Keefe denied Wednesday that his client had sought to tamper with phones at the New Orleans offices of Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, after he and three other men were arrested and charged by federal officials.
"There was no bugging of telephones, no wiretapping, no trying to interfere with the phone system," said Michael Madigan, a Washington attorney representing Mr. O'Keefe. "We're cooperating with the U.S. attorney's investigation and are confident that the true facts will come out."
The men are accused of participating in a scheme Monday in which two allegedly posed as telephone repairmen and entered Ms. Landrieu's office to tamper with the phone lines. Mr. O'Keefe, Joseph Basel, Stan Dai and Robert Flanagan were charged with entering a federal building under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony.
The men haven't entered pleas. They are scheduled to appear in federal court in New Orleans on Feb. 12. An attorney for Messrs. Basel, Dai and Flanagan didn't return a call for comment.
Federal authorities says Messrs. O'Keefe and Dai admitted to helping conceive and execute the plan, and that Messrs. Basel and Flanagan admitted they entered Ms. Landrieu's office posing as repairmen.


Randy E. Barnett: Obama Owes the High Court an Apology
In his State of the Union address, the president of the United States called out the Supreme Court by name for sharp condemnation and egged on his congressional supporters to jeer its recent decision:
"Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests—including foreign corporations—to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong."
Even before he finished, hundreds of Democratic senators, congressmen and cabinet officials surrounding the six seated justices stood, applauded and cheered.
Suppose for a moment that you were a justice seated there as the president of the United States singled you out for criticism and the room stood and cheered. Could they take it? Yes, of course. Should they have been put in this position? Absolutely not.
This is not to deny that the Supreme Court may be criticized. I do it regularly in class, op-eds, blog posts, and in the pages of law reviews. So too should the president when he thinks the Court is wrong. But not when the justices are in attendance as a courtesy to him, seated as a captive audience on national television, while surrounded by hundreds of his political partisans. Imagine the howls if the president had been a guest in the House of Commons when the British prime minister called him out for failing to live up to his promises in Copenhagen about imposing a carbon tax.


Engine Hazards Found on Embraer Jets
Concerned about potential malfunctions of ice-protection systems on hundreds of Embraer regional jetliners, aviation regulators in Brazil and Europe have issued safety directives intended to prevent both engines on such planes from shutting down in mid-flight.
The related moves, likely to be followed shortly by the Federal Aviation Administration, stem from software problems regulators believe could "result in loss of automatic activation" of ice-protection systems for engines on some Embraer 170 and 190 jets. If pilots fail to react properly in such circumstances to certain cockpit warnings, according to the safety directives, ice may build up on engines inlets "and cause a dual engine shut down."
Brazilian regulators issued a directive earlier this week, and the European Aviation Safety Agency adopted the identical measure on Friday.
Under the mandatory directives, which go into effect in 10 days, airlines will be barred from flying such Embraer jets unless mechanics first investigate specific onboard computer warning messages generated on the ground. In some cases, current rules allow planes to take off despite the appearance of these computer warnings, with follow-up checks deferred until later. The directives don't make any reference to incidents or accidents.
A U.S. spokeswoman for the manufacturer, Brazil's Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica SA, didn't have any immediate comment. An FAA spokeswoman said Friday that the U.S. agency is aware of the Brazilian directive and FAA officials "are considering taking similar action."


U.S. Trustbusters Try to Regain Power
WASHINGTON—If populism is emerging as a potent new force in American politics, then government trustbusters and sympathetic Democrats in Congress stand ready to offer a new outlet. But first, they'll have to overcome a major hurdle: the judges.
Over the past three decades, U.S. courts have sharply limited the scope of the 120-year-old Sherman Antitrust Act, which has been used to target companies from Standard Oil to Microsoft Corp. In so doing, judges have clipped the wings of two agencies charged with policing anticompetitive behavior: the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
Now Democrats on Capitol Hill are joining forces with antitrust cops to push back against the judicial tide. Congress is preparing measures to reverse the effect of court rulings that have made it harder for the government to win antitrust cases and break up monopolies, while the FTC and Justice Department are trying out new legal tactics to reclaim lost powers
If successful, the efforts could presage an upswing in antitrust cases against America's leading companies and reverse the legal trends of recent years.
Sensing a shift in the political landscape, big business is girding for a fight. "Voters are demanding jobs and growth, but Washington is moving in the opposite direction by advancing an agenda focused on increased litigation against business," said Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an offshoot of the Chamber of Commerce that seeks to ease the burden of civil litigation for businesses.


EPA, OPM Complain About Their Budgets
WASHINGTON – The in-house watchdogs of the Environmental Protection Agency and the agency that oversees federal hiring have complained that President Obama's proposed 2011 budget doesn't give them enough money to do their jobs properly, according to documents released Monday.
Bill A. Roderick, the EPA's acting inspector general, warned in a Dec. 9 letter to budget director Peter Orszag that Mr. Obama's budget would leave the EPA "vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse," because it authorizes big increases in spending for various forms of clean water grants that have "long been identified as areas of high risk," but doesn't provide a corresponding increase in funding for his office's audits and investigations.
An EPA spokeswoman said the Obama administration requested $55.8 million for Mr. Roderick's office in 2011, a $1 million increase over the level Congress enacted in 2010. Mr. Roderick had sought $64.8 million, according to the EPA spokeswoman. Mr. Roderick didn't respond to messages seeking comment Monday.
Mr. Obama's budget proposal calls for cutting the EPA's overall budget by about 2.6% in 2011 over 2010 levels, to $10 billion from $10.3 billion.
Separately, the inspector general of the Office of Personnel Management, Patrick McFarland, has also complained that Mr. Obama's budget request "would substantially inhibit" him from performing his duties, according to a copy of Mr. Obama's budget proposal made public Monday. The document doesn't elaborate on the reason for Mr. McFarland's objection. Mr. McFarland's office declined to comment Monday.


Make the Call to Islamabad, Mr. Singh
When it comes to India-Pakistan relations, there seems to be one certainty for 2010: If nothing changes, they will only get worse.
We have been told time and again that another attack on India from Pakistan is inevitable. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the warning on his recent visit to India and Pakistan, saying that al Qaeda and its affiliated groups – read Lashkar-e-Taiba – were determined to spark another Indo-Pak war.
Even as the dire warnings pour in – "You WILL be attacked!" – the governments of both countries have so far chosen to take the path of least courage. That is, they have maintained the same frozen state of sour relations that has existed since India pushed the international community to push Pakistan to acknowledge that the Mumbai attackers sailed from Karachi and to round up some suspects.
The subsequent trial in Pakistan of some of those allegedly involved has been insufficient to satisfy India that the matter is being treated with adequate seriousness to warrant any thaw. Pakistan, meanwhile, insists it is ready to restart stalled talks with India on a wide range of issues but that India should recognize that Pakistan is doing what it can to stop the menace of terrorism.
In other times, this might all be delicate diplomatic posturing (at best) or (more likely) the predictable utterances of two distrustful nations not quite at war but not really at peace. People would yawn and get on with their lives.


Mergers, Closings Plague Charities
(Please see Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
Hearth, a Boston-based nonprofit, has a mission of helping people like Yvonne Rock find housing and medical care.
Ms. Rock, a 59-year-old former mental-health counselor, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and can no longer work. After nearly a year on Hearth's waiting list for an apartment, she still has nowhere to live.
But Hearth is badly in need of charity itself. The group lost $325,000 in government contracts last year, laid off five employees and cut managers' pay. Its plans to add housing units are stalled because it hasn't been able to raise the final $600,000 from private donors to qualify for matching government funds. Yet Hearth is receiving more applications for housing than it can process.
"We've had funding cut after funding cut, and we never know when the next shoe is going to drop," says May Shields, Hearth's chief operating officer.


No Private Reward for Public Risk
Peter Wallison contends that existing firewalls are sufficient to protect insured deposits from high-risk proprietary trading activity conducted at the holding company level ("The President's Bank Reforms Don't Add Up," op-ed, Jan. 25). But this opinion conveniently overlooks the reality of the market and the symbiotic relationship among parents, subsidiaries and affiliates.
The market's perception does not distinguish between the bank holding company and the bank. Events at the holding company can create a lack of confidence in the bank.
The benefits of explicit and implicit guarantees, as well as funding advantages afforded to banks, enrich the bank holding company. It is naïve to suppose that these advantages do not also benefit and even subsidize the proprietary activities of nonbank affiliates.
Finally, the reality of the market is that risk flows downward, but rewards flow upward. That is precisely the asymmetry that President Obama is seeking to change in his proposal to restrict the scope of bank holding company activities. When risk is transmitted down to insured depository institutions, it is really pushed onto the American taxpayer. It is time to stop socializing risk while privatizing reward.

Michael Barone: A Short History of American Populism
It was a "populist night," Yale Law School professor and longtime New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse wrote of Barack Obama's State of the Union address. The president denounced "bad behavior on Wall Street" and called for "a fee on the biggest banks." He said he wanted to take "$30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid" and give it to community banks. He denounced CEOs who reward themselves for failure and bankers who put the rest of us at risk for their own selfish gain. He denounced "insurance company abuses." He called for higher taxes on "oil companies, investment fund managers and those making over $250,000 a year."
Mr. Obama seemed to be taking the advice of those on the political left who have long argued that there is political profit in populism—in framing issues as battles between "the people and the powerful," in the words of multiple clients of the gifted Democratic speechwriter Robert Shrum. The assumption is that populism—policies that would, in candidate Obama's words to Joe the Plumber back in 2008, "spread the wealth around"—is a winning political strategy.
But American history teaches a different lesson. Looking back and trying to find when populism worked is like looking back for that golden age when Democrats and Republicans basked in bipartisan harmony. The 1990s? The Clinton impeachment. 1980s? Iran-Contra. 1970s? Watergate. 1960s? Vietnam. 1950s? Communism, corruption and Korea. The mirage seems to get farther away the farther you look.
So it is with populism. Ask anyone reasonably well versed in American history to name our most populist-minded president, and you'll likely hear the name of Andrew Jackson. He was the son of Scots-Irish immigrants, raised on the frontier, and he ran the first democratic (and Democratic) campaign. A gang of Jackson's roughneck supporters, so the legend goes, rushed to the White House after his inauguration and tore the place apart.
But Jackson was not a "spread the wealth" populist. On the contrary, he opposed the American System of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay to have the government build roads and canals and other public works. He killed the central bank and paid off the national debt.

Fault Found in Afghan Outpost's Fall
KABUL—A U.S. military investigation into how the Taliban overran a remote U.S. Army combat outpost last fall, killing eight soldiers and injuring 22, has concluded that "inadequate measures taken by the chain of command" facilitated the attack.
Following the report's conclusion, a summary of which was released Friday, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, has taken "appropriate action" against the officers involved, the U.S. military said. It didn't release the officers' names or specify the nature of the action.
The three-pronged Taliban attack on Combat Outpost Keating, in the Kamdesh district of Afghanistan's Nuristan province, on Oct. 3 has been trumpeted by the insurgents as a major achievement. Though the attack was repelled after several hoursof combat, the U.S. military evacuated and destroyed the outpost, which housed some 60 U.S. troops, three days later. Coalition troops are no longer present in that area, and most of Nuristan has fallen under insurgent control.
At dawn of Oct. 3, a force of some 300 fighters, supported by indirect fire from surrounding mountains, managed to overrun Keating's perimeter, torching its generators, disabling its tactical operations center, and suppressing the American troops' ability to fire mortars in self-defense, the investigation report said.
The insurgents also took over the nearby Afghan police station, while Afghan army soldiers guarding the eastern side of the outpost failed to hold their positions. The American unit deployed at the Keating outpost was the Bravo Troop of the 3rd Squadron of the 61st Cavalry Regiment, a part of the 4th Infantry Division. The regiment's commanding officer is Lt. Col. Robert Brown. His superior officer is Col. Randy George, commander of the division's 4th Brigade Combat Team.


Seeing Might Have Meant Believing
Regarding your editorial "ObamaCare's Excuses" (Feb. 4): President Obama states that unpopular health-care reform legislation can be forced through Congress if "the American people understand exactly what's in the bill." If that were true, it would be helpful if first the members of Congress knew what was in it. If one's goal is to have the American people understand the program, it would be helpful not to prepare 400 pages of amendments behind closed doors and add them to a 2,000-page Senate bill that was already incomprehensible.
By the way, one reason that no one can understand what is in the bill is because there are two bills. If the president really wants the American people to understand the two incompatible bills, he should have told the Senate majority leader and the House speaker not to side-step the promise to broadcast the meetings of the House-Senate conference committee by cynically eliminating the meetings.
President Obama's statement is wildly delusional considering he must know that the only hope for the legislation rests on these efforts to prevent the American people from knowing what it contains.

Ranbaxy Gets FDA Warning
BANGALORE, India—Signs mounted that Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.'s U.S. regulatory troubles might not be over after the nation's health watchdog accused the drug maker of making an insufficient effort to meet manufacturing standards.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also wants the Indian unit of Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co. to comprehensively assess its operations that supply drugs to the U.S.
The U.S. is Ranbaxy's biggest overseas market, and sales there have been flagging for more than a year because of manufacturing deficiencies at some of its plants. Analysts said any resolution of the regulatory issues is unlikely soon.
The FDA's latest observations were part of a warning letter dated Dec. 21 and sent to Ranbaxy's U.S. unit, Ohm Laboratories Inc., for violating some manufacturing practices at a plant in Gloversville, N.Y. The letter wasn't made public until it was posted on the FDA's Web site on Tuesday.
The company's shares have been under pressure since. On Friday they fell sharply after reports of the severity of the FDA's language and amid broader concerns over ballooning sovereign debt in some European countries. Ranbaxy closed down 5% in India on Friday at 404.85 rupees ($8.68).


Hong Kong's Political Lessons
The Hong Kong government won a victory in the courts last Wednesday, upholding a law that will erode the ability of private institutions to completely control schools that receive public funding. The biggest loser here is the Catholic Church, which has ably educated much of the territory's elite. It has also been one of the government's biggest critics in recent years. That has raised suspicions that Hong Kong is playing politics with education and undermining the civil society that is an integral part of the way of life guaranteed under the Basic Law.
The law requires all "aided" schools in Hong Kong to set up incorporated management committees that would give 40% representation to teachers and parents. Rather than having to attract their own students, aided schools are assigned students by the government, receive a significant amount of public support to offer tuition free of charge and are run by outside sponsoring bodies, most of which have religious affiliations. Out of 1,150 day schools in Hong Kong, 850 are categorized as aided schools.
It remains a puzzle why the government insists on creating these bodies when most such schools already have parent-teacher organizations that contribute indirectly to the administration of the school. Perhaps the answer lies in examining the sponsoring bodies of the more prestigious aided schools. Schools run by the Catholic Church have always been highly regarded among Hong Kong parents who fight to enroll their children in the 180 aided schools run by the local diocese. Among their alumni network are numerous social, economic and political leaders including Chief Executive Donald Tsang and Secretary for Education Michael Suen.
Cardinal Joseph Zen, who retired last year as head of the Hong Kong diocese, has been an outspoken advocate for civil liberties and democratization, for instance calling Catholics onto the streets for the July 1, 2003 march that eventually brought down the government of then Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa. He has also criticized mainland China's refusal to allow Catholics to recognize the Pope.
Mr. Tsang might want to consider what happened to his predecessor's efforts to use education to score points with Beijing. Mr. Tung forced schools to stop teaching in English in favor of Cantonese, a move that was so unpopular that it was effectively repealed last month. Undermining the institutions that have served Hong Kong well for generations in order to take a swipe at critics won't win supporters for a government whose popularity rating approaches depths last seen under the hapless Mr. Tung.


We've Enabled Castro, Not Hurt Him
As I read your editorial "Castro's Hostage Politics" (Feb. 6), I had to check the date on my paper to make sure I was in 2010 and not 1960.
Over 50 years later you still promote the same rhetoric that has garnered absolutely nothing for the people of Cuba, or for the U.S. in its relationship with the island. Somehow we have managed to have relationships with countries which were once our mortal enemies, like Germany, Japan and Vietnam. We rationalize our dealing with still-existing totalitarian regimes like China and Russia. Yet we stand firm on Castro.
For a long time our policy has been rooted in nothing more than misguided pride. We view any change as a capitulation not only to a dictator, but even more insulting, to the dictator of a little island. It rankles us that no matter what we have thrown at him, he has thumbed his nose at us and even seems to laugh at us. He has understood our ego better than we have.
We gave him the footing he sought all these years, as he could always count on us to do something which would allow him to paint us as imperialist bullies. He will go to his deathbed laughing at the U.S. for its unnecessary intransigence. Had we used the same diplomatic, commercial and humanitarian tactics that we did in the countries previously mentioned, plus the ones that we are now trying to use in the Middle East, we might have changed the fortunes of the Cuban people a long time ago.
Unfortunately our pride got in the way.


China Against Obama-Dalai Lama Talks
BEIJING -- China demanded Friday that the U.S. withdraw its plan for a meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama, calling it a "wrong decision" and warning that such a meeting could harm bilateral ties, in a strongly-worded statement that reflects increasingly strained relations between the two countries.
In a statement, China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said China resolutely opposes the Dalai Lama's to the U.S. and any contact between U.S. leaders and the exiled Tibetan leader.
On Thursday, the White House announced the Obama would meet the Dalai Lama on Feb. 18
"We urge the U.S. side to fully understand the high sensitivity of Tibet-related issues, honor its commitment to recognizing Tibet as a part of China and opposing "Tibet independence'," Ma said.
He said the U.S. risks "further harming China-U.S. relations" and demanded that the U.S. desist from any actions that would damage Tibet's stability or interfere in China's domestic affairs.


India's Green Counter-Revolution
Few countries have benefitted more from the Green Revolution than India, which in the 1960s succeeded in averting famine by introducing genetically modified strains of wheat and rice. So it's a pity to see the government backsliding on the next generation of GM foods, this time in the form of a campaign against the humble egglplant.
Environment and Forestry Minister Jairam Ramesh announced Tuesday that he would halt indefinitely the commercial cultivation of genetically modified eggplant, known locally as Bt Brinjal. He cited a need to "build a broader consensus" so India can "harness the full potential of GM technology in agriculture in a safe and sustainable manner."
It's unclear what consensus would satisfy Mr. Ramesh. The eggplant in question, developed by a local Indian company that's partly owned by Monsanto, has been undergoing testing for a decade. India's own Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, composed of eminent scientists from across the country, approved the strain in October, adding it was "effective in controlling target pests, safe to the environment, nontoxic as determined by toxicity and animal feeding tests, non-allergenic and has potential to benefit the farmers."
Which makes Mr. Ramesh's decree no small setback. India is the second-largest eggplant producer in the world. Its farmers lose around 40% of the crop annually to a pest that the genetically modified strain would have suppressed. Modern science could have increased crop yields, improved safety and lowered costs for India's poorest citizens.
Instead, Mr. Ramesh has resurrected a decade-old "Frankenfood" scare over GM foods. The Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi dubbed Tuesday's decision "a question of public health, which can't be compromised at any cost." This represents the typical stance of green groups, who use the precautionary principle to argue against all genetically modified crops despite the scientific evidence of their safety.


Pakistan Confirms Baradar's Capture
ISLAMABAD—Pakistan on Wednesday officially confirmed the arrest of a top Afghan Taliban commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
Major General Athar Abbas, the chief military spokesman, said in a statement that after a detailed identification procedure it has been confirmed that one of the arrested people was Mr. Baradar.
It is the first time a senior Pakistani official has confirmed the report of Mr. Baradar's detention. The Taliban commander was seized from the southern port city of Karachi earlier this month, according to people familiar with the matter. Gen. Abbas said the place of arrest and operational details couldn't be revealed for security reasons.
The capture of Mr. Baradar was a breakthrough for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan and came after months of U.S. pressure on Pakistan to crack down on Afghan Taliban leaders residing there.


The Chance of Litigation Shouldn't Kill ObamaCare
I am not surprised to find Curt Levey's ominously titled, "Health-Care Reform Could Create a Litigation Explosion" (op-ed, Feb. 11) on the Journal's opinion pages.
I suppose one can file a constitutional claim over anything, but every law student knows that social and economic legislation is subject to rational basis equal protection review, which means that the plaintiff loses. Of course, one never knows what novel constitutional arguments our activist conservative judges will find persuasive, but under current law constitutional challenges against the health-reform statute will be dismissed as frivolous.
Health-care reform will result in some litigation, but lawyers not driven by ideology will advise their clients that their money is better spent elsewhere.

Pilot Lands Unauthorized at LAX
A young pilot without a valid license and flying an allegedly stolen single-engine propeller plane on Friday made an unauthorized pre-dawn landing at Los Angeles International Airport
The rogue touchdown by the 23-year-old pilot, identified by police as Skye Turner, set off security alerts before he was arrested and charged with stealing the Cirrus SR22, according to federal aviation and law-enforcement officials.
The pilot landed the aircraft on the airport's southernmost runway around 3 a.m., after executing a "missed approach," according to a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. The agency's records show that a Skye E. Turner obtained a student pilot's license in September 2004, which expired two years later.
Investigators believe that the pilot, upset about a domestic dispute, originally had planned to crash the plane into the Pacific Ocean and then reconsidered, according to two people familiar with the details. The pilot was so disoriented after landing that police officials suspected he was intoxicated. But that didn't turn out to be the case, one of these people said.
An FBI spokeswoman said the pilot was detained by airport police and remained under arrest there, while he was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Los Angeles police subsequently filed charges. The FBI spokeswoman didn't provide any details about the alleged theft. The pilot may face further charges stemming from his expired license. An airport spokesman didn't have any immediate comment.


Sudan President Signs Darfur Pact
Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, facing charges of war crimes, signed a preliminary peace accord with a rebel group in the Darfur region to help end the conflict in the oil-rich nation.
Officials in Doha described the agreement as temporary cease-fire, backed by a promise between the two sides to forge a final settlement that could include a power-sharing arrangement with the rebel group. The sides were also expected to negotiate the possibility that representatives for the rebels, known as the Justice and Equality Movement, or JEM, could become an officially recognized political party. Compensation for those killed or displaced by the seven years of fighting in Darfur is also on the table, according to officials familiar with the talks.
JEM representatives and spokesmen for the Sudanese government didn't immediately respond to requests seeking comment on Tuesday's cease-fire accord.
Unresolved issues may undermine a permanent peace agreement, however. On Tuesday, JEM accused Sudanese troops of attacking the rebels – despite the cease-fire – although the government denied the attack, Reuters reported. And while some other rebel factions may join in this agreement, it could alienate those who feel their grievances aren't being addressed, analysts say. Such a deal "will be difficult to implement on the ground," said Fouad Hikmat, a Sudan expert at the International Crisis Group, an independent think-tank in Nairobi. The other rebel groups, he added, "could become spoilers."
Still, the government and Dafur's main rebel group have much to gain from a lasting agreement.


Indonesian Police Widen Tax Probe
JAKARTA—Indonesian police are stepping up a high-profile tax-evasion investigation whose targets include a company tied to one of Indonesia's most senior political and business leaders, Aburizal Bakrie.
Director General for Taxation Mohamad Tjiptardjo told reporters Tuesday that 1.8 million individuals and institutions owe the government 44 trillion rupiah ($4.7 billion) in unpaid taxes.
In the latest salvo, a senior police official said Tuesday that authorities have banned an official at PT Kaltim Prima Coal, whose parent company is part-owned by Mr. Bakrie's business group, from leaving Indonesia in connection with the tax investigation. Kaltim Prima allegedly owes 1.5 trillion rupiah and the parent company, PT Bumi Resources, 376 billion rupiah.
"We have imposed a ban on one of Kaltim Prima's officials from traveling overseas, and will take further action" in the case, the head of criminal intelligence, Commissioner General Ito Sumardi, told reporters. Mr. Sumardi identified the official only by the initial "R."
The travel ban is the latest development in a case that has drawn attention because of Kaltim Prima's indirect ties to local politics, including a complex battle over a 2008 bank bailout that has dominated Indonesian news in recent weeks.


Words Alone Don't Lead to Credibility
The financial crisis is becoming a political crisis, not just in Greece, where a nationwide strike has paralyzed the country, but potentially across many other highly indebted countries.
Governments made extravagant promises to their citizens in past decades. Now those commitments risk coming into conflict with promises made to bondholders.
Ultimately, promises to bondholders will have to be met in some form, as without their confidence, the promises to voters will be impossible to fulfill for any length of time. But elected politicians face a challenge to persuade skeptical markets that they can be trusted to deliver—a challenge made harder by their track records.
Take Europe. The Maastricht Treaty included a commitment by member states to limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP and total debt of 60% of GDP. These rules were more honored in the breach than the observance, not least by France and Germany which suffered no penalty in response.
Similarly, the U.K. government tried to win fiscal credibility by introducing a "golden rule": It wouldn't borrow to fund current spending over the course of an economic cycle and that borrowing wouldn't exceed 40% of GDP. But the pledges weren't worth the paper they were written on. The government fudged its assessment of the economic cycle and shoved borrowing off balance sheet to enable it to keep spending.


Amputee Arrested in Alleged Bomb Attempt
An amputee missing both legs was arrested Thursday after police said he was wheeled into a busy New York City train station and planted a bomb.
Police found the bomb before it could detonate, but the discovery interrupted regional train lines briefly and closed the station for several hours.
The alleged device—a bag of small explosives wrapped in shotgun shells, along with bullets, glue, lug nuts, pens and a ruler—was left in a waiting area at a station in Harlem. Police later surveyed security videos to identify suspects including, Roosevelt Terry, the amputee. Police from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the Metro-North Railroad that was shut down, arrested Mr. Terry late in the afternoon.
"If the thing blew, people would have gotten hurt .. could have even gotten killed with all the stuff in there," said Bill Morange, director of security for the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The incident is still under investigation.


Raising Malaysia's Hackles
The prosecution of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is proceeding apace, but that doesn't mean international pressure is useless. Witness the government's reaction to recent international criticism.
The reaction was swift. Some 500 members of the ruling coalition's youth wing and sympathizers protested in Kuala Lumpur last week, calling the letter a "trampling" on "sovereignty." Youth leader Khairy Jalamuddin told us in a telephone interview that the trial is a judicial process, not a political one.
Yet the Malaysian response, far from being a deterrent, only shows how sensitive the country is to international pressure. The letter's coordinator, Labor MP Michael Danby, says Malaysia is one of Southeast Asia's relative success stories and any threat to its fledgling pluralistic democracy should not be lightly disregarded. "You wouldn't want us to be quiet on Aung San Suu Kyi, neither should we be quiet on what's happening to Anwar Ibrahim," he says.
International attention may not change the course of Mr. Anwar's trial, but at the very least, it reminds Malaysia's elites that their actions won't go unnoticed—or, perhaps, without consequences.


Let's Have More Good Bipartisan Thinking on Taxes
I appreciate Sens. Ron Wyden and Judd Gregg's efforts to make our tax code fairer and simpler, but in regard to personal taxes most of their ideas miss the mark completely ("A Bipartisan Plan for Tax Fairness," op-ed, Feb. 23).
The complexity is not due to a graduated scale with six brackets or itemized deductions. The complexity has to do with trying to make the tax law equally fair for everyone.
There are countless targeted social incentive provisions, each with its own set of complex parameters dutifully sprinkled with exception after exception, all in the name of fairness. How did this happen? Well-intentioned politicians with little background in taxation—and worse, little insight into the far-reaching law of unintended consequences—have in the name of fairness and social justice (and gathering votes) turned our funding for government into toxic tax weeds which are poisoning the body politic. It's not the brackets, stupid. It's the code.
The phrase "fairer and simpler" is an oxymoron. When will someone in Washington understand this? The two are mutually exclusive. The alternative minimum tax was designed to make it fairer so that a few hundred people would pay at least some tax. Today, it's a nightmare. The history of almost every line on Form 1040 is similar.
Every time Congress carves out a niche to make the tax fairer, it sets up parameters, rules and exceptions, all of which by their very nature continually change. This exponentially increases complexity, discourages compliance, confuses the public and undermines government.


A Tale of Two Quakes
Chile's 8.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday did fearsome damage, with 708 dead as of this writing and more to come as collapsed buildings and roads are excavated. Yet for a quake that was the fifth biggest ever measured, and several hundred times larger than the one that killed more than 220,000 in Haiti, the destruction could have been much worse. It's worth asking why it wasn't.
But such preparation is also the luxury of a prosperous country, in contrast to destitute and ill-governed Haiti. Chile has benefited enormously in recent decades from the free-market reforms it passed in the 1970s under dictator Augusto Pinochet. While Chileans still disagree about Pinochet's political actions, they have not repealed most of that era's economic opening to the world. In the 2010 Index of Economic Freedom, compiled by the Heritage Foundation and this newspaper, Chile is the world's 10th freest economy. Haiti ranks 141st.
The political and moral necessity of economic growth ought to be a commonplace observation, yet it is too commonly forgotten by those who have only known its benefits. That includes many in America who want government to impose limits on growth because growth often brings with it the tumult of disruptive change. They think prosperity is guaranteed, when in fact it must be earned every day and can vanish over time under the wrong policies and corrupt governance.


Former Monster Executive Gets Probation in Backdating Case
A former senior executive of Monster Worldwide Inc. will not go to jail for his role in backdating millions of dollars' worth of employee stock-option grants at the company because he cooperated in the case, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.
Myron Olesnyckyj, who served as general counsel, was sentenced to one year of probation at a hearing in Manhattan federal court. He had faced up to 25 years in prison.
The sentencing of Mr Olesnyckyj, who pleaded guilty to charges in 2007, ends a string of criminal cases involving former executives at the company. Monster owns the online job-search Web site Monster.com.
The company's founder, Andrew McKelvey, also admitted to scheming to violate accounting rules by making it appear as if options were granted on dates in which Monster's stock price had been at a periodic low point, instead of the dates when the options were actually awarded.
The company's former president, James Treacy, was convicted at trial last year for the same conduct, which lasted from about 1996 to 2003, prosecutors said.


In Zurich, A Fish Is Entitled to a Lawyer
ZURICH—Last month, Antoine Goetschel went to court here in defense of an unusual client: a 22-pound pike that had fought a fisherman for 10 minutes before surrendering.
Mr. Goetschel is the official animal lawyer for the Swiss canton of Zurich, a sort of public defender who represents the interests of pets, farm animals and wildlife. He wound up with the pike as a client when animal-welfare groups filed a complaint alleging animal cruelty in the fish's epic battle with an amateur angler.
The case emerged after a local newspaper photo showed the fisherman proudly showing off the four-foot-long fish—a scene that, to Mr. Goetschel, was reminiscent of a safari hunter with his foot perched on the head of a dead lion. "It is this Hemingway thinking," he says. "Why should this be legal when other animals have to be slaughtered in a humane way?"
Mr. Goetschel is the only official animal lawyer in Switzerland, but that may be about to change. On Sunday, the Swiss will vote on a referendum that would compel all of Switzerland's cantons to hire animal lawyers. The rationale: If people accused of mistreating animals can hire lawyers, the victims of such abuse are also entitled to representation.
The Swiss government is urging voters to reject the referendum, arguing the money should instead go to uncovering animal abuse. Switzerland's farm lobby is against the proposal and argues that farmers are already closely monitored by state veterinarians.


Pakistan Urged to Name Finance Minister
ISLAMABAD—Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari is under pressure to name a credible finance minister after the previous officeholder—a vocal critic of government corruption—resigned almost two weeks ago, citing personal reasons.
Failure to quickly replace Shaukat Tarin, a well-respected former Citibank executive, comes as Pakistan's financial policies are under close scrutiny from the International Monetary Fund and foreign government donors that have pledged billions of dollars to stabilize the South Asian nation's economy.
The IMF has earmarked $11.3 billion in emergency loans for Pakistan since November 2008, when Islamabad faced a balance of payments crisis. To get regular disbursements of this money Pakistan has to meet goals such as reducing its budget deficit, reining in inflation, increasing tax collections and improving electricity supply.
Although the IMF has praised Pakistan this year for stabilizing its exchange rate and increasing foreign reserves, it is concerned with the vacillation over a replacement for Mr. Tarin, a senior Pakistani government official said.
A senior IMF delegation raised the issue in a meeting with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani last week. "The IMF officials told the prime minister that they hope a credible person would be appointed soon," said the official, who was present at the meeting. A representative for the IMF wasn't available to comment.


Obama Makes Last Pitch for Overhaul
ST. CHARLES, Mo.-- President Barack Obama pitched the cost-saving benefits of his health plan Wednesday, and made a campaign-style closing argument for the overhaul in his second trip outside Washington this week.
"The time for talk is over," he told a small but cheering crowd gathered in a high school gym. "It's time to vote."
As Congress prepares for final votes on the health bill, the president is pushing his case hard in public and private. He plans a third trip in this final stretch to Northeast Ohio on Monday. Meantime, his health secretary pressed the case in Washington, D.C., urging insurers to tone down their opposition.
Speaking in this St. Louis suburb, Mr. Obama linked the health care bill to a new initiative to root out wasted government payments to health-care and other contractors. The effort to recapture some $100 billion a year in wasteful and fraudulent government payments is a Republican-inspired idea that extends far beyond payments to private Medicaid and Medicare contractors. But rolling it out now is meant to show the administration is serious about saving money on health-care, and wants to include Republican ideas in its plans.
"You don't like seeing your money wasted. That's a responsibility my administration is seeking to fulfill every day," he said.


China's Jobless 'Ants' Draw Concern
BEIJING—A string of villages on the outskirts of Beijing has become the unlikely focus of a national discussion about China's stubbornly tough job market for young people, as officials meet in the capital for the annual session of China's legislature.
The area north of Beijing is populated by young people who call themselves the "ant tribe" because of their industriousness as well as their crowded, modest living conditions. Members of the National People's Congress, which is meeting this week in Beijing, held a press conference Thursday to highlight the plight of unemployed graduates and call for far-reaching reforms in the education system, which they say hasn't prepared students adequately for the job market. Proposals included more vocational training and greater interaction between schools and employers.
"The living conditions of some 'ants' could easily make people feel worried and also trigger people's discontented mood," said Ge Jianxiong, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the advisory body that meets alongside the congress this week. "This has to be given great attention by both the government and society."
Earlier this month, some conference members visited the village. Several said they were moved to tears when they heard two students, who share a five-square-meter (54 square-feet) room, sang a song they composed about their tough lives.
Government statistics show 87% of college graduates found work last year. But many graduates doubt those figures, and they say that jobs that are available often pay a barely livable wage.


Mom: Paulin-Ramirez Drifted Away
LEADVILLE, Colo.—Slumped on her couch with her cigarettes, her fading photographs and her memories, Christine Holcomb-Mott said she no longer knew what to believe.
Her 31-year-old daughter, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, had been taken into custody in Ireland, linked to an alleged plot to kill a cartoonist who satirized the Prophet Mohammed.
Mrs. Holcomb-Mott hadn't talked to her daughter in days. She didn't know whether she had a lawyer, a court date, an explanation. But her daughter's behavior over the past few months, including she says, possible correspondence with a foreign national who wanted to take flying lessons in the U.S., unnerved her.
The Wall Street Journal hasn't reached Ms. Paulin-Ramirez and some events that her mother recounts about her daughter's home life couldn't be independently verified. But Mrs. Holcomb-Mott says she had been feeling estranged from her daughter for nearly a year.
Though they lived under the same roof, in a pink-painted house with wind chimes out front, the mother and daughter rarely talked, except to argue about Ms. Paulin-Ramirez's abrupt adoption of the Islamic faith and her decision to veil herself in a hijab. These tensions existed in the household despite the longtime embrace of Islam by Mrs. Holcomb-Mott's husband, George Mott.


Goli Ameri: Ayatollah Khamenei, Tear Down These Walls
Last year on March 19, U.S. President Barack Obama extended a hand to the Iranian leadership on the occasion of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. That outreach failed to unclench Tehran's fists. This year the President should speak directly to the people of Iran, America's most potent allies. Below is what Mr. Obama should say today, an adaptation of President Ronald Reagan's speech at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin in 1987—powerful words that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Let me extend my very best wishes to all who are celebrating Nowruz around the world. Eideh shoma mobarak!
Today I would like to speak directly to the brave people of Iran. As President Reagan said, it is the duty of American presidents to speak of freedom.
Standing before these walls, every man is an Iranian and as long as these wall are permitted to stand, the question of freedom for all mankind remains open.


Facebook Settlement Approved
A federal judge has approved a $9.5 million settlement of a federal class-action lawsuit over alleged privacy violations by Facebook Inc.
Under terms of the settlement, Facebook will contribute $6 million to set up a non-profit foundation that will award grants to projects that "promote the cause of online privacy, safety and security."
The suit was filed in August 2008 on behalf of people who said that Facebook had violated their privacy with its Beacon technology, which posted information about them online without their permission.
When Facebook launched Beacon, it caused an uproar among some users who discovered that information about purchases they had made on third-party sites was posted on Facebook without their knowledge. Facebook has since shut down Beacon.
"We're pleased that [U.S. District Court Judge Richard] Seeborg has approved the settlement after carefully considering all opinions," Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a prepared statement. "The independent foundation will fund worthy projects helping protect and improve Internet users' privacy, safety and security. We look forward to providing additional details on the foundation in the weeks and months ahead."


Tribes Press for Action Against Taliban
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan—A large gathering of leaders from Pakistan's embattled tribal regions met Saturday, demanding that the army intensify its war against the Taliban in their homeland.
More than 700 tribal leaders from the border areas with Afghanistan, a mountainous region that has become a battleground between the Pakistan army and the Taliban, said they would make a formal demand to the United Nations to intervene in the conflict area if the army failed to step up its military campaign.
The gathering, known as a jirga in the local Pashtu language, was organized by Amn Tehrik, or Peace Movement, a group of ethnic Pashtun intellectuals and professionals from the tribal belt in the northwest of the country. A number of Pakistan's national political parties also attended.
"We will not rest until we banish the terrorists from the whole tribal region," said Syed Alam Mehsud, a leading member of Amn Tehrik.
Pakistan's army has made progress in the war against the Taliban since 2008, killing scores of Taliban leaders, but has lost thousands of soldiers. U.S. drone strikes have targeted a number of the Taliban's top cadre, including a strike earlier this month that appeared to kill a leader who is believed to have played a key role in the bombing of a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency post in Afghanistan last year.


Notable & Quotable
Progressives believe that the natural course of history is the emergence of secular rationality as the true way to think about problems and of state power as the effective way to organize society along rational lines. If that is your worldview, then such things as revealed religion, cultural tradition, and the marketplace (whose outcomes are spontaneous, not rationalized) are vestiges of our primitive past, sure to be displaced by the spreading application of human reason. When liberal politicians describe themselves as "progressives," that is not just because "liberal" has acquired unpopular connotations but because progressive is the more accurate word for their core beliefs..
The grip of progressivism is probably the best explanation for the Democratic Party's astonishing campaign to nationalize the U.S. healthcare sector by all means necessary. To attempt to enact a radical and unpopular program in a bill that includes many corrupt provisions, on a party-line vote and through a procedural trick (if the "Slaughter solution" is employed) that seems clearly unconstitutional, appears quite mad and self-defeating to the outsider. But it is not mad .. to those who think it is .. historically inevitable that the government must administer medical care. In this view, the political actor is simply holding history's coat while it does its work. Political untidiness, even the loss of an election, are transitory considerations. The progressive mindset also explains, as more than populist demagoguery, the contempt that the proponents of ObamaCare exhibit for doctors and pharmaceutical and insurance companies—for they are the practitioners of a benighted form of health care that is about to be swept away by a new and higher form.


Pope Apologizes to Irish Catholics
VATICAN CITY—Pope Benedict XVI said he was "truly sorry" for the rash of sexual abuse cases that have spread through Ireland's Roman Catholic Church and announced plans to have Vatican officials carry out an inspection of Irish dioceses where abuse occurred.
In an eight-page letter issued Saturday to Irish Catholics, Pope Benedict said the Vatican will conduct an investigation known as an Apostolic Visitation of "certain dioceses" in Ireland, as well as of seminaries and religious orders. The pope's letter didn't specify which dioceses would come under investigation. Papal spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said at a Vatican news briefing Saturday that the Apostolic Visitation would target diocese where "local governance has not been sufficient."
The pope's letter offered some of Pope Benedict's most extensive remarks on what he considers the root causes of priestly sexual abuse of minors, which he described as "criminal acts." However, the pope didn't outline new policies or disciplinary actions for confronting the thousands of abuse cases—many dating back decades—that have been documented in Ireland in recent years by the Church and government-appointed investigators.
The letter also stopped short of addressing the hundreds of allegations of priestly abuse that have emerged in other parts of Europe in recent months, including a spate of allegations in Pope Benedict's homeland of Germany.
"You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry," the pope wrote, addressing Irish victims of abuse and their families. "I know some of you find it difficult even to enter the doors of a church after all that has occurred."


U.S., Mexico Expand Drugs Fight
MEXICO CITY—The U.S. and Mexican governments on Tuesday unveiled a "guns and butter" strategy for cracking down on Mexico's violent drug cartels, promising to use not only military force, but social and economic strategies as well.
During a high-profile visit by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a number of senior Obama administration officials, both sides agreed to expand cooperation under the $1.3 billion Merida Initiative, a three-year program begun in 2008 aimed at helping Mexico quell rising drug-related violence that has killed some 18,000 people in the past three years.
The strategy goes beyond the initial focus on disrupting drug gangs through police and military means. It includes trying to strengthen Mexico's institutions and rule of law; creating a "smart" border that stops drugs, guns and drug money but allows commerce to continue; and trying to address the underlying problems that fuel drug violence, such as a lack of job creation.
"To combat the long-term effects of the drug trade, we want people to feel economic security and health security," Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference.
Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, said the U.S. would try to speed up the delivery of aid under the Merida plan. Only $128 million of the Merida money has been delivered to Mexico, which is still waiting for delivery of key items to fight drug gangs, such as Black Hawk helicopters.


Obama's TSA Pick Bows Out
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama's second pick to head the Transportation Security Administration has withdrawn his name from consideration, after a raft of questions about his private security business doomed his bid to take over the office responsible for screening in American airports.
The TSA has been without a full-time boss for more than a year, even as attempted terrorist attacks, such as the Christmas Day underwear bomber, have highlighted the ongoing vulnerability of commercial aviation to deadly threats.
Retired Maj. Gen. Robert Harding, a 33-year verteran of military intelligence, threw in the towel late Friday, after facing two days of tough questioning from congressmen in nomination hearings this week. President Obama's first pick, Erroll Southers, withdrew in January after Republicans targeted his views on unionizing airport screeners. "It is with deep regret that I submit my withdrawal for nomination as the Assistant Secretary of DHS, Transportation Security Administration," Gen. Harding said in a statement released by the White House. "I feel that the distractions caused by my work as a defense contractor would not be good for this Administration nor for the Department of Homeland Security."
Gen. Harding's nomination turned into an uphill struggle due to his work with Harding Security Associates, the security firm he founded in 2003 after retiring from the Army.
The firm landed a contract to provide interrogators in Iraq, and was later embroiled in a contract dispute with the Pentagon and had to repay $1.8 million to the U.S. government. Additionally, Gen. Harding's firm did business with major defense and technology contractors, as well as the Department of Homeland Security itself, which raised concerns about conflict of interest. Gen. Harding, who sold his stake in the business last July, offered to recuse himself from DHS business with that firm as well as several major contractors for a period of two years. White House assistant press secretary Nick Shapiro declined to say when the administration would name a third potential head for the TSA.


Steven Greenhut: Vallejo's Painful Lessons in Municipal Bankruptcy
In 2008, Vallejo, Calif., was nearly broke. Faced with falling tax revenues, rising pension costs, and unmovable public-employee unions, the city was unable to pay its bills and declared bankruptcy. Now, as it prepares to emerge from Chapter 9, officials in Los Angeles, San Diego and other cities across the state are looking to see if Vallejo has blazed a trail for them to get out from under their own crushing pension costs. What they're finding is that even bankruptcy may not be enough to break the grip unions have on the public purse.
Vallejo is a Bay Area community of 121,000 that two years ago became the state's largest city to declare bankruptcy. Like other municipalities, its public-sector unions had driven its budget deep into the red. A report issued by the Cato Institute last September noted that 74% of the city's general budget was eaten up by police and firefighter salaries and overtime along with pension obligations. The average city in the state spends 60% of its budget on those things.
Over the past five years, Vallejo has slashed spending where it could, mostly by cutting personnel and services. As a recent San Francisco Chronicle editorial pointed out, the city cut its police force to about 100 officers from nearly 160 and warned residents to use the 911 system judiciously, even while it experienced crime rates higher than other comparable cities in California. The city has also cut funding for a senior center, youth groups, and arts organizations and has done little to restore an increasingly decrepit downtown, develop waterfront properties, or attract new businesses.
To permanently bring its spending in line with its tax base, however, at some point Vallejo will have to do something about its pensions. U.S. bankruptcy judge Michael McManus, as the National law Journal reported last March, "held the city of Vallejo, Calif., has the authority to void its existing union contracts in its effort to reorganize."


Pensions Press GM, Chrysler
WASHINGTON—General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC may need to contribute "substantial" sums to their employee pension plans in coming years to comply with U.S. laws, the Government Accountability Office said Tuesday.
The ability of GM and Chrysler to make the contributions remains uncertain, and largely depends on whether the companies return to profitability, reported the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
U.S. Treasury Department officials expect GM and Chrysler to eventually make money, the GAO said, in which case the companies could likely afford to maintain the funds. However, the ability of the Detroit auto makers to return to profitability is linked to the health of the U.S. economy and whether employment levels improve, the GAO said.
GM projects that it will need to contribute $12.3 billion to its pension plan through 2014 to meet federal funding requirements, the GAO said. Chrysler may need to contribute $3.4 billion to its plan through 2015.
"Since 2008, the funded status of the pension plans has been declining, and within the next five years, both companies project that, based on current estimates, they may need to make large contributions to their plans to comply with federal minimum funding requirements," the GAO reported.


Former Harvard-Law Dean Has Long Been on Short Lists
Elena Kagan, who has long been rumored as a possible Supreme Court choice, has spent much of her professional career in academia.
The 49-year-old was dean of Harvard Law School from 2003 until last year, when she became U.S. solicitor general, the Justice Department lawyer who represents the government before the Supreme Court. She is the first woman to hold that position.
She was lauded for her leadership at Harvard in overcoming ideological divisions on the faculty to hire professors whose views spanned the political spectrum, former colleagues say.
But her nomination as solicitor general by President Barack Obama, whom she met in the 1990s when they both taught at the University of Chicago Law School, was more contentious than expected. She won only seven Republican votes in being confirmed by the Senate.
"It's hard to tell exactly where she falls ideologically" said Charles Fried, a Harvard law professor who worked closely with Ms. Kagan when she was dean. He added that this was "one of her strengths."


D.C. Circuit Judge Is Least Likely to Offend GOP
Merrick Garland, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, long a pipeline to the Supreme Court, could be one of least controversial choices to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens, according to legal experts.
However, there might be concerns from the Democratic base that Judge Garland's judicial philosophy isn't liberal enough.
Several prominent conservatives have publicly suggested Judge Garland, 57 years old, could pass muster. "Obama's first appointment to the Supreme Court should be a judge's judge, a Democrat no doubt, but one who commands the respect of conservative court watchers," Hoover Institution scholar Peter Berkowitz wrote in the Weekly Standard after the 2008 election. "By virtue of his knowledge of the law and his judicial temperament and integrity, Merrick Garland..comes to mind."
Still, Senate Republicans could raise questions about a 2009 decision by the D.C. Circuit from which Judge Garland dissented. The court dismissed a lawsuit against defense contractors for allegedly taking part in the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, saying the contractors were immune to suits because they were working under the military.
But Judge Garland has earned credibility on the national-security front. Before he was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton in 1997, Judge Garland served as a senior federal prosecutor. He supervised the domestic-terrorism cases against the men responsible for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and against Ted Kaczynski, the "Unabomber."


Tories to Propose Marriage Tax Break
LONDON—The U.K. opposition party will announce plans Saturday to use proceeds of a levy on banks worth at least 1 billion pound (about $1.5 billion) to fund a marriage tax break, a person familiar with the situation said.
The tax break will allow one member of a married couple or civil partnership to transfer 750 pounds of their tax-free personal allowance to the person's partner in order to reduce the partner's income-tax bill.
The measure, which comes weeks before a general election due May 6, will be limited to basic-rate taxpayers and is therefore worth up to 150 pounds a year, the conservatives say.
The conservatives believe the measure, which delivers on a key conservative pledge to their supporters, will cost 550 million pounds.
The party is expected to say it will be paid for by a levy on banks which would raise more than 1 billion pounds. The rest of those funds will be used to reduce the deficit.


Summers on Demand
Even when we disagree with Larry Summers, we've long thought of him as a better economist than politician. But after reading his nearby letter to the editor, we may have to reverse our judgment. The senior White House aide is abandoning his former economic views to serve the Democratic Party's current political purposes.
The paragraph we quoted followed a subhead, "What Causes Long-Term Unemployment?" Here is how the passage reads in more complete form:
"To fully understand unemployment, we must consider the causes of recorded long-term unemployment. Empirical evidence shows that two causes are welfare payments and unemployment insurance. These government assistance programs contribute to long-term unemployment in two ways.


Obama Cancels Trip to Poland
WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama's trip to Krakow, Poland, for the funeral of Polish president Lech Kaczynski and first lady Maria Kaczynska has been canceled due to poor flying conditions caused by a cloud of volcanic ash that has closed airspace across northern Europe.
Press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement that Mr. Obama called Acting President Bronislaw Komorowski early Saturday afternoon to express his continued condolences and inform him of the decision.
"I spoke with acting President Komorowski and told him that I regret that I will not be able to make it to Poland due to the volcanic ash that is disrupting air travel over Europe. Michelle and I continue to have the Polish people in our thoughts and prayers, and will support them in any way I can as they recover from this terrible tragedy. President Kaczynski was a patriot and close friend and ally of the United States, as were those who died alongside him, and the American people will never forget the lives they led," the statement quoted the president as saying.
Mr. Kaczynski, his wife and 94 others -- including virtually the entire upper echelon of the Polish military -- perished when their plane crashed on approach near Smolensk, western Russia, April 10. The delegation, which included numerous political, religious and cultural figures, was headed to a commemoration of the 1940 Katyn Forest massacre of 22,000 Polish soldiers and intelligentsia, who were murdered by Soviet military and secret police.
There are no plans on the Polish side to postpone the funeral, despite cancellations from a number of high-ranking guests, including members of the Catholic Church hierarchy scheduled to participate in the services.


Los Angeles Outlines Budget Cuts
LOS ANGELES—In an effort to close a $485 million budget hole projected in the next fiscal year, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa Tuesday afternoon proposed eliminating 3,546 city jobs and slashing city services—from patching fewer pot holes to cutting library hours.
Most of the positions slated for elimination have already been vacated by early retirements or transfers to other city departments that do not draw from the city's main fund. But the mayor's plan would require 750 fresh layoffs in the next fiscal year, which starts July 1.
"We can't allow this economic storm to blow us off course," Mr. Villaraigosa said in his state of the city address Tuesday. "One year of cost-cutting won't solve this crisis. We must make lasting structural changes..this budget provides a beginning path."
The mayor's $4.34 billion budget proposal comes after weeks of political and financial drama that had the city's departments and leaders at odds as the city inched toward bankruptcy and saw its credit ratings drop.
The city's Department of Water & Power had refused to transfer a planned $73.5 million to the city's general fund after the city council blocked a rate hike. That prompted city controller Wendy Gruel to warn that the nation's second largest city could run out of money by May 5, unless the transfer was made. Mr. Villaraigosa named a new interim chief for the Department of Water & Power; city officials said Tuesday they expected the utility to transfer the funds.


Obama Eulogizes West Virginia Miners
BECKLEY, W.Va.—President Barack Obama eulogized 29 coal miners who died in an explosion in the nearby Upper Big Branch Mine in a speech that avoided assigning blame for the disaster.
Before the president spoke, grieving families of the dead filed into a convention center here on Sunday as the men's names were read out loud. The audience applauded for each one and a member of each family placed a miner's helmet atop one of 29 white crosses standing in a row at the foot of the stage.
"Nothing we can say can fill the hole they leave in your hearts; the absence they leave in your lives," Mr. Obama said, standing on a black-draped stage hung with photos of the men.
"All the hard work; all the hardship; all the time spent underground; it was all for their families, it was all for you.. These miners lived, as they died, in pursuit of the American dream," the president said after a vivid passage that described the men's daily five-mile journey into the mine where they died on April 5.
Vice President Joe Biden made remarks before the president, saying the miners "represent what I believe is the heart and the soul and the spine of this nation..the nation mourns them."


Getting Lucky in Times Square
Amid a close-miss this weekend in Times Square, New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg said, "We are very lucky." True enough. Whether it is New York City or any of the other open and vulnerable urban areas in the world now targeted by terrorists, luck has something to do with not getting hit. It is equally or more important, however, to understand that an aggressive, well-executed offense against this threat is more likely to protect us than dumb luck.
This investigation is in its earliest stages, but it almost certainly qualifies as an attempted act of terror, even if Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano turns out to be right that it was "amateurish." Where one draws a distinction between the professionals and the amateurs in this business is not always clear. What we do know from all the recent, similar events, here and abroad, is that the number of people joining Islamic jihadists in an effort to blow up innocent civilians is growing. The distinction between a lone nut and a member of al Qaeda is largely irrelevant after the bombs go off.
Also lucky, for example, were the people aboard the Christmas Eve airliner that was in its landing pattern at Detroit with Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab onboard and a relatively small bomb concealed and failing to detonate in his underwear. But no one is discussing Abdulmutallab's ability to board that plane in terms of luck.
In other instances, effective intelligence and police work have averted disaster. The police were onto Najibullah Zazi and his terrorist ring before they were able to carry out plans to bomb New York City's subways; terrorists successfully bombed London's subways in July 2005. Two key figures, including Zazi, have pleaded guilty in that plot.
This past October authorities in Chicago arrested David Headley (the former Daood Sayed Gilani) at the airport as he was attempting to fly to Pakistan. Headley has since been linked to the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India. With terror, it's a small world.


NTSB Urges Safety Changes After 'Hudson Miracle'
Federal aviation-safety watchdogs on Tuesday urged U.S. and European regulators to make significant changes in how jet engines are designed and tested to withstand collisions with birds.
In the wake of last year's US Airways accident in which a jetliner lost both engines from bird strikes and made an emergency landing in the Hudson River, members of the National Transportation Safety Board sketched out a wide range of safety recommendations intended to make jetliners and their pilots better able to cope with such hazards.
As part of its findings and conclusions, the safety board is expected to issue some recommendations with potentially far-reaching impact on passengers. It will vote on a recommendation urging changes in the current design of life vests, which board members said often are too hard for average passengers to quickly open and properly don.
In another potentially sweeping recommendation likely to face opposition from airlines, members said they supported asking the FAA to mandate that life vests be kept on all scheduled passenger flights—regardless of whether they include long segments over water. The FAA has previously resisted such moves based on excessive costs for airlines.
The safety board is also expected to formally call for enhanced certification standards to ensure that future jet engines are able to withstand impacts from the increasingly larger birds that experts say are becoming more common in busy U.S. airspace. In addition, the board is expected to recommend new types of sensors on engines to help pilots gauge the extent of damage after colliding with birds.


Kagan Says Rulings on Black, Skilling to Affect DOJ
COLUMBUS, Ohio—Solicitor General Elena Kagan said Wednesday that the Justice Department's approach to a wide range of criminal prosecutions hung on forthcoming Supreme Court rulings on appeals by Conrad Black and Jeffrey Skilling, former high-flying executives convicted of "honest services" fraud.
Ms. Kagan, a top contender to join the high court, crossed paths at a conference here with Justice John Paul Stevens, whose retirement this summer will create the vacancy. She praised the 90-year-old jurist but stayed away from the subject of who will get President Barack Obama's nod.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama met with Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, a person familiar with the conversation said. Previously, the president separately interviewed Ms. Kagan, Sidney Thomas, a Montana-based judge on the Ninth Circuit and Judge Merrick Garland of the District of Columbia Circuit.
Ms. Kagan is the only nonjudge known to have been interviewed. As solicitor general, she represents the government before the Supreme Court.
The government is trying to preserve the convictions of Messrs. Black and Skilling as well as a third against former Alaska state legislator Bruce Weyrauch. The three defendants argue that the law banning honest-services fraud is too vague to be constitutional, among other claims.


Greeks Gear Up Anger In Politics
ATHENS—Public outrage over economic mismanagement and corruption is forcing Greece's political leaders to clean house.
An opinion poll published in the Sunday Proto Thema newspaper shows nine out of 10 Greeks blame the country's economic crisis on its politicians. About the same percentage said politicians found guilty of wrongdoing should be jailed.
The government, with the support of the main opposition New Democracy party, is planning to abolish a controversial law granting former government ministers immunity from criminal prosecution. The proposed legislation may be introduced into parliament as early as this week. Many analysts say the New Democrats, faced with their own checkered past of various scandals and now under new leadership, are anxious to allow the legal system to rid them of some controversial politicians.
The Socialist government, elected in October, also is pushing ahead with a number of parliamentary investigations to defuse the anger over a political system that brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. One probe concerns a recent land swap with a powerful local monastery that cost the state hundreds of millions of euros.
Another reform expected in the next few days is a move to tighten up the rules disclosing the personal wealth of elected officials. The effort already has claimed its first victim. Greece's deputy tourism minister, Angela Gerekou, resigned this week after a newspaper revealed her husband, a famous local singer, owed about €5.5 million ($6.8 million) in back taxes, fines and accumulated interest. Her resignation was promptly accepted.


Afghan Insurgents Attack NATO Base
KABUL—The Taliban killed a U.S. private contractor and wounded nine American soldiers in a predawn attack on a sprawling U.S.-led air base north of Kabul on Wednesday, one week after promising a new push against Afghan and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces around the country.
Ten insurgents were killed in the attack, which failed to pierce the perimeter of Bagram Airfield, a hub of U.S. operations for eastern Afghanistan. Four of the Taliban killed were wearing suicide vests, but were shot dead before they could detonate them, according to a spokesman for the base.
Officials called the attack on the airfield, which is ensconced by several layers of defenses, part of a larger Taliban strategy of staging showy attacks that have little hope of succeeding. Bagram houses about 40,000 military personnel and private contractors.
The Taliban launched the attack at about 4 a.m., and were driven back within two hours by Air Force security personnel along the perimeter and in towers looking over Bagram. U.S. forces and Apache helicopters then hunted surviving attackers in the fields around the base, before fighting ceased at about 10:30 a.m.
The attackers had little hope of getting inside the base "considering the size of the attacking force," said Sgt. Thomas Clementson, a Bagram spokesman. "They were clearly looking for some media interest, because it seems that's all they could have achieved."


White House, Auto Industry in Talks on Emissions Targets
WASHINGTON—The White House and top auto-industry representatives are in talks on expanding a landmark agreement put in place last year that set stringent new emissions and fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks.
Senior Obama administration officials and auto-industry executives are planning a joint announcement on the effort as early as Friday, several people familiar with the matter said. These people cautioned that details were still being hashed out and that the date of the announcement could be pushed back.
The announcement would come almost a year to the day after the Obama administration said it would order auto makers to increase the fuel economy of automobiles sold in the U.S. to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, four years faster than current federal law requires.
That order resolved a dispute between the state of California, which had been pushing its own environmental targets for cars, and the auto industry, which had called for a single, national standard. The agreement among California, the Obama administration and the auto industry goes through 2016.
Auto makers are concerned that without standards put in place for 2017 and beyond, California and other states may move forward on their own, forcing the industry to abide by a patchwork of state emissions and fuel-economy targets for cars rather than one uniform standard.


Former Massey Miner Files Whistleblower Complaint
A former Massey Energy Co. miner has filed a whistleblower complaint with the Labor Department, alleging that he was fired after he made comments about conditions at two of the company's mines, including one where 29 miners were killed in April.
Ricky Lee Campbell alleged that he was fired April 23 by Massey subsidiary Marfork Coal from his job as a shuttle-car operator because he provided information in a federal investigation and "because I made safety complaints about equipment that I operated at the mine," according to a complaint filed on May 4.
Mr. Campbell worked at Massey's Upper Big Branch mine, but several days before an April 5 explosion killed 29 miners there, he was transferred to the Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine. In his complaint, he alleged that his comments to news media following the accident also contributed to his termination. The complaint was earlier reported by National Public Radio.
Massey said Mr. Campbell's claims are "completely without merit." Massey spokesman Jeff Gillenwater said that, "As the facts in this matter come to light, it will be very clear why Mr. Campbell was terminated and that his termination had nothing to do with him raising concerns about Massey Energy's safety practices."
Mr. Gillenwater said that all Massey employees "are encouraged to raise any concerns and suggestions about safety."


Arkansas Flash Floods Kill 16
Heavy overnight rains sent a surge of muddy water coursing through campgrounds in western Arkansas before dawn Friday, sweeping away dozens of people along with tents, RVs and parts of cabins.
The flash floods killed at least 16 people, many of whom had been camping by the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers in the ruggedly scenic Ouachita Mountains. An unknown number of people were still missing Friday afternoon, and the death toll was expected to rise, said Bill Sadler, a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police.
There was a continuing search "for individuals who may be stranded or bodies that may have washed up on the banks" of the rivers, Mr. Sadler said. He said patrols had no idea how long their search through the muddy, debris-strewn forest would continue. "We entered this operation not knowing who was in there, how many were in there, and where they might be," he said.
The Little Missouri is normally a placid river, just three to five feet deep this time of year. But by 5:30 a.m. Friday, it had risen to 23 feet and over-topped its banks.
Authorities and local residents said the campers were probably taken by surprise by the torrent of water.


High-Speed Rail Rivalry Gains Steam
Foreign railway operators and equipment makers are gaining steam in the race for a chunk of the $8 billion the Obama administration has awarded states for high-speed rail projects, but Amtrak, which wants to remain the nation's sole operator of high-speed trains, risks getting left at the station.
On a 21⁄2-day trip to Japan last month, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood officially hung out the welcome sign for foreign makers of high-speed passenger-rail technology to bid on the projects.
Mr. LaHood tried out Japan's high-speed trains, including Central Japan Railway Co. 's magnetic levitation train and East Japan Railway Co. 's bullet train, and he invited Japanese companies to "bring us your expertise" and "use American workers and American facilities."
The trip also had implications for Amtrak. The struggling U.S. national railway manager, whose fastest trains run between Boston, New York and Washington at speeds of up to about 150 miles an hour, is only now forming a high-speed rail department and searching for someone to head it.
"[Amtrak] would have been the default operator as recently as 18 months ago," says Brooks Bentz, a partner at consulting firm Accenture PLC who specializes in transportation. Now, "these other entities are going to aggressively chase this."

New Jersey
Montclair Man Arrested
On Sexual Assault Charge
A New Jersey man is being held on $1 million bail after being accused of sexually assaulting two women in an Irvington cemetery.
Donell Anderson, 39 years old, of Montclair was arrested on Friday after a woman called 911 around 3 p.m. and directed police to the Clinton Cemetery on Union Avenue, according to officials from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. The 38-year-old woman told police that a man had stopped her on the street in Irvington, showed her a badge and told her he had a warrant for her arrest. The man told her to get into a green Nissan Quest minivan. He drove her to the cemetery where he allegedly attempted to sexually assault her. The woman was able to escape and call police, the officials said.
Police found Mr. Anderson in the area and arrested him. At the time he was carrying two badges and a handgun, the officials said. He was arrested and charged with sexual assault and impersonating a police officer, the officials said.
Police and prosecutors investigating the case say they also linked Mr. Anderson to the March 19 sexual assault of a 22-year-old autistic woman, the officials said.
Attempts to ascertain who Mr. Anderson's lawyer was on Tuesday weren't successful.


Gangs in Osh Were on a War Footing
Interviews with witnesses in the few square blocks of Osh in Kyrgyzstan where Uzbek-Kyrgyz violence erupted June 10 indicate both sides were organized, armed and prepared for battle.
What began as a dispute two Uzbek men had over $45 lost at a Kyrgyz-owned casino mushroomed into a rampage by Kyrgyz gangs on Uzbek neighborhoods in a four-day spree of burning, looting and gunfire. But, before that, about 1,500 Uzbeks were able to burn the casino, shoot up windows in a university dorm and set cars afire. The quick mobilization of both groups suggests that the struggle to fill a power vacuum left by the ouster of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev in April could keep this central Asian country destabilized for months to come.

New Czech Government Plans Pension Overhaul
PRAGUE—The incoming Czech government is moving to assure jittery and deficit-averse markets that it intends to move swiftly to curb state spending and plug budget holes.
Miroslava Nemcova, the new speaker of the Czech parliament, said in an interview Wednesday that the government would shrink its budget deficit significantly in order to send "a clear signal to foreign investors" that Prague is serious about strengthening its finances.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Petr Necas said in a nationally televised news conference that he would personally oversee an overhaul of the state-run pension system. The government is weighing plans to raise the retirement age, currently 63 for men and 61 for women, he said.
Investors have grown increasingly skittish about public debt in the wake of the Greek crisis. Fears that Hungary and Romania wouldn't do enough to control state spending have sent those countries' currencies and bonds tumbling in recent weeks.
Mrs. Nemcova said voters in the Czech Republic gave their support to the three center-right parties now forming the coalition government because they didn't want to see a repeat of "the woes facing European Union countries such as Greece, Spain, Italy, Great Britain and Portugal."

Manhattan
Two Men Are Found Guilty In Murder-for-Hire Plot
Two New York men have been convicted in a murder-for-hire plot that left a man dead and his friend seriously injured after a brutal 2005 shooting inside an Inwood grocery store, Manhattan prosecutors said Friday.
Oman Gutierrez, who was on work release from prison at the time, allegedly recruited Jose Inoa to assassinate Edward Contreras in order to further a drug operation in Washington Heights, prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office said.
Six others also allegedly assisted in the plot, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Contreras was shot in the face and chest and a friend was shot in the face inside a supermarket on Sherman Avenue in Inwood in January 2005, prosecutors said. Mr. Contreras later died from his injuries.
"This case exemplifies the violence the drug trade perpetuates," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said.


Guide to Japanese Elections
When the television networks begin to announce their election projections after 8 p.m. Japan Standard Time on Sunday, the big question will be: Did the ruling Democratic Party of Japan get pummeled?
What a difference a year makes. Last summer -- the last time Japanese voters went to the polls -- the question was just how well the DPJ would do. And the answer was, very. The party won 308 of 480 seats at stake in the Aug. 30 election, decisively ending the Liberal Democratic Party's half-century of nearly unbroken power.
The story of the DPJ's seemingly swift fall from grace is rooted in a variety of factors, among them the party's inexperience in government; the indecisiveness of the party's first prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama; the surprising insistence of the party's second prime minister, Naoto Kan, that he pledge shortly before the election to raise taxes; a critical media; and a fickle and pessimistic Japanese electorate, skeptical about political leaders after enduring 14 prime ministers in 20 years.
We'll have full coverage of the vote here Sunday and final results when they come out Monday morning, plus a look at the fallout throughout the week.
Meantime, here's a quick guide to following the results, and understanding the election:


Sumit Ganguly: The 'Flag March' Won't Fix Kashmir
After 15-year hiatus, the Army has been deployed again in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. The trigger event this time was the death of a 17-year demonstrator who was struck by a tear-gas shell. The Army will resort to a colonial relic, the "flag march," to display military might and cow the protestors off the streets. Yet while this might work in the short term, the Army's deployment is no panacea.
The problem that the government confronts has no military solution. The anger that has spilled out into the warren-like streets of Kashmir's villages is not the work of Pakistan-supported jihadi terrorists or organized indigenous separatists. Instead it is the spontaneous outburst of a generation of young Kashmiris who have witnessed much hardship over the last two decades of the insurgency.
This anger has its roots in economic stagnation. The coalition state government has done little to attract investment into the troubled state. Kashmiris, especially young men, have limited employment opportunities.
Then there's the political stalemate between the secessionists, led the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, and the state government. Though the secessionist agenda has only limited support in the state, local demands for regional autonomy remain very popular. Despite protracted negotiations over a period of more than a decade, no tangible progress has been made.
Consequently, a substantial segment of the population harbors much pent-up frustration. Any incident, however trivial, can easily stoke this anger. In the summer of 2008, at least 50 people were killed when unrest broke out over the government's decision to allocate land for the building of shelters for an annual Hindu pilgrimage. The situation was finally brought under control only after weeks of demonstrations and violence.


Jobless Aid Vote to Come After W.Va. Senator Named
WASHINGTON—The Senate will try again Tuesday to extend expired unemployment benefits, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said.
That will give time for the new senator from West Virginia, succeeding the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, to be appointed and sworn in. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, is expected to name a temporary successor for Mr. Byrd on Friday.
The appointment should help push a six-month extension of jobless benefits over the top in the Senate. Mr. Reid spoke during a Wednesday news conference to tout a small-business lending bill.
A June Senate vote on the unemployment extension fell 58-38, two votes shy of the 60 needed to overcome procedural obstacles. But one of the no votes was cast by Mr. Reid, who did so to preserve the right to bring the measure up again.
That means as long as no senator other than Mr. Reid changes his or her vote, and assuming the new West Virginia senator votes with Democrats, the Senate will be in position to pass the extension of jobless aid Tuesday.


Somali Group Built al Qaeda Links
The terror group behind last weekend's deadly Uganda blasts recruited a local man to coordinate the attacks and received funds from al Qaeda, say investigators, as it extends its reach beyond lawless Somalia.
Al Shabaab, the Somalia-based group that has claimed responsibility for July 11's triple suicide blasts that killed 76 people in Uganda's capital, Kampala, has in recent months built up Pakistan-style terror training camps. One top leader, Sheikh Muktar Robow, has helped to transform the group from a local insurgency into a global jihadist organization modeled on, and swearing allegiance to, al Qaeda.
That picture of the group, and its development under Mr. Robow, emerged from interviews with Ugandan, Kenyan and U.S. investigators; current and former U.S. intelligence officials; and Somalis, including a member of the militant group.
A U.S. intelligence official said information gleaned from militant communications shows links between al Shabaab and al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Yemen. U.S. officials also see evidence of overlap in training and membership and say their working assumption is that al Shabaab has several hundred core members, similar to the numbers in al Qaeda in Pakistan and in al Qaeda's Yemeni outpost.
Intelligence officials say they believe al Qaeda is using the Somali group as a symbiotic host body, allowing its operatives access to other African countries. "As much as we're looking at al Shabaab, they are riding on the back of a more experienced player," said Col. Herbert Mbonye, the director of counterterrorism for Uganda's military intelligence body.


China Rejects U.S. Maritime Efforts
HANOI—China on Sunday rebutted efforts by the Obama administration to establish a formal legal process to resolve disputes between Asian nations over claims in the South China Sea.
The U.S. shouldn't internationalize the South China Sea issue, which could only make matters worse and complicate the situation, China Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said in a statement posted on the ministry's website. Mr. Yang said the best way to solve the disputes relevant to the South China Sea was through bilateral negotiations between China and the countries involved.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pushed the initiative Friday, U.S. officials said, during a meeting of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China and more than a dozen other countries.
Mrs. Clinton said the U.S. has grown increasingly concerned about the competing claims for territory in the South China Sea. China and Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have historically tussled over the region's waterways, islands and atolls.
The dispute has raised concerns that an increasingly powerful Chinese military could seek to dominate Asian waters. Tensions have risen as Chinese firms increase their exploration efforts in the region to look for new deposits of energy and minerals.


Hey, Let's Bash Toyota
BP's Tony Hayward drove Akio Toyoda's runaway cars off the 24-hour news cycle. But now that BP's hole is plugged, it's time to start wailing on Toyota again.
Last week, Toyota revealed that a federal grand jury in New York has subpoenaed documents, potentially widening probes from stuck accelerators to snapping steering rods.
Don't you just love what we do to Toyota? Why can't we do this to everybody?
Drag the CEO all the way from Japan, shove him before Congress, and make him cry.
Slap the company with the highest possible fine. Sue it hundreds of times. Convince it to recall models by the millions. Make it apologize repeatedly. (Bow more fully for the cameras next time, Mr. Toyoda.)


No Specific Timeline for Ending Deep-Water Drilling Ban, Regulator Says
NEW ORLEANS—The new head of the Interior Department's offshore-drilling agency said he won't make any recommendations about lifting the Obama administration's moratorium on deep-water drilling until at least mid-September and rebuffed repeated requests from Louisiana politicians for a more specific timeline.
Michael Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, came to New Orleans Tuesday for the first of a nationwide series of public forums his agency is hosting to solicit expert opinion on what additional safety measures the industry and government need to adopt to prevent another oil spill like the one involving BP PLC in the Gulf of Mexico.
But it was Mr. Bromwich who found himself answering questions in the forum's final minutes. A panel of Louisiana mayors, parish presidents and the state's lieutenant governor, Scott Angelle, warned Mr. Bromwich that the Obama administration's moratorium—set to expire Nov. 30—threatens up to 20,000 jobs. They urged him to make a recommendation on whether to shorten it as quickly as possible.
"Why, with all due respect, can't this moratorium be lifted today?" asked Charlotte Randolph, president of Lafourche Parish. She and other officials said the oil and gas industry has taken sufficient steps to reduce the likelihood of another blowout.
The officials cited the announcement by four major oil companies that they are forming a joint venture to design, build and operate a rapid-response system to capture and contain up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day at water depth of up 10,000 feet. BP's Deepwater Horizon well had been leaking up to 62,000 barrels per day some 5,000 feet below the surface.

The Bronx
Riker's Guard Is Given Term Of Six Years for Assault
A Riker's Island jail guard was sentenced to six years in prison for ordering inmates to assault other prisoners in an enforcement scheme known as "The Program," according to officials from the Bronx District Attorney's Office.
Bronx Supreme Court Judge Martin Marcus sentenced Lloyd Nicholson Friday for his June 17 conviction on two counts of assault. During a three-week bench trial, prosecutors contended that on June 10, 2007, Mr. Nicholson ordered six inmates in the Robert N. Davoren Center on Riker's Island to beat up two other prisoners.
Prosecutors said the attacks were part of "The Program," a scheme Mr. Nicholson and other jail guards used to maintain order. The "select group" of inmates chosen by Mr. Nicholson to carry out the attacks did so in exchange for preferential treatment in the jail including, prosecutors said, the guards looking the other way when the inmates extorted commissary and telephone privileges from other prisoners.

Unemployed Homeowners to Get Aid
The Obama administration is making $3 billion in aid available to help unemployed homeowners avoid foreclosure.
The administration announced plans Wednesday to allocate $2 billion to its "Hardest Hit Fund," which provides federal grants to state housing agencies, doubling the size of that program. The funding will be divvied up between housing agencies in 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have the highest unemployment rates. State housing officials will decide how to target that funding toward keeping borrowers from losing their homes when they face short-term unemployment.
The Hardest Hit Fund, announced in February as a way to help states design their own foreclosure-prevention programs, is currently funding initiatives in 10 states. The allocation is part of the $50 billion that the administration earmarked for housing aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
The administration will also spend $1 billion on a previously announced program under which the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide bridge loans to help unemployed borrowers who are delinquent on their mortgages. The program was created under the financial-regulatory bill that President Barack Obama signed last month.


Appeals Court Deals Acorn a Setback
Congress acted within its authority when it blocked federal funding last year for community activist group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, a federal appeals court has ruled.
On Friday, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a federal judge's ruling that cutting off Acorn's funding was unconstitutional. The judge had found that Congress had improperly passed a law that determines guilt and inflicts punishment without Acorn having the protections of a trial.
Lawmakers blocked funding to Acorn in a stop-gap spending bill last October and used identical language to specifically exclude funding to Acorn in the fiscal 2010 appropriations bill.
The group, which helped low-income people register to vote and provided counseling to low-income homeowners through an offshoot organization, announced it was disbanding in March.
"Although the appropriations laws may have the effect of alienating ACORN and its affiliates from their supporters, Congress must have the authority to suspend federal funds to an organization that has admitted to significant mismanagement," U.S. Circuit Judge Roger J. Miner wrote.


Haulers Push to Supersize
(See Corrections & Amplifications item below.)
When Kraft Foods Inc. packs trucks with weighty items such as jars of Miracle Whip and pouches of Capri Sun juice, 40% of the rigs must leave the loading dock partly empty to avoid exceeding federal truck weight limits. Kraft says those rules force it and others to make extra trips and spend more on fuel.
Now, the Illinois food giant is part of a coalition of 150 companies lobbying Congress to allow trucks that are 20% heavier on U.S. highways. Supporters of the idea say truckers could pay an extra fee to offset road repairs.
There is an arms race of sorts in the shipping industry—and it is prompting a backlash. Efforts are under way to supersize trucks, trains, and cargo ships as freight haulers look to move more goods in fewer trips.
Driving the trend are rising fuel costs, an emphasis on reducing carbon footprints and capacity constraints created during the recession as freight movers scaled down, said Paul Bingham, managing director of transportation markets for the research firm IHS Global Insights.


BofA Ex-CEO Denies Fraud Charges
NEW YORK—Former Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis filed an aggressive response to a civil fraud lawsuit from New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, calling the attorney general's case "implausible" and "an ill-founded attempt to lay blame where it does not belong."
The defense was more combative than similar filings from the other co-defendants: the Charlotte, N.C., bank and executive Joseph Price. Mr. Lewis's response signals that the former CEO doesn't plan to back down from charges that he deliberately misled Bank of America shareholders about ballooning losses at Merrill Lynch & Co. before the bank bought the securities firm.
The responses, filed in New York state court, are a reminder that banks are still actively confronting the wreckage, both legal and financial, from the financial crisis. Bank of America ultimately agreed to buy Merrill in 2008 in part due to pressure from U.S. regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the bank over a lack of disclosure on the Merrill deal. The bank eventually paid a fine of $150 million.
The bank is more likely than Mr. Lewis to settle the charges at some point as it seeks to put a variety of legal headaches behind it, said a person close to the situation. Mr. Lewis, on the other hand, "is getting advice to stand strong on this one," said a person close to Mr. Lewis. "He believes it is wrong, and he believes he will be tarnished forever."
Mr. Cuomo's current run for governor of New York State also benefits Mr. Lewis, this person said, because the next attorney general may not be as interested in the case if Mr. Cuomo advances. "Time is to his advantage," this person said.


Councilman From Queens Dies
Councilman Thomas White Jr., who dedicated his professional life to improving his community in southeast Queens, died Friday following a battle with cancer. He was 71 years old.
Mr. White, chairman of the council's economic development committee, "searched for ways to break the cycle of poverty and violence," said City Council Speaker Christine Quinn in a statement.
"He had a particular soft spot for women and minority business owners, pushing for additional resources to help them stay afloat and create good jobs," Ms. Quinn said.
To fill Mr. White's seat, a special nonpartisan election will be held Nov. 2. The winner will be seated immediately and hold the office through Dec. 31, 2011. A primary and general election will be held next year for the right to serve the remainder of Mr. White's unexpired term, which ends Dec. 31, 2013.

Pakistan Base Near U.S. Office Attacked
PESHAWAR, Pakistan—Armed militants launched an attack on military barracks close to the U.S. consulate in Peshawar early Saturday, local government officials said, as violence continued despite massive flooding that has destabilized the nation over the past month.
The attack did not appear to be on the consulate, which was targeted in April, said a U.S. spokesman at the embassy in Islamabad. No U.S. citizens or locals working for the consulate were injured in the attack on Saturday, he said.
Armed gunmen appeared to attack army barracks near the consulate. A firefight between militants and security forces continued in to the late morning, eyewitnesses said. The army and police sealed off the area.
Military spokesman Major Gen. Athar Abbas told local television that armed terrorists entered a government building and took two security guards hostage. "The security forces have encircled the building where the terrorists are holed up and [and] the security forces are trying to ensure the safe release of the hostaged guards," he said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties on either side.


Canada Detains Fourth Terror Suspect
OTTAWA—Police here are continuing to hold a man described by a federal prosecutor as a fourth suspect in a widening Canadian terrorism probe.
The man, who was arrested Friday, hasn't been charged with terrorism-related offenses. Instead, he appeared in court Saturday on domestic-violence charges, was released on bail, then immediately rearrested and detained on a separate charge of uttering threats, according to his lawyer. He is expected to appear in court again Sunday morning.
The man cannot be identified under a court-imposed publication ban, a standard condition of domestic violence hearings in Canada.
Police wouldn't confirm whether the man is also a suspect in a year-long terrorism probe, dubbed project Samosa. But he was initially detained by the RCMP unit handling that probe, and his arrest came a day after the unit charged three men with terrorist activities in a sweep that uncovered videos, schematics and manuals on bombing-building in their homes. In one home, police found some 50 remote-control detonators for improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.
The main Ottawa prosecutor in the terrorism case against the three other men characterized the Friday arrest as a "fourth arrest."


In Sacramento, Debate and Theatrics but No Budget
SACRAMENTO, Calif. – California's legislators aren't close to passing a budget to save the state from the imminent prospect of issuing IOUs. But they did put up a good show today.
Democratic lawmakers offered a tax-raising plan to close a $19 billion shortfall. Republicans countered with a plan for big spending cuts.
The two sides debated for a while. Then they voted on the two proposals, which both failed on party-line votes. Substantial budget negotiations are expected to later this month.
GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, at an event in San Francisco, called the statehouse antics "kabuki."
The theatrics are the latest evidence of California's dysfunctional government. The state has gone without a budget since the fiscal year began July 1. Each passing day brings the state closer to insolvency and IOUs, which the state controller said could come as soon as next week.


Books on the Progressive Era
1. Twenty Years at Hull House
By Jane Addams
Macmillan, 1910
Social and political activist Jane Addams penned this book in her 50th year, aiming to "trace the experiences through which various conclusions were forced upon me." As that vow suggests, the memoir overlooks Addams's agency at every turn, so that the reader has little sense of her accomplishments. With the observant eye of a novelist, Addams attends instead to her confusions and self-doubts and the struggles of those who lived in the working-class neighborhood of her Chicago settlement house, a forerunner of the community center. She describes her anguish over the violence used to put down strikes, and she relates stories about neighbors' frustrations with the problems of poverty. Along the way, Addams enlists the reader's imagination to teach lessons from human experience. In seeking to bridge the class divide, this memoir was in itself an act of reform.


Tawfik Hamid: A Muslim Response to Quran Burning
It's unclear whether or not the Rev. Terry Jones will go ahead with his highly publicized Quran burning this evening in Florida. But Muslims can play a major role in preventing a violent response to any burnings of their holy book.
Islamic scholars can emphasize that the Quran clearly teaches that no one can be punished on account of the actions of others (surra 6, verse 164). In other words, it is against the value system of the Quran to punish Americans or Christians because of the acts of a small minority.
In addition, leading Islamic authorities should issue a powerful fatwa against those who might respond to Quran burning with violence against non-Muslims. The fatwa must clearly state that those who react by carrying out violent acts against non-Muslims are apostates. It should also say that those who attack non-Muslims to seek revenge will not be buried with Muslims and will go to hell forever.
These are the kind of words—unfortunately—that resonate with Islamic radicals. Fatwas that simply condemn violent acts as 'un-Islamic' are too weak to produce any significant effect.
The best example for Muslims to follow in this case is what the Quran says about Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) when his father threatened to stone him to death for refusing to follow the pagan beliefs common in their society. The response of Abraham—who the Quran calls "the role model of all prophets"—was not revenge, but rather an offering of peace (19:46-47). "Dost thou hate my gods, O Ibrahim? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a long while!" says the father. To this, Abraham replies: "Peace be upon thee! I shall ask my Sustainer to forgive thee. For behold, He has always been kind unto me."


Clinton Pushes on Core Mideast Issues
SHANNON, Ireland—Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to push Israelis and Palestinians to move quickly toward resolving the core issues required to establish an independent Palestinian state, as a second round of direct Middle East peace talks commences Tuesday in Egypt.
Mrs. Clinton also said she would press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend a partial moratorium on Jewish construction in the West Bank beyond its Sept. 26 expiration date, as a means to underpin the broader peace process.
But the secretary of state indicated that Washington doesn't believe the status of the building freeze should be a potential deal-breaker for the direct talks.
Rather, she said the U.S. is seeking clear signals this week from both the Israelis and Palestinians that they're preparing to move quickly towards addressing the so-called final-status issues required to establish a Palestinian state.
Mrs. Clinton particularly cited the need to reach agreement rapidly on the future borders of the state, as a means to diminish the importance of any future Jewish construction in disputed areas.


Madoff Trustee's Legal Fees Approved
A federal judge on Tuesday approved $37.6 million in legal fees in connection with the liquidation of Bernard Madoff's investment firm, over the objections of some victims of Mr. Madoff's multibillion dollar Ponzi scheme.
Judge Burton Lifland, of U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, signed off on trustee Irving Picard's request for $5,010 in average daily compensation for himself for work from Feb. 1 to May 31 and another $283,179.45 a day for his law firm, Baker & Hostetler LLP. In addition to the $34.6 million for Mr. Picard and his firm, the judge approved another $3 million for 10 other law firms in the U.S. and abroad.
Some victims called the fees excessive. Others argued that Mr. Picard had a conflict of interest because he is paid by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. while making decisions on insurance payments the group must make to Madoff victims.
Judge Lifland had rejected victims' objections in approving legal fees in the case on three previous occasions.

Rwanda Won't Pull Peacekeepers, President Says
NEW YORK—Rwandan President Paul Kagame on Thursday backed away from a threat to withdraw his country's troops from a peacekeeping mission in Sudan if the United Nations published a report accusing Rwandan soldiers of genocide in neighboring Congo in the late 1990s.
"That is not on the table," Mr. Kagame said in an interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Mr. Kagame said he had never made such a "threat," but added that if the U.N. decided to pursue the report's allegations in a court, he would reconsider.
The 509-page report by the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights was leaked in August, setting off a diplomatic crisis.
Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo, who called the charges "absurd," said in a letter to the U.N. following the leak that "attempts to take action on this report—either through its release or leaks to the media— .. will force us to withdraw from Rwanda's various commitments to the United Nations, especially in the area of peacekeeping."
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon flew to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, earlier this month to plead with Mr. Kagame not to pull the country's 3,000 troops out of Sudan just months before a crucial referendum on independence for southern Sudan. Diplomats fear war could break out if the referendum isn't held and the south declares unilateral independence. The withdrawal of Rwandan troops from the 20,000-strong hybrid U.N.-African Union peace force could further destabilize the country, U.N officials said.


Ed Miliband to Lead U.K. Labour Party
Ed Miliband was elected as the new leader of Britain's Labour Party, beating his more centrist brother David as he promised a less aggressive approach to tackling Britain's record deficit.‬‪
In a heavily union-backed campaign the man sometimes nicknamed "Red Ed" advocated a clear break from the promarket and pro-U.S. policies of Tony Blair's New Labour movement. Relatively unknown across Britain, Mr. Miliband, who will replace former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as Labour leader, pitched himself as "the candidate of profound change," calling on the party to focus on winning back estranged traditional voters and reconnect with trade unions.‬‪
On Saturday, Mr. Miliband promised to "change" and "unite" a party that suffered defeat on the May election and has been riven by factionalism in recent years. "Today the work of a new generation begins," he said. Mr. Miliband edged a 1.3-percentage-point margin over his brother, having won the backing of the unions.
But in a mark of how far Mr. Blair has changed the party, few are expecting anything but a leftward lean away from the formula that won the once socialist party's 13 years of power.‬‪
"Ed very much has positioned himself rather cleverly [on the left] but he left himself studiously ambiguous at all the right moments," said Professor Steven Fielding, an expert on the Labour Party at the University of Nottingham.‬"It will be business as usual, but they'll drop the 'New' from Labour," he said.‬‪


Calif. Budget Deal Headed for Vote
California's statehouse leaders said they reached an agreement on a budget that would close a $19.1 billion shortfall for the fiscal year ending next June.
They didn't immediately release details of the deal, which comes after a three-month delay.
California requires a two-thirds vote by lawmakers to pass a budget, which has recently led to routine delays. The agreement signals that the state's longest-ever budget impasse could soon come to a close, with lawmakers set to vote this week on the revised budget, which was due when the fiscal year began in July.
"We've reached an agreement, and there will be a vote on the budget Thursday," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote on Twitter.
Rank and file legislators don't always follow their leaders' recommendation, though. Last year, budget talks dragged on well past when the governor and legislative leaders struck a deal, triggering marathon sessions until a final deal was reached.


In North Korea Photos, a General Trend
The biggest winner of this week's North Korea leadership shuffle—apart from Kim Jong Il's son, who is being positioned to take over the authoritarian regime's leadership—appears to be a little-known general whose several promotions have put him at the literal center of the country's political elite.
The general, Ri Yong Ho, sat between Kim Jong Il and his son, Kim Jong Eun, in an official photo of nearly 300 officials that was taken at the end of the high-profile meeting of the ruling Workers' Party. The image promises to be studied by intelligence agencies and scholars against previous occasional "class photos" of the Pyongyang elite for clues about who is up and who is down in the secretive regime.
Mr. Ri's proximity to the two Kims in the photo, in addition to his new titles, signals that he has likely been chosen to guide the military in a transition of power to the younger Kim if Kim Jong Il dies or becomes incapacitated, analysts said Friday.
"He was supportive of the idea to promote the son and will be instrumental in securing his position," said Leonid Petrov, a Korean specialist at the University of Sydney in Australia.
Mr. Kim appointed both his son and Mr. Ri as vice chairmen of the party's Central Military Commission.


Blasts Hit Nigeria Festivities, Killing 7
LAGOS, Nigeria—At least seven people were killed and 38 injured when two car bombs exploded in Nigeria Friday while hundreds of dignitaries, including the president, celebrated the country's 50th anniversary a few hundred yards away, according to police and Red Cross officials.
"It was a chaotic scene, and victims were taken to several different hospitals," Nigerian Red Cross spokesman Umar Mairiga said. "We're now going around the hospitals trying to see if there are any more victims. The hospitals are very short of blood supply."
"We are on top of it now," national police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said. "Our investigation will show what happened and who was behind it."
A militant group known for attacking oil infrastructure in the impoverished Niger Delta region claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had given Nigerian security officials 24 hours' notice, according to a spokesman for the group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.


Hispanic Turnout at Midterms in Doubt
Hispanic voters' allegiance to the Democratic Party remains strong, according to a survey released Tuesday, but they are significantly less motivated than other voters to cast a ballot in the Nov. 2 elections, which could help Republican candidates.
Two-thirds of Latino registered voters said they plan to support a Democratic candidate in a congressional race, according to the survey by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center.
However, the Washington, D.C., research group found only half of Latino registered voters were certain they would vote in the midterm elections, compared with 70% of all registered U.S. voters who said they plan to vote. In the 2006 midterm election, 71% of registered voters said they cast a ballot.
Half of all U.S. registered voters surveyed said they have thought "quite a lot" about next month's elections. Among Latinos that figure is 32%, according to the poll, which was conducted between Aug. 17 and Sept. 19.
Hispanic support for Democratic candidates held up even though only 26% of those surveyed said President Barack Obama's policies have helped Latinos. Another 13% said administration policies have harmed Latinos; 51% said they had no impact.


French Minister Warns of Terror Threat
PARIS—Saudi intelligence services have warned of a new terror threat from al-Qaida in Europe, "notably France," Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said Sunday.
He said the warning of a potential attack by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was received "in the last few hours, few days."
Europeans were informed that "al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was doubtless active or envisioned being active" on the "European continent, notably France," Hortefeux said during a joint TV and radio interview.
"The threat is real," he said on RTL-LCI-Le Figaro's weekly talk show.
The word of a potential attack by Islamist radicals is the latest in a series of warnings after alerts from the international police organization Interpol and the United States.


A Foreclosure Sitcom
First we learned America's biggest banks couldn't properly lend.
Then we learned they couldn't keep themselves solvent without taxpayer assistance. Then we learned they couldn't effectively work with troubled borrowers in a bursting housing bubble. And now we've learned they don't even know how to foreclose.
Last week, attorneys general from 50 states launched investigations into the defective and fraudulent paperwork banks have been filing in courts as they foreclose their bad loans across the land. Banks have been caught deploying "robo-signers" who sign off on thousands of documents and affidavits without even so much as looking at them.
This is more than just a little paperwork problem. Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray put it best: "This is about the private-property rights of homeowners facing foreclosure and the integrity of our court system, which cannot enter judgments based on fraudulent evidence."
Imagine losing your home and then another bank says it wants to foreclose on you, too. "But I was already foreclosed," you might say. And the bank might say, "Whoops. The court gave your house to the wrong bank."


China Anoints Its Next Leader
BEIJING—China's Communist Party appointed Vice President Xi Jinping to a key military post, cementing his status as heir apparent to president and party chief Hu Jintao and removing much of the uncertainty surrounding the country's leadership succession.
The appointment comes at a pivotal time for China as its economic and military might grows. Many inside and outside the party will now be looking for signals as to whether Mr. Xi stands closer to Premier Wen Jiabao and others who appear to be pushing political reform, or to more conservative leaders, thought to include President Hu.
Mr. Xi, the 57-year-old son of a revolutionary hero, was appointed a vice chairman of the party's Central Military Commission at a secretive annual party meeting in a hotel in Beijing that ended Monday. The commission controls China's two-million-strong army and is headed by Mr. Hu, who is due to step down as Communist Party general secretary in 2012 and as president in 2013.
Mr. Xi, who is married to a hugely popular folk singer, is among a generation of Chinese leaders who grew up during China's traumatic Cultural Revolution and whose careers have coincided with the country's meteoric rise since economic reforms were launched in 1979.
A portly figure sometimes criticized for lacking charisma, Mr. Xi has maintained a low public profile, though on a visit to Mexico last year he openly mocked foreign attitudes toward China.


Immorality and Insulation in Louisiana
Democrats thought they were dealt an unbeatable hand to pick up a Republican Senate seat in Louisiana. The conservative incumbent, David Vitter, was revealed to have been a name in the client book of an infamous D.C. Madam back in 2007. Mr. Vitter admitted "a very serious sin."
But the hand isn't playing out as expected. Mr. Vitter not only managed to withstand a Republican primary challenge that focused on his "sin." With a weekend to go, Democratic Rep. Charlie Melancon hasn't done any better pounding the same theme. He now lags in most polls by double digits.
Rehearsing the definition of insanity, Mr. Melancon is doubling down in the final days. A new Melancon ad turns Mr. Vitter's apology against him, closing with the line, "The real sin is that David Vitter is still a senator." All along, Mr. Melancon has tried to rally women by insinuating that Mr. Vitter is soft on rape. A new radio spot features Jennie Waldrop, a rape victim who once confronted Mr. Vitter in a public forum. Ms. Waldrop says: "At a town hall, I asked him, 'How could you support a law that denies victims like me the right to defend myself?' He told me I didn't know what I was talking about and then he walked away. I never thought I'd get involved in politics, but David Vitter is a man unfit to be my Senator."
What happened at the town hall is that Mr. Vitter told Ms. Waldrop that she had mischaracterized the amendment in question and further noted that the Obama administration had opposed it too.
Hardly a voter must exist in Louisiana who hasn't heard of Mr. Vitter's "sin," but voters apparently are more interested in electing whoever will oppose the Obama agenda. Republicans and Mr. Vitter in particular ought to send the White House a thank-you note. Mr. Melancon's relentless attempts to localize the race have only proved how utterly this year's contests have been nationalized as a referendum on the president.


Out of Yemen, a Top Al Qaeda Threat
SAN'A, Yemen—The scope and sophistication of Friday's apparent attempt to deliver explosive-laden parcels to the United States casts renewed attention on al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate— which has drawn Yemen's government, with U.S. backing, into an increasingly bloody ground war.
Some U.S. officials see this al Qaeda branch, known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as a critical threat to U.S. security—on par with the one from Osama bin Laden's group, presumed to be operating along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
Al Qaeda members in Yemen claimed responsibility for the 2000 bombing of the U.S. warship Cole in the southern port of Aden that killed 17 sailors, and for the failed attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner last Christmas. U.S. officials also say American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who they accuse of being a top member of the Arabian group, had links to the army major who allegedly shot and killed 13 people at Food Hood in Texas last year.
In the past year, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Salah has announced a renewed determination to deny the terrorist group a base in Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden and a recruiting zone for al Qaeda since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Yemen's foreign ministry recently said it believes the group now numbers about 400 militants.
Yemeni and U.S. forces have been trying to shave down the Yemen branch's reach with a wide-scale local military campaign this summer across two mountainous provinces in the country's south, where the group has long had sanctuary living among Yemen's tribes.


Court Pares Convictions Against Black In Fraud Case
A federal appeals court on Friday upheld parts of former media mogul Conrad Black's fraud conviction, which was called into question by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.
Last June, the high court revived Lord Black's legal challenge by narrowing the reach of a federal law that gave prosecutors the authority to bring cases against executives who deprive companies of their "honest services." The justices ordered the lower courts to take another look at Lord Black's conviction.
But on Friday, the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a jury would have convicted Lord Black anyway on some counts, and affirmed his conviction on one fraud count and an obstruction-of-justice charge.
The court said the Supreme Court ruling required that another part of Lord Black's conviction be reversed. Prosecutors have the option to retry Lord Black on that charge, the court said, but it suggested that the government consider not doing so. It sent the case back to a trial judge for resentencing.
Prosecutors had alleged that Lord Black, the former chairman of Hollinger International Inc., and other executives supported lavish lifestyles by siphoning off millions from the company through bogus management fees and noncompetition agreements as Hollinger sold off many of its smaller newspapers.


Potential Award for Terra Firma Sharply Reduced
The potential damages that could be awarded to Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. in its fraud suit against Citigroup Inc. has been reduced by almost three quarters, highlighting the risks the case carries for the buyout firm and its founder Guy Hands.
Terra Firma sued Citigroup for allegedly duping it into overpaying for EMI Group PLC, the music company it bought in 2007. Jed Rakoff, the federal judge presiding over the case in a Manhattan court, on Wednesday threw out one of three premises underpinning Terra Firma's claim for roughly $7.5 billion in damages, and requested that the firm's lawyers withdraw another, which they did.
As a result, the most the private-equity firm stands to gain should the jury rule in its favor is roughly $2 billion—the difference between what it paid for EMI and what it argues the music company was actually worth then.
It is conceivable that when Mr. Rakoff sends the matter to the jury on Wednesday, he could lower the potential damages even further.
A spokesman for Terra Firma had no comment on the lowering of the damages.


U.S. Seeks to Shut Massey Mine
Federal safety officials took the unprecedented step of seeking a court injunction to shut a Massey Energy Co. coal mine that had hundreds of safety violations, saying the mine was unsafe to operate.
Richmond-based Massey has been the focus of greater regulatory oversight following the April accident that killed 29 workers at its Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W.Va., in the worst coal-mining accident in 40 years.
The Labor Department filed a preliminary injunction Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky to close Massey's Freedom Mine No. 1 in Pike County, Ky., until safety hazards are addressed.
Federal officials say they issued nearly 2,000 citations between July 2008 and June 2010 for safety violations at the mine. They also noted that six major roof falls had occurred since August, 2010 at the mine, which employs about 130 miners. "If the court does not step in someone may be seriously injured or die," said Joseph A. Main, head of the agency.
"Massey does not believe the mine is unsafe," the company said in a statement. Massey said the large, older mine has struggled to comply with newer federal safety standards. It is considering idling the mine until it can meet those standards, Massey added.


Yemeni al Qaeda Claims Bomb Attempts
WASHINGTON—Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has claimed responsibility for last week's thwarted plot to send bombs in packages to the United States, the monitoring Web site SITE said.
In a message posted on Jihadist Web sites monitored by SITE, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, called for more attacks on both civilian and cargo flights.
A U.S. counterterrorism official said there were "very strong indications" that AQAP was responsible for plotting last week's cargo plane plot. A Saudi tip led authorities to the unexploded packages in cargo planes in the U.K. and Dubai.
In the Web posting, AQAP also claimed responsibility for a Sept. 3 crash of a UPS Inc. cargo plane in Dubai. U.S. investigators had said they found no evidence of terrorist involvement in that incident.
A U.S. official said U.S. authorities were taking another look at the Dubai crash but "nothing thus far has indicated any nexus to terrorism."


Russian Reporter in Coma After Attack
A prominent Russia journalist known for his critical reports on pro-Kremlin youth groups was in a coma Saturday morning after being severely beaten, an assault his colleagues link to his reporting work.
It is the latest case of such attacks in Russia, which is considered one of the most dangerous places for journalists. Oleg Kashin, 30 years old, was assaulted in the early hours of the morning near his home in the center of Moscow.
According to Mr. Kashin's neighbor, who quoted a witness, he was attacked by two men who waited for him with a bunch of flowers to look less suspicious.
Doctors induced a coma after the journalist was admitted to a local hospital with a severe concussion, broken legs, fractured jaw and damaged skull. Police opened a criminal investigation.
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev was informed of the accident and ordered his interior minister to take control of the investigation.


Lawmakers Aim to Spare Taxpayers From AMT
WASHINGTON—Democratic and Republican leaders of congressional tax committees said Tuesday they will work to ensure that "not one additional taxpayer" will pay the alternative minimum tax in 2010.
A temporary fix for the AMT is one of several tax issues on the agenda for Congress's lame-duck session, which begins Monday.
Lawmakers of both parties wrote Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Doug Shulman, indicating they plan to enact legislation protecting as many as 24 million taxpayers from a tax increase due to the AMT.
Taxpayers who pay the AMT face higher tax bills than under the regular income tax, because the tax was designed to limit the benefit of some credits and deductions.
Moreover, because the AMT was not indexed for inflation, it has the potential to hit a growing number of taxpayers each year. But Congress historically has enacted temporary "patches" that allow most to escape the tax.


Tanzanian Man Duped in Embassy Plot, Lawyer Says
NEW YORK—A Tanzanian man was duped by people he thought were his friends and didn't know they planned to explode two truck bombs outside U.S. embassies in east Africa in 1998, his lawyer said Tuesday.
In his closing statement, Peter Quijano, a lawyer for Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, said Mr. Ghailani was trying to become a businessman and simply engaged in "benign business transactions" in the open markets in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan have alleged Mr. Ghailani, now 36, was an active member of a plot to bomb U.S. embassies in Tanzania and in Nairobi, Kenya, including buying a truck and materials used in one of the bombings.
"He's not a political kid. He's not a religious kid," Mr. Quijano said. "He's just trying to make a shilling."
Mr. Ghailani is the first detainee from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to face trial in the U.S. His case is seen as a major test for the Obama administration's plan to try some detainees who have been held at Guantanamo in civilian courts rather than before military tribunals.


Singh Vows Action On Graft
NEW DELHI--Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday said wrongdoers in a spate of recent alleged scandals would be severely dealt with as India's capital remains gripped by a rare unearthing of graft allegations and an accompanying debate over ethics in public life.
"There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that if anything wrong was done by anybody, he or she will be brought to book," Mr. Singh said in response to a question at a conference about how he intends to handle what is turning into the biggest crisis of his six years in office. In a speech at the same event, Mr. Singh acknowledged these were testing times for him. "As prime minister, I feel like a high school student, going from one test to another," he said. And he said that if India wants to continue its sustained economic growth, "We need to deal effectively with the threats of corruption and crony capitalism – not only in India but all over the world."
Widespread graft has been a staple of Delhi political life for decades but three recent scandals have made corruption an all-consuming topic here and prompted a pointed debate about whether India, as its economy roars ahead and its stature increases on the world stage, can become more transparent or will forever be mired in a culture of corruption.
"In one and a half months, corruption has boiled over to the point of inflection," said Amit Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a business group. "This is a new wave of hitting something that we had failed to hit so far – corruption at the highest circles, at the ministerial level. I don't think it's ever happened in India's history."
The first scandal was the mishandling and alleged corruption concerning the run-up to the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi last month, which forced the resignation earlier this month of Suresh Kalmadi, chairman of the Games organizing committee, from a Parliamentary post for the ruling Congress party. The second was an alleged housing scam in Mumbai where apartments intended for veterans and widows were allocated to powerful politicians and their kin, forcing the resignation of the chief minister of the state of Maharashtra.


Pyongyang Tests China's Patience
BEIJING—North Korea's latest act of aggression against the South has prompted a new round of public debate in China on how to manage ties with a neighbor that is at once a close ally but, increasingly, a source of international embarrassment.
The government's official response to North Korea's shelling of a South Korean island village remains cautious, stopping well short of criticism of the North.
In comments reported Thursday, Premier Wen Jiabao said China opposes "any provocative military behavior" on the Korean peninsula. Mr. Wen was speaking in Russia as the U.S. and South Korea prepare for joint naval exercises in the Yellow Sea in response to the deadly attack. But it wasn't clear whether his warning referred to North Korea's attack, or to the South Korean exercises Pyongyang claims to have responded to, or to the planned naval drills between the U.S. and South Korea.
Mr. Wen called the standoff between Seoul and Pyongyang a "severely complicated situation," according to a statement posted on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website. He called for "all relevant parties to exercise the utmost restraint," and said "the international community should do more work to ease the tension of the situation."
Among Chinese foreign-policy circles and general citizens, there are growing signs of exasperation with Pyongyang's behavior. Some question how Beijing benefits from its old Communist ally's recent provocations


Brazil Sends Soldiers to Rio's Slums
SÃO PAULO, Brazil—President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva deployed 800 soldiers to reinforce police battling heavily-armed gangs in the hillside shanty towns of Rio de Janeiro, where soccer's 2014 World Cup championship and the 2016 summer Olympic Games will be held.
The arrival of the soldiers, who officials say will take up positions around the entrances to shanty towns where gang members are believed to be hiding, gave a boost of confidence to city officials struggling to contain a week of violence that's left at least 25 dead and around 100 vehicles burned.
"What we are showing to people who don't respect the law, who live by crime, is that the democratic state took control, the democratic state is asserting itself fully," Rio de Janeiro state Governor Sergio Cabral said at a news conference Friday where he was joined by the nation's minister of defense, Nelson Jobim.
The violence has raised questions about safety as Rio—which has among the world's highest murder rates—prepares to host major international sports events. Organizers of the
2016 Olympics issued a statement of support for the city's law-enforcement efforts.


Meth Labs Make Return to U.S.
Federal drug agents are reporting a resurgence of methamphetamine production in such areas as rural California and suburban Georgia—a consequence, they suspect, of meth crackdowns in Mexico.
The resurgence over the past two years comes after more than a decade of falling U.S. meth production, and may signal a return to the days when toxic meth byproducts littered roadsides and polluted waterways across rural America.
Illicit meth labs declined after U.S. laws curbed the availability of ingredients needed to manufacture the drug, a potent and highly addictive stimulant. As large-scale production, especially in the West, moved to Mexico, many U.S. dealers began importing Mexican meth.
Now, in a setback to efforts to curb unlawful drugs, meth labs are back on the rise in places like Riverside. Once a hotbed of meth production, this desert county saw a decline in production over the past 15 years. But officials there have busted 15 meth labs this year, up more than 30% from last year and the most since 2007, according to the Riverside Sheriff's office.
On Thursday, San Francisco police also raided a meth lab in the city's tony Laurel Heights neighborhood. Earlier this week, federal and state agents raided a suburban Atlanta meth lab and found hundreds of pounds of the drug, one of the biggest busts in recent years. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, officials in Georgia busted 125 labs last year, up from 85 in 2008 and 68 in 2007.


We Should Leave Africa's Development to the Africans
While Bill Gates and Matt Ridley bring interesting conversation to the table in their essays ("Gates vs. Ridley: Africa Needs Aid, Not Flawed Theories" and "Africa Needs Growth, Not Pity and Big Plans," Review, Nov. 27), I'm afraid they have no clue on how Africa or other "underdeveloped" countries can significantly better the lives of their citizens.
Western countries have been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into Africa for decades, and these investments have done far more damage than good. Underdeveloped nations in Africa and elsewhere will begin to prosper only when they: throw off tyranny and adopt constitutions similar to that of the U.S. and other enlightened democracies; hold free and open elections that promote the interest of the majority; protect property rights so that producers can invest and create employment and profits; establish a police force and judiciary that will protect free-enterprise, property and civil rights; encourage an educational system that provides young people with marketable skills and an understanding of their civic responsibilities; and build a banking system that promotes stable currencies and available credit to responsible entrepreneurs and investors.
Are these objectives difficult or far-fetched? Indeed they are, but less so than the opinions of Messrs. Ridley and Gates. We must treat our less fortunate Third World brothers and sisters as equals (rather than ignorant children) if they're ever going to realize the marvelous gifts of prosperity and liberty that have taken us so many centuries to accomplish.

South Korean City Thrives Near DMZ
PAJU, South Korea—In April, Lee Woo-young moved with her family into a fancy high-rise apartment complex here, just six miles from the demilitarized zone that divides South Korea from the impoverished and heavily armed North.
Ms. Lee's new home is within range of North Korean artillery batteries dug in on the other side of the Imjin River. But she says she isn't worried, even after last month's shelling of a South Korean island by the North that killed four people.
"I don't really feel like there's a threat here," says Ms. Lee, 32 years old, her 3-year-old son playing nearby. She chose the neighborhood, she says, because "it has clean air and it's a good place to raise a kid."
This booming city—which abuts the DMZ—and its swelling population show how South Koreans in many ways have become inured to the threat posed by the North and discount the possibility of war with their neighbor.
Paju's success also complicates the calculus for South Korea's leaders as they weigh how to respond to attacks by North Korea and helps explain Seoul's caution so far. South Korea's people fear a conflict that could destroy the well-off, modern nation they have built.


Madoff Figure Struggles to Make Bail
NEW YORK—A longtime back-office employee of convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff has been unable to meet some of the conditions related to her $5 million bail and could be remanded to jail as soon as Thursday afternoon.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused Annette Bongiorno, 62 years old, of playing a key role in deceiving investors and regulators and helping prop up Mr. Madoff's decades-long fraud. She was indicted last month, along with JoAnn "Jodi" Crupi, another longtime Madoff back-office employee. They have denied wrongdoing.
About $2 million in cash and in property has been put up to secure the bond. However, Ms. Bongiorno's lawyers have had difficulty finding enough co-signers who have the financial means to cover her bond if she were to flee because of the notoriety of the case.
Another issue the bail process is her access to $2.4 million in "liquid assets." Her lawyers have been unwilling to reveal where those assets are because prosecutors have indicated they will seize them and she won't be able to use that money for her defense.
On Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Julian Moore also revealed that Ms. Bongiorno's husband had withdrawn more than $3 million from an account held in his name at the Madoff firm since the mid-1980s. It was unclear how much he might have access to.


BofA Bans WikiLeaks Transactions
Bank of America Corp. , thought to be a potential target of WikiLeaks, became the latest U.S. company to ban transactions of "any type that we have reason to believe are intended for WikiLeaks," the bank said in a statement.
"This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments," said the statement.
WikiLeaks urged followers to respond to the bank's decision, saying via a Twitter feed on Friday evening "that all people who love freedom close out their accounts at Bank of America." In another Friday evening post it said: "place your funds somewhere safer."
MasterCard had its web site shut down for several hours after enduring attacks from WikiLeaks supporters. There was no evidence Sunday of any similar disruption to Bank of America's site. A bank spokesman declined further comment Sunday.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said this year he is planning a release of information about a major U.S. bank. Analysts have speculated Bank of America is the likely target, citing Mr. Assange's previous claim that he had the 5G computer hard drive of a Bank of America executive.


CBI Grills Raja in Telecom Case
NEW DELHI -- India's Central Bureau of Investigation Friday began questioning former Telecommunications Minister Andimuthu Raja in connection with alleged irregularities in the allotment of telecom licenses and bandwidth, an official with the federal investigating agency said.
The official, who declined to be identified, didn't elaborate.
The CBI, India's top investigation agency, served a notice on Mr. Raja Monday.
Indian investigators are scrutinizing the government's 2008 sale of telecom licenses and bandwidth, a process that critics say favored some companies and which a federal auditor said lost the government up to $40 billion in potential revenue because the bandwidth was priced far below its market value.
Mr. Raja was telecom minister in 2008 when the licenses and bandwidth were allocated. He resigned last month in a storm of criticism and mounting allegations of corruption during the allotment.


Bloomberg's Reputation Takes a Hit
NEW YORK—Mayor Michael Bloomberg has started the new year with his reputation as a first-class manager suddenly in question after a post-Christmas snowstorm left New York paralyzed for days.
Critics of Mr. Bloomberg say his administration's sluggish response to the Dec. 26-27 blizzard—coming on the heels of a scandal involving the theft of $80 million from the city's long-delayed computerized payroll system—may have damaged the mayor's legacy.
A NY1-Marist poll conducted Wednesday showed Mr. Bloomberg with a 37% approval rating, his lowest since taking office in January 2002. More than seven in 10 disapproved of the mayor's handling of last week's snow removal.
"Obviously, he's concerned about his legacy, as anyone would be, and this [snowstorm] will have a big effect on that," said City Council member Peter Vallone, a Democrat who crossed party lines to endorse the Republican-turned-independent Mr. Bloomberg in 2009.
The mayor said last week the city's response to the storm was "inadequate" and "unacceptable." But he added that there were an "awful lot of good numbers out there" about the city's progress, and he was proud overall of his administration's accomplishments.


Man Arrested for Allegedly Threatening Lawmaker
The Justice Department filed a criminal complaint in Seattle federal court Wednesday against a California man for allegedly making threatening phone calls to U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott's office.
Charles Habermann, a Palm Springs, Calif. man, allegedly made two "expletive-laden, threatening phone calls" to the Seattle office of Mr. McDermott (D., Wash.). The 32-year-old Mr. Habermann allegedly threatened to kill Mr. McDermott, his friends and his family and to put the congressman "in the trash."
Authorities said Mr. Habermann was arrested Wednesday. Neither he nor an attorney for him could be reached for comment.
The charge against Mr. Habermann comes only days after Saturday's shootings in Tucson, Ariz., in which six people were killed and 14 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head. Jared Loughner has been charged in Phoenix federal court with murder and attempted murder in that attack, which authorities have said they believe was aimed at Rep. Giffords. She was holding an open meeting for constituents at a shopping center in Tucson.
In the complaint filed in federal court, the government said that in an interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December, Mr. Haberman admitted to leaving threatening voice-mail messages for Rep. McDermott. He said he had been drinking beforehand, according to the complaint, and that he wanted politicians to know he was unhappy with how they were spending taxpayer money and was trying to scare them.


Excerpts: Alassane Ouattara
Read excerpts from The Journal's interview with the Ivory Coast's internationally recognized president, Alassane Ouattara., at the Golf Hotel, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Thursday, Jan. 20, 2011.
"Mediation has not yielded the results we had hoped. Mr. Gbagbo continues to want to be the man in power even though he was not elected. It's clear that this cannot be allowed."
* * *
"The position of [West African regional bloc] Ecowas now should be using other measures, including legitimate force. Clearly military intervention now is necessary, to remove Mr. Gbagbo. I talk to President Jonathan [of Nigeria] two times to a week, and he has given me assurances that we're still on course [for military intervention]. If Mr. Gbagbo does not want to leave, military intervention has been used elsewhere in Africa and Latin America, so why not Cote d'Ivoire?"

Justice Makes Preparatory Cuts
The Justice Department, preparing for a host of proposed cuts from the White House, has begun its own reductions in the hopes of softening the blow.
The department—which saw years of rapid growth after the 2001 terror attacks—is just one of the federal agencies facing significant cutbacks. In recent weeks, Justice Department officials have been negotiating with the White House on details of a proposed budget, even as they brace for possibly tougher reductions from Congress.
According to internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the White House Office of Management and Budget has proposed a number of cost-cutting measures, including:
—Increasing the amount of time deducted from prison sentences for good behavior, which they estimated would save money by immediately qualifying some 4,000 federal convicts for release, and another 4,000 over the next 10 years.
—Eliminating the FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center, for a savings of $8 million.


The Republican Eraser
President Obama sure has moved on, but there are stragglers.
Just one year after bludgeoning Wall Street in his State of the Union address, claiming that "bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded," the tone in Tuesday night's speech represented a move to the center.
"To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of government regulations," he said. Mr. Obama focused on proposals—tax overhaul, competitiveness and regulations—that are aimed broadly at commerce but would indirectly benefit last year's bad guys.
You might think that Wall Street and its advocates on Capitol Hill would take some satisfaction that most of the finger-wagging is over. The bank tax never happened. Congress passed a lukewarm raft of new regulations. It could have been a lot worse.
But you'd be wrong. Key Republicans who were critical when Dodd-Frank was signed into law are complaining even louder now. They want the new laws wiped off the books. And they're hell-bent on doing it, Mr. Obama's move to the center notwithstanding.


Gates Criticizes Congress Over Budget
WASHINGTON—Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates defended his plans to trim the Pentagon budget over the next five years and at the same time criticized Congress for failing to pass a budget for the current year, a move that could force faster, across-the-board cuts in military spending.
In recent days, some Republican lawmakers have criticized Mr. Gates for planning to make a $78 billion in cuts from the previously planned Pentagon budget, a move that would unfold in coming years.
But by funding government under a continuing resolution, rather than passing new spending bills for the current fiscal year, Mr. Gates said the current Congress is forcing up to $23 billion in cuts.
"We have a crisis on our doorstep," he said.
Mr. Gates made his remarks while traveling to Ottawa, Canada, Wednesday, but they weren't released by the Pentagon until Thursday.


White House Supports Airwaves for Public Safety
WASHINGTON—The White House endorsed a plan Thursday to give a chunk of airwaves worth an estimated $3 billion to public-safety groups for a new national wireless public-safety network that could cost as much as $15 billion to build, if Congress approves.
The proposal is part of the administration's plan to make good on a pledge President Barack Obama made during his State of the Union speech Tuesday to make mobile Internet available to 98% of Americans in five years.
White House officials are also expected to ask Congress to set aside billions of dollars in future airwave auctions for a new broadband public-safety network. The network would allow police and firemen to share video and other data during emergencies.
In the past, administration officials have suggested that these beefed-up public-safety networks could be shared by private companies to provide Internet access in rural areas.
White House officials declined to comment on specifics of the new public-safety network plan.


U.K. Delays Bribery Law
LONDON—The U.K. government has delayed implementation of a new antibribery law after businesses voiced concerns over the rules' clarity, specifically which companies would be affected and which actions could be interpreted as bribery.
The Bribery Act was expected to come into effect in April, with guidance from the government about how businesses could comply with it due out around now.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said in a statement the government will release new details on the legislation in "due course."
"We are working on the guidance to make it practical and comprehensive for business," the statement said.
A person familiar with the matter said the delay came after businesses complained about how the new law would work.


Giffords's Husband to Fly on Shuttle
HOUSTON—Astronaut Mark Kelly, who has been on personal leave since his wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was critically wounded in a Jan. 8 shooting rampage, will resume training for a space mission, NASA confirmed Friday.
Rep. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was shot in the head outside a Tucson supermarket, one of 19 shooting victims, but survived and is recovering at the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research at Memorial Hermann Hospital here.
In a prepared statement released Friday, Mr. Kelly said he was "looking forward" to joining his crew members and completing the training for the April 19 launch, already 18 months in the making.
Peggy Whitson, chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA's Johnson Space Center, said in the statement that Mr. Kelly "is a veteran shuttle commander and knows well the demands of the job. We are confident in his ability to successfully lead this mission, and I know I speak for all of NASA in saying, 'Welcome back.' "
Mr. Kelly will discuss his return at a briefing at 2 p.m. CST Friday.


Notable & Quotable
British Prime Minister David Cameron speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
[T]he biggest threat that we face comes from terrorist attacks, some of which are, sadly, carried out by our own citizens. . . .
Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream. We've failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong. We've even tolerated these segregated communities behaving in ways that run completely counter to our values.
So, when a white person holds objectionable views, racist views for instance, we rightly condemn them. But when equally unacceptable views or practices come from someone who isn't white, we've been too cautious frankly—frankly, even fearful—to stand up to them. . . .
Some organizations that seek to present themselves as a gateway to the Muslim community are showered with public money despite doing little to combat extremism. As others have observed, this is like turning to a right-wing fascist party to fight a violent white supremacist movement. So we should properly judge these organizations: do they believe in universal human rights—including for women and people of other faiths? Do they believe in equality of all before the law? Do they believe in democracy and the right of people to elect their own government? Do they encourage integration or separation? . . . Fail these tests and the presumption should be not to engage with organizations—so, no public money, no sharing of platforms with ministers at home.


Russia Lets Journalist Return
MOSCOW—Russian authorities allowed a British journalist who had been denied entry to Moscow a week earlier to return over the weekend, after the incident sparked intervention by U.K. officials and charges the Kremlin was constraining media freedom.
Luke Harding, Moscow correspondent for the Guardian newspaper, said in an email he returned to Russia over the weekend after getting a single-entry visa in London on Friday. Mr. Harding said he had received no explanation or indication of how long he will be allowed to continue working as a journalist in Russia. "We can confirm that Luke Harding returned to Moscow on Saturday," a Guardian spokeswoman said Sunday in a statement. "Russia's foreign ministry has so far not clarified whether he is welcome to work indefinitely as a correspondent in Russia or has to leave the country at the end of May."
Mr. Harding, who had frequently been critical of Kremlin policies in his articles, was denied entry and had his visa annulled by immigration officials on Feb. 5 and was deported to London. After criticism from media-freedom and other groups, as well as intervention by British Foreign Secretary William Hague, Russian officials last week sought to play down the matter, accusing Mr. Harding of violating regulations governing the work of foreign journalists but offering to give him a new visa. Mr. Harding dismissed the alleged violations as pretexts, though U.K. officials suggested he had broken rules. "We are pleased that the Russian authorities have chosen to renew his foreign journalist's accreditation despite his having contravened the Russian government's travel restrictions," a spokeswoman for the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office said on Sunday in a statement. The reissue of the visa comes just days before Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is scheduled to travel to London on a previously scheduled visit. Mr. Harding had written a number of articles about allegations of high-level Kremlin corruption in U.S. diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks. Mr. Harding's expulsion came as the Guardian unveiled "WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy," a book Mr. Harding wrote with the paper's investigative editor, David Leigh.


'Peaceful Transition' Is Egypt's Goal
CAIRO—Egypt's new military rulers indicated Saturday they would abide by the country's peace treaty with Israel and said they aim to ensure a peaceful transition to elections and a "free democratic state."
A day after the ouster of Egypt's longstanding president, Hosni Mubarak, the country's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces issued a communiqué saying the country "is committed to all regional and international obligations and treaties." Those treaties include its 1979 peace agreement with Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the announcement, saying the peace agreement "has greatly contributed to both countries and is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the entire Middle East."
The military rulers said Egypt's current cabinet would remain in power until a new government was formed. They pledged to insure "a peaceful transition of power in the framework of a free and democratic system." The new elected government "will rule the country to build a free democratic state," the statement said. It didn't set a timetable for the transition to democracy.
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood said in a statement posted on its website Saturday that it wasn't seeking power or a majority of parliament seats. The group reiterated its previous assertion that it was only a participant in the Egyptian revolution and that its demands echoed those of the nation. It called on the army to rapidly form a new transitional government, scrap emergency laws, amend the constitution, ensure free elections and free all political detainees.


India: Twenty Years Later
The Indian government's annual budget statement later this month will mark close to 20 years since India finally turned its back on most of the economic policies that had placed it on the edge of an abyss in the early months of 1991.
The dramatic liberalization of that year and further policy changes by governments in the late 1990s were a smashing success in some ways—India has a far more stable economy and is far more prosperous than before. But the failure to push reforms over the past six years, along with the shortcomings of past reforms, tell us a lot about why liberal economic policies have little political resonance in India.
Say what you will about the quality of reforms, India has come a long way since 1991. Back then a profligate government, an uncompetitive and heavily protected economy, high tax rates, an overvalued exchange rate, and sudden capital flight had brought India within 15 days of an embarrassing default on its international loans. In response, the government cut tariffs, did away with industrial licensing and opened the economy up to foreign investment. Though New Delhi is battling similar problems today—a large budget deficit and a wide current account deficit, for instance—the Indian economy is on a much firmer footing thanks to the discipline imposed by those reforms.
These reforms are paying off not only at a macro level but also for individual poor households. Average dollar incomes have more than tripled since 1991. Diets have improved and more proteins are being consumed. School enrollment has soared. Human development indicators increased more in the first decade of the current century than they did in the 1990s. The demand for basic consumer goods is rising. Mobile phones, watches and ceiling fans are common possessions in poor communities.
Yet the so-called 1991 Big Bang, and the reform process since then, left a lot undone. In the past few years especially, the Congress Party-led government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the finance minister who helped introduce many of the most dramatic reforms from 1991-93, has lost its nerve for liberalization. Several important second-generation reforms, like the introduction of a unified goods and services tax that will finally stop distorting the tax incentives of producers, have not progressed since the Congress came to power in 2004.


Early Election Becomes a Possibility in Japan
TOKYO—A snap election in Japan over the next few months has become a possibility in recent days as a rift widens within the ruling party and an emboldened opposition vows to block crucial budget-related legislation.
The latest political crisis for Prime Minister Naoto Kan came Thursday, when 16 lawmakers in his own Democratic Party of Japan said they wanted to form a separate voting bloc within the more-powerful lower house of the Diet, Japan's parliament. The group is loyal to former party leader Ichiro Ozawa, who faces potential expulsion from the DPJ after his indictment on criminal charges in a fund-raising scandal.
Chief government spokesman Yukio Edano said that Mr. Kan isn't thinking about dissolving the lower house "for now," but the premier himself hinted that it is an option, saying on Friday that he will "act based on what is important for the public."
The political turmoil makes the government's top priority in the current session of the Diet—to enact a budget and related bills for the fiscal year starting in April—even trickier. The bills include one that would cut the corporate tax rate by five percentage points and, critically, one to approve the issuance of bonds needed to finance 44% of the 92.4 trillion yen ($1.11 trillion) budget.
The DPJ does not control the upper house, and the main opposition parties have steadfastly ruled out supporting the government's budget-related proposal. The lower house can overrule a rejection but only through a two-thirds vote, a line the DPJ and its coalition partners fall short of by six votes. That gap widens to 22 if the 16 party rebels decide to oppose the legislation.


Mayor's Report Gives FDNY Poor Marks
From response times to civilian fatalities, nearly every statistical measure examining the New York City Fire Department during a four-month snapshot at the beginning of the current fiscal year shows its performance worsening, a report released by City Hall on Friday revealed.
The Preliminary Mayor's Management Report—a 200-plus page compendium of statistics chronicling city government's performance between July 1 and Oct. 31, 2010—painted an ostensibly bleak picture of the FDNY.
City officials questioned whether the report is a full and accurate representation of the FDNY's record. Mayor Michael Bloomberg continues to have full confidence in FDNY Commissioner Sal Cassano, said Marc LaVorgna, a mayoral spokesman.
"They brought fire deaths down to an all-time record low last year," Mr. LaVorgna said. "The mayor's confidence level in Sal Cassano and his team could not be higher."
According to the report:


U.S. Reaches Out to Libyan Opposition
The Obama administration is reaching out to Libyan opposition groups in a bid to accelerate the toppling of Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday.
Mrs. Clinton didn't specify which Libyan leaders Washington contacted, but said the U.S. was willing to provide relief to Libyans facing food and medical shortages.
Her comments came as two leading senators called on the Obama administration to give more aid to opposition forces in Libya, including weapons.
"Now is the time for action, not just statements," said Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, on CNN's "State of the Union." In addition to humanitarian assistance for the rebels, "I would provide them with arms," Mr. Lieberman said.
Mrs. Clinton spoke to reporters en route to an international conference in Geneva a day after President Barack Obama said in a statement that Mr. Gadhafi should step down.


Thousands Mourn Turkish Islamist Leader
ISTANBUL—Tens of thousands of Turks turned out Tuesday to mourn the death of Necmettin Erbakan, the country's first Islamist prime minister.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cut short a trip to Europe to attend the funeral, where a packed crowd outside Fatih Mosque chanted: "Mujahid [fighter for God] Erbakan," punching the air. Rows of mourners in side streets around the mosque and on the main boulevard knelt to pray.
In a mark of the central role Mr. Erbakan played as lifelong political leader of the country's religious conservatives, attendees at his burial service in Istanbul ranged from President Abdullah Gul to generals from the military that drove Mr. Erbakan from office in 1997.
Mr. Erbakan died of natural causes Sunday in an Ankara hospital. His body was brought to Istanbul after a smaller funeral service in the capital on Tuesday morning.
Mr. Erbakan became prime minister at the head of a coalition government in the 1990s but was driven from power after just a year. The Turkish military saw him as a threat to Turkey's secular nature and issued a number of public-policy demands and veiled threats that eventually prompted him to step aside.


Guilty Verdict in Killing of Motivational Speaker
A Manhattan jury found a man guilty of murder Thursday in the stabbing death of a Long Island motivational speaker, hours after the panel began its deliberations in the unusual case.
The jury found the suspect in the case, Kenneth Minor, guilty of having murdered Jeffrey Locker. The twist in the case was that Mr. Locker, who was heavily in debt prior to his death, apparently asked Mr. Minor to kill him and offered him money to do so. Attorneys for the defendant maintained the victim's death was an assisted suicide.
"This was murder for money, not a mercy killing, which is why we prosecuted the case as an intentional murder," said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. said in a statement, praising the verdict.
The defense acknowledged that Mr. Minor, 38, played a role in the death, but argued that he simply held the knife during the incident, and that Mr. Locker was responsible for lunging into it. The 52-year-old Mr. Locker was found dead in his SUV in East Harlem in July 2009. Mr. Minor was said to have received Mr. Locker's debit card and PIN number as compensation for his death.
Mr. Minor's team pointed to the testimony from a witness, Melvin Fleming, who said Mr. Locker had approached strangers in Harlem trying to find "someone to make him dead, to kill him." Mr. Fleming, an ex-convict and drug addict, testified that Mr. Locker had asked him to kill him. The defense also pointed to the dire financial straits Mr. Locker was in. By making his death look like a murder, the defense said, Mr. Locker's family could collect about $18 million worth of insurance policies.


GOP to Target Foreclosure-Prevention Programs
WASHINGTON—House Republicans next week will try to dismantle the Obama administration's efforts to stabilize the U.S. housing market, with votes planned in the House to terminate two programs aimed at helping troubled homeowners.
While next week's votes will be aimed at smaller programs, they are likely to be followed in the coming weeks by an attempt to shut down the administration's flagship foreclosure-prevention effort, the Home Affordable Modification Plan.
In total, Republicans plan to hold votes on bills ending four separate foreclosure programs.
Regardless of the House's likely votes to terminate the programs, the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up any of the bills. As a result, the votes expected over the coming weeks are largely political messaging moves by the GOP, especially because the party's conservative base has long opposed the Obama administration's foreclosure-prevention efforts.
Debating Programs' Costs, Necessity
Republicans argue that the programs are costly to taxpayers at a time when severe budgetary belt tightening is needed, have not succeeded in helping prevent many foreclosures and are prime examples of waste in the federal government.


Flix for Senator Dodd
Here's a list of movies that former U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd should watch now that he's getting more than $1.5 million a year to be the chief lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America:
"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never" (2011): "No lobbying, no lobbying," the Connecticut Democrat promised in August. Sounds like another song and dance, doesn't it?
"The Haunting in Connecticut" (2009): Not as scary as Mr. Dodd's five terms in the Senate.
"The Manchurian Candidate" (1962): Commies are inefficient. Capitalists know an easier way to brainwash politicians: money.
"Love and Other Drugs" (2010): At least Mr. Dodd's move isn't as nauseating as former Louisiana Republican congressman Billy Tauzin's. Mr. Tauzin gave us the socialized medicine known as Medicare Part D. Then he left Congress in 2005 for a $2.5-million-a-year gig running the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.


Syrian Political Prisoners Start Hunger Strike
DAMASCUS, Syria — Thirteen Syrian political prisoners have begun a hunger strike to demand their release and the lifting of emergency laws that give authorities a free hand to jail political and human rights activists, a rights group said Monday.
The prisoners include prominent human rights activist Haitham al-Maleh, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Mr. Al-Maleh, who is 80 years old and has diabetes and thyroid problems, has been under arrest since October 2009. He was jailed from 1980 until 1986 for demanding constitutional reforms.
The rights group said the activists launched the hunger strike in Damascus' Adra prison. The political detainees also include Ali Abdullah of the Damascus Declaration opposition group, prominent lawyer Anwar al-Bunni and Kurdish activist Mashaal Tammo.
The political detainees demanded an end to the emergency laws in force since the Baath Party came to power in 1963.
"Time has come to end this persecution matter as the winds of democratic change spread in the Arab world," the political detainees were quoted as saying in a statement from the rights group.


Terror Suspect Arrested in Scotland
LONDON—British police arrested a 30-year-old man in Glasgow, Scotland, in connection with a suicide bombing in Stockholm in December, marking the first arrest related to the high-profile terror attack.
Strathclyde police said the operation was the result of intelligence and "relates to allegations that this individual has been involved in aiding terrorist activities" outside of Scotland. People familiar with the matter confirmed that it was related to the Stockholm bombing.
Swedish authorities previously have said they are treating as a terrorist attack two explosions near Christmas shoppers on Stockholm streets on a Saturday afternoon in December. The blasts killed the suspected bomber, who police have said they believe to be Taimour Abdulwahab, and injured two others.


Egypt Push for Elections Draws Concern
CAIRO—After taking over from President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian military spent its first month in power trying to juggle competing political demands, quell labor unrest and defuse religious clashes—all while using minimal force.
Unprepared for the monumental task of governing the Arab world's largest country, Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces so far hasn't shown any sign it intends to cling to power permanently.
Instead, the Egyptian generals are pressing for an accelerated transfer to civilian rule, dismissing concerns that such a speedy transition would empower the previously outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and remnants of the old regime.
The military has already called a referendum on a slew of constitutional amendments for Sunday, and parliamentary elections in June. A presidential election two months later is set to usher in the country's first civilian president, with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa and former International Atomic Energy Agency director Mohamed ElBaradei seen as the two top contenders.
"The military has discovered that now they have to satisfy everybody, listen to everybody, deal with everybody. That's something that the military is not accustomed to," explains retired Maj. Gen. Mohamed Kadry Said, military adviser at the government-funded Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. In this transition, the military "focuses on time rather than quality," he says. "They feel that if the plan takes one or two years, it would become hell for them."


Libyan Rebels Flee Key Post, Retreat to Benghazi
AJDABIYA, Libya -- Rebels opposed to Col. Moammar Gadhafi's Tuesday fled this strategic post after government troops took the city in a stealth assault, overwhelming the only major population center on the way to the rebel capital Benghazi and making a crucial stride towards snuffing out the four-week-old uprising.
Demoralized rebel fighters streamed out of the city, trying to regroup along a four-lane highway to Benghazi that was packed with speeding ambulances and cars of fleeing Ajdabiya citizens.
"
Advance, unite in numbers. Yes, he owns planes, yes he owns missiles, but we have God with us and we'll achieve victory or death!" urged a frantic broadcast Tuesday afternoon on the Voice of Free Libya, the rebels' Benghazi-based channel. "This is our last stand."
Libyan government forces first pounded central Ajdabiya with air strikes, Grad rocket launchers, and Navy artillery Tuesday morning, multiple witnesses said. Then, Col. Gadhafi's troops disguised as civilians penetrated the city from the west and the southwest, quickly overruning Ajdabiya's center, said Ali Faraj Hammada, the head of Ajdabiya's revolutionary committee.


Obama Makes Pick to Fill Justice Post
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama Thursday nominated the first woman to lead the Justice Department's national-security prosecutions.
Lisa Monaco, 43 years old, was a prosecutor on the Justice Department team that investigated the collapse of energy company Enron.
If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Monaco would succeed David Kris as assistant attorney general for national security. The national-security division investigates and prosecutes counterterrorism, foreign espionage and other security cases.
Mr. Kris has left the division to become general counsel for Intellectual Ventures LLC, a Justice Department official said. The Bellevue, Wash., firm is led by former Microsoft Corp. executive Nathan Myhrvold and owns a large portfolio of technology patents.
Justice Department officials say the past two years have been the most active period for counterterrorism threats since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. In addition to a spate of domestic terror prosecutions, national-security prosecutors have investigated attempted attacks from al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.


Bahrain Arrests Opposition Leaders
MANAMA, Bahrain—Bahrain arrested several opposition leaders and activists in dawn raids Thursday, showing that the government aimed to widen its attempts at stifling the island's uprising.
The crackdown on the mostly Shiite opposition also points to a sharp turn in a political standoff within Bahrain's ruling family where hard-liners have appeared to gain the upper hand.
At the center of the dispute, analysts say, is Prime Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, 75 years old, who one of the country's most powerful and wealthy figures and the uncle of Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The unelected prime minister and a tight circle of conservative figures control Bahraini security forces and are believed to argue strongly against compromise and for the island's status quo.
On the other side stands the king's son, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, a younger man who has positioned himself as a voice of moderate reform. Until this week's crackdown, the crown prince had pushed for a dialog with the Shiite opposition, an approach that pitted himself against conservative Sunnis in his own family.
Thursday's events showed the extent of the ascendancy of the hard-line faction. Among those arrested were two leaders of the opposition Haq movement, including top leader Hassan Mushaima, a prominent Shiite activist; and Ebrahim Sharif, the leader of a moderate Sunni group called the National Democratic Party. A spokesman for Bahrain's government declined to comment on the arrests.


Preparing to Sacrifice
Shared sacrifice follows every disaster. It's only a matter of deciding who shares it.
"We're asking shared sacrifice from a lot of people," Michigan's Republican Gov. Rick Snyder said last week. "These are difficult times."
At least 3,000 protesters stormed Michigan's capitol to protest proposals to tax pensions and allow government managers facing financial emergencies to ditch union contracts.
Gov. Snyder had hoped to avoid the blowback that Gov. Scott Walker received in Wisconsin for stripping government workers of collective bargaining rights. But there it was.
State by state, the GOP and organized labor have been challenging each other's rights to exist like Hamas and Israel. Unions have long thrown most of their support to Democrats. And Republicans have never seen a better time to strike back.


Raids Illustrate Obama Doctrine
From the start of White House deliberations about how to respond to the crisis in Libya, President Barack Obama set two clear parameters for his top advisers: he didn't want to use military force if the U.S. had to be in the lead and he had no intention of sending American ground troops.
With Saturday's start of airstrikes against Libyan leader Col. Moammar Ghadafi, Mr. Obama appears to be putting into practice a foreign-policy doctrine he first sketched during the 2008 presidential campaign.
Facing off against then-fellow Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in a debate for the Democratic primary, Mr. Obama said he didn't want to just end the war in Iraq. "I want to end the mind-set that got us into war in the first place," he said.
In contrast to his predecessor, President George W. Bush, who invaded Iraq in 2003 despite opposition from many allies and Democrats, Mr. Obama is taking pains to receive unambiguous legal authority through the United Nations, getting clear support from Arab states and then letting others—France and Britain —lead the military charge.
The approach risks opening Mr. Obama to criticism from the right, in particular, but also from the brand of liberal internationalism that animates some of his advisers. Potential Republican presidential candidates for 2012 have criticized the president in recent days for appearing tentative and not pushing America's traditional role of international peacekeeper.


All-Terrain Victories
We told you last week about Boeing's big tort victory, and this week Yamaha won another court verdict in defense of its all-terrain vehicles. Maybe resistance to the plaintiffs bar isn't futile.
In 2003 Yamaha introduced a new category of ATV known as Rhino to the U.S. market. Unlike single-passenger ATVs, the Rhino "side by side" allows for two passengers to sit next to each other. The Rhino became an instant hit with farmers, hunters and ATV enthusiasts, and rivals rushed to offer their own versions.
In 2007, Yamaha made several minor modifications—including half-doors and more passenger hand-holds—to increase the Rhino's safety. The plaintiffs bar pounced, citing the modifications as evidence that the product hadn't been safe. Spearheaded by California firm Lieff Cabraser, hundreds of lawsuits rolled in, many generated via the Internet. The lawyers also deluged the Consumer Product Safety Commission with complaints, hoping the federal agency would aid their suits by ordering a Rhino recall.
Yamaha avoided that by working with the agency to make other modest safety changes. As for the lawsuits, it did something unusual: It chose to fight. This no doubt surprised the plaintiffs bar, whose strategy is to swamp a company with so many lawsuits that it agrees to settle.
Yet Yamaha had a strong case. Like any ATV, the Rhino comes with guidelines for proper use. Riders are told to wear helmets, seatbelts and safety gear, and not to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It is recommended only for licensed drivers, only for two people, and for off-road use.


NATO to Take Total Libya Control
BRUSSELS—The top military committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved plans Sunday for the takeover of all international military operations in and around Libya, diplomats said.
The technical decision, which approves operational plans put together by military planners over the previous two days, opens the way for a political decision by NATO's key decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council. That could come as soon as Sunday evening at a scheduled meeting of the NAC, which comprises the ambassadors to NATO of the 28 member nations.
The alliance's phased takeover of the no-fly zone is already underway, after agreement late Thursday for NATO to take responsibility for that part of the operation. NATO is also enforcing an arms embargo on the country.


Hatian Reprieve
Haiti's electoral council announced this week that Michel "Sweet Micky" Martelly won the presidential runoff last month with some 67% of the ballots. He'll take office on May 14. Despite Mr. Martelly's lack of political experience, his election is good news if only because he is an outsider to the country's corrupt political system. That said, it's no news that obstacles to success are everywhere. As the U.S. moves to support the new president, it should avoid its many Haitian mistakes of recent years.
The 50-year-old musician, who lived in Florida for a time, has never held public office. But he has showed executive skills by building a successful entertainment business and by running a nonprofit that ships and distributes goods and medical supplies to Haiti during periods of crisis.
His past as a risque stage performer put off some conservative Haitians. But as a candidate willing to challenge the political elite, he caught the imagination of young, urbanized Haitians who can read and write and desperately want to live in a better country. "Things are going to change," he said confidently this week in his first press conference as president-elect.
High energy, well-directed political will and international support will all be needed if the new president is to have a chance of moving Haiti forward. But these are insufficient.
Mr. Martelly inherits a kleptocratic, inefficient bureaucracy. Even if he can assemble an able cabinet within Haiti's parliamentary system, little competence exists to support its good intentions.


Belarus Detains Three in Bomb Blast
Authorities in Belarus hinted Tuesday that unnamed opponents of the country's authoritarian government could have been behind a subway bombing in Minsk Monday that killed 12 and injured dozens more—in a sign they may clamp down further on dissent.
Belarus's security services said they had detained three unidentified people in connection with the rush-hour blast, but were still hunting for their chief suspect.
The government in the former Soviet republic said the blast was an attempt to destabilize the country, which was the scene of protests after a disputed presidential election in December. Police stepped up security measures in Minsk, using metal detectors to check subway passengers.
In comments reported by the state news agency, Vadim Zaitsev, the head of Belarus's KGB, which still goes by its Soviet-era name, said the explosion may have been a "revenge" attack for a crackdown on dissidents that followed the December demonstrations.
Police beat and arrested hundreds of marchers who took to the streets after polls closed on Dec. 19, and also jailed opposition candidates who had run against the country's long-serving authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko.


U.S. Warns Two Mines on Safety
Federal mine safety officials placed two coal mines in Kentucky and West Virginia on notice that they could be shut down for any future safety violations, using for the first time an enforcement tool that has been on the books for more than 30 years.
The Mine Safety and Health Administration said Bledsoe Coal Corp.'s Abner Branch Rider Mine in Leslie County, Ky., and New West Virginia Mining Co.'s Apache Mine in McDowell County, W.Va., failed to correct safety problems after being targeted for stricter oversight late last year. Representatives of New West Virginia Mining and James River Coal Co. , of Richmond, Va., which owns the Bledsoe operation, couldn't immediately be reached to comment.
"We're trying to send a message to the mining industry that you do not want to go down this path," said Joseph A. Main, head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. "We're hopeful that we'll make mines safer."
Instead of lowering the rate of violations over the past few months, Mr. Main said the two mines actually had a higher rate of violations for problems like accumulations of explosive coal dust. "The great disappointment is that they didn't take measures to fix their problems to avoid this enforcement action," said Mr. Main. He said management at the Apache mine has temporarily closed the mine but could potentially reopen it.
The federal safety agency will shut production at the mines and order miners to leave every time an inspector cites the mine for a serious safety violation. The mine would remain closed until the operator corrects the problem.


Detroit Schools Ex-Official Guilty
DETROIT—The former chief risk manager for Detroit's school district pleaded guilty Monday to extortion and conspiracy charges for receiving kickbacks from a hand-picked vendor running an employee wellness program.
Stephen A. Hill, the former executive director of the risk management department of the Detroit Public Schools, selected the vendor in 2005 without competitive bidding and without a written contract, according to federal prosecutors. The vendor, Associates for Learning, proposed a six-month pilot program for a total of $150,000.
Within a year, court documents show, the vendor's invoices to the district ballooned to more than $3.32 million. Mr. Hill approved the invoices and, in return, received a 5% cash kickback, according to prosecutors. A Detroit phone number listed for Associates for Learning was disconnected when reached Monday.
Under the terms of the plea agreement, Mr. Hill, 59 years old, faces up to nine years in prison. He could be ordered to pay $3.32 million in restitution, funds needed by a district struggling to close a $327 million deficit. Brian Legghio, Mr. Hill's attorney, said that if Mr. Hill cooperates with federal prosecutors in their remaining case, as he intends to do, the U.S. attorney's office would recommend a prison sentence of 54 months.
Mr. Hill's guilty plea marks the seventh conviction in the case, one of several episodes of corruption that have been investigated during the tenure of the district's emergency financial manager, Robert Bobb, who took charge more than two years ago. Nine people were charged as part of the vendor kickback investigations. The final defendant is set for a jury trial in June.


PwC in $25.5 Million Settlement
Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has agreed to pay $25.5 million to settle investor class-action allegations that its audits failed to stop a large accounting fraud at India's Satyam Computer Services Ltd.
The settlement resolves class-action litigation against PwC over the 2009 scandal in which B. Ramalinga Raju, Satyam's founder and chairman, admitted Satyam's cash balances had been overstated by $1 billion over five years.
The settlement, reached with a mediator's help, was disclosed in documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and is subject to court approval. It follows PwC's agreement last month to pay $7.5 million to settle U.S. regulators' charges that PwC's audits of Satyam were inadequate.
PwC confirmed it had agreed to the class-action settlement but wouldn't comment further about it. The settlement covers the umbrella firm for PwC's global network, along with its U.S. partnership and Indian affiliates.
Satyam itself agreed in February to settle with the class-action investors for $125 million and agreed in April to pay $10 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges.


Divisions Shown in Nuclear Commission
A congressional hearing Wednesday revealed sharp divisions within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it re-examines the safety of the U.S. nuclear-power industry in the wake of the events that crippled a nuclear-power plant in Japan.
Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko in recent days has publicly questioned if U.S. reactors needed to install more emergency power, a potentially expensive step. Mr. Jaczko has also suggested that the commission should examine the industry's flood preparedness and methods for storing spent fuel, both issues connected to the problems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Jaczko's leadership came under attack at a House hearing where Republican lawmakers accused him of improperly delaying a decision on the fate of a proposed nuclear-waste repository in Nevada's Yucca Mountain. Some of the chairman's fellow commissioners also acknowledged they have disagreed with Mr. Jaczko over certain aspects of his handling of the proposed repository.
"The chairman..appears to me to be playing some sort of foot-dragging game" on Yucca Mountain, said Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas).
Mr. Jaczko defended his actions as lawful and said it would be a "tremendous waste of money" for the NRC to devote extensive resources to reviewing the project, given that the Obama administration has called for killing it and has already closed the Department of Energy office that had been in charge of managing it.


New Delhi's New Gag
India's loud democracy is always keen to express itself, the latest medium being the Web. So Indians were alarmed when the government last month released rules to police the Internet. The rules increase the state's monitoring and make it very easy to block content. And, on closer inspection, they continue the uneasy legal relationship the world's largest democracy has with free speech.
The ostensible rationale for the new rules is national security. Radical Islamist groups have been known to use the Internet to recruit and communicate within India, while the terrorists who laid siege to Mumbai in November 2008 deftly used technology. So a government like India's, accountable to an electorate and checked and balanced by other institutions, is within its rights to step up scrutiny of cyberspace.
Even so, these rules raise eyebrows because they are vague and sometimes unrelated to national security. One rule won't allow users to post information that is "blasphemous," "obscene" or "pornographic." Lashkar-e-Taiba poses many threats to India, but being pornographic isn't one of them. Another rule forces an Internet service provider to censor information within 36 hours if any person writes in to complain.
Such provisions suggest that national security is just an umbrella under which the government is trying to address other social concerns. Though they haven't always been this paranoid over the free flow of information, Indian governments have historically feared sparks that bring fringe groups to violence. India's 1950 constitution enshrines speech as a fundamental right, but allows "reasonable restrictions," such as for "morality." The country's penal code decrees an "outrage" against "religious feelings" unlawful.
But governments have used these caveats as a way to appease mobs. Hindu nationalist groups have vandalized the paintings of M.F. Husain, who has depicted Hindu deities in the nude since the 1990s; yet instead of curbing the vandalism, officials charged Mr. Husain in 2006 for hurting sentiments. Muslims groups have violently protested against Bangladeshi authoress Taslima Nasreen, who is critical of Islam—the local government's response last year was to arrest those who compiled and distributed a book where Ms. Nasreen had expressed her views.


EU to Sanction 13 Syrian Officials
BRUSSELS—European Union ambassadors agreed Friday that the bloc should extend sanctions against 13 Syrian officials, not including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, EU officials said.
The decision to extend sanctions will be put to EU foreign ministers early next week and could be in place by the end of the week, EU officials said.
The extra sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes for 13 senior officials from the government, military and intelligence services "involved in the repression" one official said, but won't apply to Mr. Assad. Some EU members, including France, had expressed their support for including him in the measures.
The sanctions come in addition to a range of reactions already in place, including an arms embargo and an end to trade agreements. The EU had earmarked €129 million in aid to Syria for 2011-13 for various programs to help economic and rural developments, while the European Investment Bank has €1.3 billion in programs for Syria.
The sanctions package is being imposed more swiftly, going to EU foreign ministers via a written procedure. Foreign ministers would usually have to sign off on such a plan in person; their next scheduled meeting is in Brussels on May 23.


Pakistan-U.S. Rift Widens
Pakistani media aired the name of a man they said is the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief, prompting questions about whether the Pakistani government tried to out a CIA operative in the wake of the killing of Osama bin Laden.
The U.S. is looking into the matter. There are no plans at this time to withdraw the station chief. If the government had attempted to publicize the name, that would be the second such outing in the past six months, a sign of how deeply U.S.-Pakistan relations have soured.
The CIA declined to comment. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tensions, which have been building between the two countries for months, exploded after the bin Laden strike, which sharply embarrassed the Pakistani government. In another source of strain, the U.S. is pressing the Pakistanis for access to bin Laden's three wives, who are being held in Pakistani custody. The Pakistani government isn't complying with the request, a U.S. official said.
The Islamabad station chief is one of the CIA's most critical and sensitive assignments. The position oversees the agency's covert programs, including the drone campaign that targets al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, as well as fighters who cross the border into Afghanistan.


Germany to Sanction Iranian Bank
BERLIN — Germany has signed on to a European Union plan to sanction an Iranian-controlled German bank that handles billions of euros in annual transactions for clients doing business in the Islamic republic, people familiar with the matter say.
"The track is set for sanctioning of the European-Iranian Trade Bank AG," a German official who is familiar with the decision said.
The E.U. is expected to formally announce the decision to sanction EIH, as the bank is known under its German acronym, on May 23rd, when E.U. foreign ministers review proposals for new sanctions against Iran, the person said.
In a statement, EIH says that its activities are legal and that it continues to operate under a German license.
The decision marks an about-face in Germany's policy. In February, Germany blocked a French proposal in Brussels to designate EIH for EU sanctions, two diplomats familiar with the discussion said. German business representatives have lobbied at Germany's Economics ministry in support of EIH, arguing the bank enables transactions that are essential for legal exports to Iran.


China Accuses Ai of Tax Evasion
BEIJING—China accused the artist-activist Ai Weiwei of evading "a huge amount" of tax through a company he controlled, in the most detailed explanation yet of the charges against the prominent government critic who was detained six weeks ago.
Police investigators also found that Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd.—the company that handles Mr. Ai's financial affairs—had intentionally destroyed accounting documents, according to a report published by the state-run Xinhua news agency late Friday.
Mr. Ai's relatives didn't respond to telephone calls, but they have previously dismissed similar accusations, and his wife, Lu Qing, says the company in question is registered and belongs to her, according to the Associated Press.
The Xinhua report gave no further details of the charges against Mr. Ai, who was detained at Beijing's airport on April 3 shortly before he was due to board a flight to Hong Kong and wasn't allowed to communicate with his family until this past Sunday, when he met his wife.
But Xinhua added that Mr. Ai's right to meet with "people who live with him" was guaranteed under Chinese law while he was under "residential surveillance"—a form of house arrest that is often used in politically sensitive cases in China.


Obama Backs Bipartisan Resolution on Libya
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama on Friday invited Congress to approve U.S. intervention in Libya, expressing "support" for a bipartisan resolution drawn up by a group of senators authorizing the military operation.
Under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, passed amid the turbulence of the Vietnam War, presidents must obtain congressional approval for the use of force within 60 days, or else begin withdrawing. That deadline was Friday for the Libya operation.
Many presidents, as well as lawmakers and scholars, have questioned the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, and Mr. Obama pointedly did not mention it in his letter.
The 60-day mark nonetheless provided a focal point for congressional critics of the Libya operation, and Mr. Obama appeared to be seeking formal approval by Congress while sidestepping any comment on the War Powers Resolution itself.
"Congressional action in support of the mission would underline the U.S. commitment to this remarkable international effort," Mr. Obama wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. "It has always been my view that it is better to take military action, even in limited actions such as this, with congressional engagement, consultation and support."


Balancing Act
House Republicans are starting to rally behind a strategy on the debt ceiling called "cut, cap and balance." This is the condition for an agreement to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling that was recently laid out by House Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy of California.
"What this means is we want an iron clad cut in spending over the next five years; an enforceable cap on outlays with automatic sequestration if the caps aren't met; and a balanced-budget requirement," said Mr. McCarthy.
The strategy is also being pushed by conservatives on the House Republican Study Committee. According to sources there, RSC Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio will unveil a plan in the days to come that will require a balanced-budget agreement plus a cap on spending that brings federal outlays down to "around 18% of GDP after 10 years." Several RSC members are still smarting over the fact that the spending cuts in the 2010 continuing resolution were much smaller than promised, and this has only emboldened conservatives to take a harder line on the debt ceiling.
That could be bad news for the White House and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who continues to talk about "Armageddon" if the debt bill is not passed. The scare tactic doesn't appear to be working. This week Mr. Geithner sent a letter to congressional leaders once again urging "timely action to increase the debt limit in order to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and avoid catastrophic economic consequences for citizens." Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri echoed the sentiment of a large majority of his House Republican colleagues when he responded, "We just can't fold like we did on the CR, because the real financial crisis happens if we don't solve this debt problem."
In the Senate, meanwhile, debt ceiling talks have been stalled by Democratic demands for tax increases. Republicans want Democrats to take tax rate increases "off the table," as Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) put it. Sen. Kyl said that even tax loophole closers shouldn't be part of the debt ceiling talks but should be done "in the context of reforming our Tax Code so we can use those increased revenues in order to reduce the tax rates so that our country can be more competitive."


David Gratzer: Vermont Gives the 'Public Option' a Clinical Trial
In America's courtrooms, ObamaCare is on trial. A majority of states have filed lawsuits arguing that its mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance is unconstitutional. But in Vermont, ObamaCare is about to get a trial of a different sort—a clinical one.
This coming Thursday, Gov. Peter Shumlin will sign a bill doing what President Obama and his allies have hoped to do all along: sell a public insurance option alongside competing private insurance as a first step toward a single-payer, government-run system. Unlike the president, Mr. Shumlin has been up-front in his support for single-payer care, even on the campaign trail last fall. At least he can say he has a mandate from voters to do what he's doing.
The last time Vermont's health system gained national attention was in 2004, when Howard Dean, then governor of the state, ran for president. As governor, Mr. Dean expanded public insurance eligibility, struggling to get as close to single-payer health care as he legally could. New regulations pushed out private insurers, reducing competition. Vermont imposed a guaranteed-issue mandate, which requires insurers to sell to any applicant, and forced insurers to use community rating, which requires them to offer the same price to everyone, regardless of age and health. Both measures also appeared in the final ObamaCare law.
The result? The number of uninsured Vermonters barely budged. But costs sure moved—in the wrong direction. From 1991 to 2004, according to the Kaiser Foundation, Vermont's health costs grew by 7.6% annually. Across the U.S. comparable costs grew only 5.5% on average. From 2005 to 2008, in data cited by Dr. William Hsaio, a Harvard consultant studying this for the state, growth in Vermont's health costs grew 8.2%, against a national average of 5.7%.
The current governor says his plan is "all about containing costs," echoing Mr. Obama's absurd claim that increased health spending would mean lower deficits. Mr. Shumlin can talk about government health care and savings in the same breath because millions of Americans still believe the myth that socialized health-care models are immune from cost inflation.


Explosion in Kabul Kills at Least Six
KABUL, Afghanistan—A Taliban suicide bomber hit Kabul's largest military hospital Saturday with a powerful blast that killed at least six people and once again showed insurgents' ability to penetrate some of Afghanistan's most closely guarded government installations.
Afghan officials said the bomber targeted scores of Afghan military medical trainers and young students eating lunch in a tent outside the 400-bed hospital, located just about a half mile from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. More than 34 people were wounded.
The attack in one of Kabul's most secure neighborhoods was the latest to target the Afghan capital, which has suffered from several Taliban bombings and shootings this year, after a months-long lull in violence. Over the last two months, at least 17 people, including eight U.S. service members, have been killed in Kabul.
The targeting of Kabul has battered the capital's recent image as a relative oasis of calm in the country, something that U.S. officials had hailed as a symbol of success in the fight against the Taliban. The two previous major attacks—at the ministry of defense and at the Kabul military airport—also took place inside supposedly well protected military grounds.
By stepping up attacks on Afghan security forces, the Taliban aim to disrupt the planned transition of security responsibilities to the Afghan troops, scheduled to start this summer, ahead of the planned pullout of most foreign forces by late 2014.


In Japan, Looking for Lost Livelihoods
RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan—Until March 11, Yayoi Kumagai supported her family by working on the assembly line in a seafood-processing plant here. But the tsunami that struck that day destroyed the factory and upended her financial security.
A 43-year-old single mother with two teenage sons, Ms. Kumagai is among the growing ranks of people struggling to find jobs more than two months after the disaster that killed 20,000 people, wrecked communities up and down Japan's northeast coast, and left the region's economy in tatters.
Many of those people are now facing up to the reality that their old skills may never be useful again, while some others are already moving away.
"Fisheries was the biggest industry around here and most of that was wiped out," says Tadaaki Kon, director of the Japanese government's Public Employment Security Office in neighboring Ofunato, which has seen a surge in applications for unemployment benefits since the tsunami.
Unless Rikuzentakata and other hard-hit communities can create jobs, residents will be forced to look for employment in other parts of Japan, potentially splitting up families already struggling to cope with the stress of the disaster.


Rebels Offer Amnesty to Pro-Gadhafi Soldiers
BENGHAZI, Libya – The political leader of Libya's rebels offered amnesty on Saturday to those ready to abandon Col. Moammar Gadhafi and rejected all peace initiatives that were not predicated on the departure of the Libyan strongman, his family and senior regime figures.
"Those still betting on Moammar Gadhafi's regime should wake up to reality and abandon it and join the righteous and just cause," said Mustafa Abdel-Jalil head of the rebels' National Transitional Council reading from a prepared statement during a press conference.
Mr. Abdel-Jalil, a former judge and justice minister in Col. Gadhafi's regime who joined the rebel movement in its early days, explained that defectors guilty of crimes before the start of the uprising on Feb. 17 would be guaranteed "a fair trial."
He said those who committed crimes after this date would be forgiven if they left the regime now.
A senior Western diplomat stationed in Benghazi said on Friday that such an amnesty was crucial to encourage pro-Gadhafi troops and officers to stop fighting thereby hastening the regime's collapse.


Taliban Bombers Strike Herat
KABUL—Taliban insurgents broadened their spring offensive to the relatively tranquil city of Herat on Monday, staging a coordinated attack that killed four Afghans and injured at least four coalition soldiers at a major base in western Afghanistan, according to Afghan officials.
The attackers triggered a powerful car bomb in front of the Italian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team compound in Herat and then tried to storm the compound, according Afghan and North Atlantic Treaty Organization military officials.
At around the same time, insurgents detonated a second blast in a more heavily populated part of the city.
The assault was the first major attack in Herat since October, when Taliban insurgents tried to ram a car bomb into the city's United Nations office and dispatch suicide bombers disguised as burqa-wearing women into the compound.
While Herat has remained largely insulated from the worst of the country's violence, the province has seen a spike in attacks this year.


Off the California Rails
Even Left Coasters are beginning to grumble about the Obama Administration's ideological imperative for high-speed rail that defies all common sense.
A couple of weeks ago California's Legislative Analyst's Office issued a withering report calling the state's 500-mile high-speed rail project between Anaheim and San Francisco a fiscal crackup ready to happen. (See "California's Next Train Wreck," May 18.)
The federal Department of Transportation has offered $3 billion of stimulus funds with the catch that the state has to begin construction by 2012 and build the first segment in the Central Valley. A stand-alone segment running through a sparsely populated area couldn't operate without a huge taxpayer subsidy, but a voter-approved ballot measure explicitly prohibits any such subsidies.
At the urging of the state watchdog, the rail authority asked the feds for more flexibility about where and when to start building. Last week the Department of Transportation told them to dream on. In a letter responding to the request for more flexibility, Under Secretary for Policy Roy Kienitz ordered the authority to charge full speed ahead since "once major construction is underway and approvals to complete other sections of the line have been obtained, the private sector will have compelling reasons to invest in further construction." Private sector seems to be the Obama Administration's code for government.


Egyptian Man Held in Alleged Assault on Hotel Maid
A businessman from Alexandria, Egypt, was arrested Monday at Manhattan's posh Pierre hotel on charges that he sexually abused a maid, police said.
Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar, 74 years old, was being held in police custody after being charged with sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching and harassment, police said.
The alleged attack took place on Sunday at about 6 p.m., when the maid delivered a box of tissues that had been requested by the guest at the Upper East Side hotel. Mr. Omar allegedly locked the 44-year-old maid in the room and forcibly touched and fondled her, police said. It wasn't clear why the incident wasn't immediately reported to police.
It wasn't immediately known if Mr. Omar had retained an attorney. The Pierre said in a statement that the incident had been reported to the police, who were investigating, and that the hotel would comply.


McCain Visits Myanmar to Assess Reforms
U.S. Sen. John McCain traveled to Myanmar on Wednesday as American officials intensify their efforts to determine whether the country's new military-backed government is serious about pursuing economic and political reforms.
The new government took power in March after the military—which has controlled the resource-rich country since 1962—held its first elections in two decades late last year. Western observers decried the vote as a sham designed to put a democratic gloss on the military regime, with military-backed candidates and soldiers winning every top post, amid widespread reports of voting irregularities.
Myanmar officials and some Asian neighbors said the vote was a major step forward, and have called on the U.S. and other Western nations to start easing economic sanctions that have blocked Western investment for years.
U.S. officials have said that they don't believe the elections represented significant progress, and that they have no intention of easing sanctions unless more meaningful changes occur, including the release of 2,000 or more political prisoners. Myanmar's military has also been accused of widespread human-rights abuses.
U.S. officials have continued discussions with Myanmar officials in recent months and have launched fact-finding missions to the country to see if there is any sign more meaningful reforms could follow last year's vote. Last month, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Joseph Y. Yun visited, urging authorities to take "meaningful, concrete steps toward democratic governance," and calling for the release of political prisoners.


Japan Party Leaders Discuss Kan's Exit
TOKYO—With Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan likely to step down this summer, the country's ruling and opposition party leaders are now clashing over how soon Mr. Kan should leave office.
Both Katsuya Okada, the secretary general of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, and Nobuteru Ishihara, the secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, appeared on two television programs Sunday morning to discuss Mr. Kan's departure and how the parties could work together in tackling the major challenges facing Japan since the March 11 earthquake and the ongoing nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant.
"The timing of (Mr. Kan's) departure is his own decision," said Mr. Okada. Debating over whether he should leave in June or August won't benefit Japan when the parliament discussions should be focusing on the second supplementary budget for the current fiscal year and legislation to issue government bonds to cover deficits, he said.
Mr. Kan on Thursday survived a no-confidence vote after making a surprise, if vague, announcement that he would resign once the bulk of earthquake recovery work was done. Since then, the focus of the political debate has shifted to the exact timing of his departure.
On Saturday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano implied that Mr. Kan may step down before September, and Japanese media, quoting other government officials, reported that a departure some time this summer is becoming more likely. The Nikkei reported Sunday morning that Mr. Kan has told a DPJ executive that he intends to stay in office at least until the second supplementary budget and the deficit-covering government bond issuance bills pass.


Off-Duty NYC Correction Officer Shoots Attacker
An off-duty correction officer has shot and wounded a man who attacked him with a pipe outside a fast food restaurant in Brooklyn.
It happened at 12:40 p.m. Saturday outside a McDonald's on Church Avenue in East Flatbush.
Police say it began when a 67-year-old customer was attacked by the man. Correction officer Michael Turnbull intervened, but the man swung at him with a pipe and Turnbull drew his weapon and shot him in the leg.
Police say Mr. Turnbull shot him again in the leg when the attacker continued to swing at him.
The man was hospitalized in serious condition. His identity was not immediately released.


Democrats for Pension Reform
Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and the state's top two Democratic leaders struck a deal on Wednesday to modify public employee retirement and health benefits, which would save the state at least $122 billion over the next 30 years. Unions like to portray such reforms as GOP assaults on labor, but Garden State Democrats are demonstrating that saving taxpayer money isn't always partisan.
Thanks to union giveaways by governors of both parties, New Jersey's pension system is running a $54 billion unfunded liability. Joshua Rauh, a finance professor at Northwestern University's business school, last year forecast that the system would go broke in 2018 without reform.
While the compromise with Democrats scales back Mr. Christie's original proposal, it's still a large step in the right direction. The deal would raise the retirement age for new workers to 65 from 62, and increase pension contributions to 7.5% from 5.5% for state workers and to 10% from 8.5% for public safety officers. The legislation would also suspend annual cost of living adjustments until the fund reaches a more healthy status. This provision alone could reduce retirees' pension value by 30% over the next decade.
Once the plan is 80% funded, new employee-employer pension governing boards would be authorized to modify contribution rates and pension formulas based on the recommendation of actuaries. This would theoretically take pensions off the bargaining table, and these boards could hardly do any worse by taxpayers than the current unholy alliance of lawmakers and the public unions that finance their re-election. We prefer switching workers to defined contribution plans in which employees rather than taxpayers bear the risk of their retirement investments, but Mr. Christie didn't propose that reform, even for new workers.


Obama to Personally Tweet
MINNEAPOLIS -- President Barack Obama is taking a more active role on Twitter, 140 characters at a time.
Obama's campaign said in a posting on its website Friday that Obama will tweet regularly from the popular social media service and his personal tweets will be signed "-BO." The campaign said it will now manage both Obama's Twitter account and Facebook page.
Obama tweeted personally early Friday evening, welcoming followers to "a new @BarackObama. From now on, #Obama2012 staff will manage this account; tweets from the President will be signed "-BO."
The campaign said on its website that the changes "will give us new opportunities to make the most of these channels, using them not only to report what the president is doing every day but to connect to the millions of supporters who will be driving this campaign."
Obama has more than 8.69 million followers on Twitter, making him the third most-followed account among Twitter users, according to Twitter statistics website twittercounter.com. Obama trails only entertainers Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber in followers.


Pakistan Arrests General
ISLAMABAD—Pakistan's military said Tuesday it has arrested a brigadier general for his alleged radical Islamic connections as the nation's powerful armed forces face the growing threat of an Islamist backlash within their ranks.
Brig. Gen. Ali Khan, who served at army headquarters in Rawalpindi near Islamabad, was detained in the aftermath of the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in early May, an army spokesman said. He is the highest-ranking officer to be arrested for alleged connections to Islamic militants who are suspected of trying to infiltrate Pakistan's military.
An army spokesman said Brig. Gen. Khan was posted at headquarters two years ago and was believed to be associated with Hizb ut-Tahrir, an outlawed radical Islamic group. The group, which has roots in the Middle East and has also been active in Britain, clandestinely dropped pamphlets in military cantonments after the bin Laden raid calling on soldiers to rise against the military leadership. It accused Pakistan's military leaders of being complicit in the U.S. operation. It also called for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.
"The military has zero tolerance for any such activity and strict disciplinary action will be taken against those involved," said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the chief military spokesman. It isn't clear how many more arrests were made in connection with the pamphlet probe. Brig. Gen. Khan isn't believed to have played a role in any sheltering bin Laden received in the garrison town of Abbottabad, where he was killed last month.
Brig. Gen. Khan, 59 years old, is said to have a brilliant service record and comes from a family with three generations of military service. His father was a junior commissioned officer and one of his brothers is a colonel serving in military intelligence. One of his sons and a son-in-law also are army officers.


After Delay, Sudan Leader Arrives in Beijing
BEIJING—Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir arrived for a visit to influential ally China on Tuesday, after a daylong delay that threw a wrench into a trip that had already brought Beijing under fire for offering to host him.
Mr. Bashir was due to arrive in Beijing early Monday for talks with Chinese officials, including Chinese President Hu Jintao. But for reasons that remain unclear, his plane was diverted as it was flying over Turkmenistan on Monday and forced to return to Tehran.
Mr. Bashir's visit to China marks a rare overseas trip by the African leader, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. The trip's aim is to shore up ties with China, Sudan's biggest oil-export market, just weeks ahead of July 9, when oil-rich Sudan is set to split into two countries following decades of deadly wars.
Mr. Bashir's northern government and leaders in the south have been unable to reach an agreement on how to share oil revenues. Battles have flared in the past month in an important oil-producing zone and other areas along the north-south border.
On Monday in New York, the U.N. Security Council voted to establish a 4,200-man peacekeeping force for the disputed Abyei province, scene of much of the recent fighting.


French Journalists Held by Taliban Return Home
KABUL–Two television journalists held in captivity in Afghanistan for nearly 18 months arrived in France Thursday to an emotional welcome. Both journalists were kidnapped in December 2009 while reporting east of Kabul.
Television reporter Hervé Ghesquière, 47, tears of joy in his eyes, described being confined indoors "23 and three-quarters hours a day" and repeatedly having his hopes raised of an imminent release — then dashed, the Associated Press reported.
"When you crawl out of a hole and there's nothing for 18 months .. Whoo!" said Ghesquière, searching for words, the AP reported.
Cameraman Stéphane Taponier, 46, at his side, broke into a grin as he told the AP, "We're doing really, really, really well."
The Taliban said in a statement that they had released the journalists in exchange for two of the insurgency's commanders. This week the group executed a late-night siege of a hotel in Kabul which left at least 21 people dead, raising concerns that the security picture may be worsening despite U.S. claims that the situation has improved in Afghanistan.


Iran Sends Arms to Iraq, Afghanistan
TEHRAN—Iran's elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has transferred lethal new munitions to its allies in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent months, according to senior U.S. officials, in a bid to accelerate the U.S. withdrawals from these countries.
The Revolutionary Guard has smuggled rocket-assisted exploding projectiles to its militia allies in Iraq, weapons that have already resulted in the deaths of American troops, defense officials said. They said Iranians have also given long-range rockets to the Taliban in Afghanistan, increasing the insurgents' ability to hit U.S. and other coalition positions from a safer distance.
Such arms shipments would escalate the shadow competition for influence playing out between Tehran and Washington across the Middle East and North Africa, fueled by U.S. preparations to draw down forces from two wars and the political rebellions that are sweeping the region.
The U.S. is wrestling with the aftermath of uprisings against longtime Arab allies from Tunisia to Bahrain, and trying to leave behind stable, friendly governments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Iran appears to be trying to gain political ground amid the turmoil and to make the U.S. withdrawals as quick and painful as possible.
"I think we are likely to see these Iranian-backed groups continue to maintain high attack levels" as the exit date nears, Maj. Gen. James Buchanan, the U.S. military's top spokesman in Iraq, said in an interview. "But they are not going to deter us from doing everything we can to help the Iraqi security forces."


NATO: 4 Troops Killed in Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan—NATO says four of its service members have been killed in two separate attacks in eastern Afghanistan.
The international coalition says three NATO troops died from an improvised roadside bomb and a fourth soldier was killed in a separate insurgent attack.
No other details about Tuesday's deaths were released.
The deaths bring to 280 the number of international troops killed so far this year and nine this month.

Alleged Mob Boss Bulger Pleads Not Guilty
BOSTON—Alleged mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 19 murder charges in a case that has riveted New England since he was caught in Southern California last month after eluding authorities for 16 years.
Appearing in orange prison garb and shackles in a federal courthouse just blocks from the South Boston neighborhood he allegedly once ruled as chief of the infamous Winter Hill Gang, the 81-year-old Mr. Bulger spoke softly as he repeatedly answered "not guilty" to multiple racketeering charges that include allegations of extortion, drug distribution, illegal weapons, money laundering, and 19 murders between 1973 and 1985.
Mr. Bulger was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's "Ten Most Wanted" list until he was captured two weeks ago, living in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, Calif., with pistols and more than $800,000 stashed away. His longtime companion, Catherine Greig, faces federal harboring charges and is due in court next week.
Government prosecutors said they anticipate calling between 30 and 40 witnesses in what they expect will be a four-week trial. His next scheduled court appearance is in September.
Mr. Bulger is being represented by a public defender, high-profile Boston criminal-defense lawyer J.W. Carney Jr., who said it can take as long as two or three years for a major criminal trial to come to court.


Newspapers: Oslo Must Not Restrict Freedoms
As the disbelief at the sheer scale of Friday's attacks in and around Oslo began to register in Norway, the country's leading newspapers on Saturday urged the Scandinavian nation to maintain its free and trusting culture and not give in to fear following the horrendous and unprecedented acts of violence.
"As we rebuild the government quarters and [Labor Party youth wing] AUF builds up its organization, we will also restore a Norway based on openness and trust," the left-leaning daily Dagbladet said in an editorial.
"Yesterday, tragedy and fear hit Norway," broadsheet Aftenposten said in an editorial. Yet, it said the horror and grief must not make Norwegian society sacrifice its openness and freedom out of fear of new attacks. "It is worth keeping in mind that even countries with extreme security measures and unrestricted police authority are hit by terror," the daily said.
"We shall not have a Norway with new restrictions of freedom of movement, more uniforms, and thus also more interventions in the lives of all those of us who don't want to understand the language of terror," daily Dagbladet said.
Meanwhile, business daily Dagens Naeringsliv said Norway should maintain its open and democratic ways even as Friday's attacks may force the country to rethink its position on security.


New Smog Rules Delayed Again
WASHINGTON—Amid pressure from companies and Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday postponed new smog standards for the fourth time but said it plans to issue the rules soon.
The new standards for ozone, a primary component of smog, are still being reviewed by the White House, EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said in a statement. As a result, the EPA won't publish the standards by Friday, the date the agency had intended.
Tuesday's announcement is the fourth time the EPA has delayed the ozone rule in less than a year and comes amid lobbying from business groups that want the White House to push EPA to postpone the rules. On Monday, 34 senators wrote EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and asked for a delay until at least 2013, when the agency will be required to revisit the standard anyway. The senators said the economic impact of the proposal is "highly concerning."
Breathing ozone can cause respiratory problems and worsen lung conditions such as asthma. American Lung Association President Charles D. Connor said Tuesday the group was "gravely disappointed" by the delay. "There is no possible acceptable excuse for this decision," he said in a statement.
The Bush administration set the ozone standard at 75 parts per billion in 2008 but faced lawsuits because that number was outside a range recommended by EPA's scientific advisers. Ms. Jackson has said the Bush standard is "not legally defensible" and decided to change it.


Cypriot Cabinet Prepares for Shake-Up
Cyprus's cabinet resigned on Thursday in preparation for a shuffle aimed at holding together a fragile governing coalition in the face of growing public anger over a munitions blast that has dramatically escalated the island's economic crisis.
Government spokesman Stefan Stefanou said President Dimitris Christofias would shuffle his 11-member cabinet "soon" following consultations with the government's coalition partners and other parties.
"It is a move for the president to seek to appoint a government of wider acceptance to achieve consensus on economic measures and to restore public trust," Mr. Stefanou said. The political shake-up, which had been expected, comes after the ministers of defense and foreign affairs resigned and a junior coalition partner told its ministers to quit the government.
The news feeds fears that the island nation could be the next euro-zone country to need a bailout. Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded Cyprus by two notches and warned it may cut the rating further, citing the country's weak fiscal position, fractious political climate and close ties to the economy of fiscally stressed Greece.
The island's economic troubles have been compounded by rolling blackouts after an explosion destroyed the country's largest power station this month. Moody's said the blast caused "material disruption" to the country's midterm prospects, and cut its growth forecast to zero from 1.8%. Cyprus's central bank governor last week warned that the blast may force Cyprus to seek a bailout if deep spending cuts aren't made swiftly.


Can Washington Fix Things? Debt Panel Is First Test
Friday's downgrade of U.S. government debt raises pressure on a special "super committee" that lawmakers formed this week to try—once again—to reach a far-reaching budget deal.
In its downgrade announcement, Standard & Poor's said it was taking action based largely on Washington's constant political bickering and fiscal half measures. Based on the rancorous debate that just concluded, S&P predicted future deliberations would remain "a contentious and fitful process."
How Washington's political culture responds to that charge could be one of the more important repercussions of the downgrade, outside the reactions of financial markets. And the special debt committee stands as the capital's first test: Will lawmakers and the administration redouble their efforts to reach a broad budget-cutting deal or again descend into squabbles?
In the next 10 days, legislative leaders will choose 12 senators and representatives—six from each party—to fashion a deal by year end. Congress formed the committee in order to come up with the bulk of the $2.4 trillion in savings envisioned by this week's stopgap deal.
In a classic Washington punt, the special committee became part of the solution after lawmakers found themselves unable to agree on difficult long-term entitlement and tax issues.


One of These Men Is Wrong
Quoted: "The agreement removes the threat of default and lowers the prospect of using the debt limit as an instrument of coercion. It should not be possible for a small minority to threaten catastrophe if the rest of the government decides not to embrace an extreme agenda of austerity."
--Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
Aug. 3, 2011
Also quoted: "What we have done..is set a new template. In the future, any president, this one or another one, when they request us to raise the debt ceiling, it will not be clean anymore.. We will go through the process again and see what we can continue to achieve in connection with these debt-ceiling requests of presidents to get our financial house in order."
--Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell
Aug. 1, 2011
Reality: They can't both be right. Either Mr. Geithner is right that the debt-limit deal will usher in a new era of cooperation in Washington, or Mr. McConnell is right that we'll have continuous warfare over the budget.


Put Politics Aside, Obama Says
U.S. President Barack Obama used his weekly radio address to the nation to urge Congress to put politics aside and pass a series of measures to jolt the economy.
"There are things we can do right now that will mean more customers for businesses and more jobs across the country," Mr. Obama said just as he finished a three-day tour through the Midwest and headed to a vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Some of those ideas include extending a payroll-tax cut and introduction of a road-construction bill.
He said later, "The only thing preventing us from passing these bills is the refusal by some in Congress to put country ahead of party."
Mr. Obama used a version of that line several times on this three-day tour through Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa. The White House pitched his trip as a chance for the president to hear from regular folks struggling through the down-and-out economy. But it had the feel of a campaign with frequent unexpected stops at local restaurants, ice cream shops and high school football practices.
The president has said he will pitch to Congress in September a new economic plan that includes measures to both cut spending and lift taxes. He'll be facing a Republican Party that says it objects to raising taxes because it would only hamper the economy.


Turkish Airstrikes Kill Civilians, Iraq Says
ANKARA, Turkey—Turkish airstrikes on suspected rebel targets in northern Iraq killed seven civilians Sunday, Iraqi officials said.
The mayor of the town of Qalat Diza, Hassan Abdullah, and Capt. Ali Mohammed of the Iraqi army's border guards, said seven Iraqi civilians died in an attack on Kortak mountain, located on Mount Qandil, near the Iraqi-Iranian border. The two officials said the bodies were charred and dismembered.
Firat, a news agency close to the Kurdish rebels, also said seven people, including five children and a woman, were killed in a car while trying to flee raids on the village of Golle, on Qandil. The agency had reported that six people died in the raid, but later raised the number to seven.
Turkish warplanes have been striking at suspected rebel positions across the border in Iraq since Wednesday. The military has confirmed three days of strikes so far, but Kurdish groups also reported bombings by Turkish jets on Saturday and Sunday.
Turkey's latest offensive follows stepped-up attacks by the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, that have killed some 40 soldiers since July.


France Calls for Libya Meeting
PARIS—The French government Monday called for an extraordinary meeting to set up aid and support for the Libyan leadership that appears likely to take over from Col. Moammar Gadhafi's government.
The call came after French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke with Mahmoud Jabril, head of Libya's National Transitional Council, and invited him to France on Wednesday.
Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppé said at a news conference that the French government wants to hold a meeting of the contact group—an informal gathering of countries supporting the transitional council—"at the highest level" in Paris as soon as next week to discuss the situation in Libya and the need to build a democracy there.
"The [National] Transitional Council will need the international community's support and aid, and we are determined to commit to its support," Mr. Juppé said. "Libya has resources and is a potentially rich country and needs help to foster a democratic and prosperous future."
During the meeting, the contact group and its partners, which may include the United Nations, the European Union, the Arab League, the African Union and the U.S., will establish a sort of road map for the "construction of a new Libya," Mr. Juppé said.


Danes to Go to Polls in September
COPENHAGEN—Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen on Friday called an early general election for Sept. 15 to back a mandate for fiscal reforms and a proposed growth stimulus package aimed at pulling the country out of economic recession.
The step came after talks for a 10.8 billion Danish kroner ($2.05 billion) growth package between the minority government and its parliamentary partner, the anti-immigration Danish People's Party, fell apart a day earlier. Mr. Loekke Rasmussen's center-right coalition government doesn't have an outright majority and can't pass legislation without support from other parties.
Recent opinion polls indicate Mr. Loekke Rasmussen and his Liberal Party are taking a significant political gamble.
The opposition parties, led by the center-left Social Democrats, have a commanding lead of 54.1% against the ruling block's 43.8%, according to a recent poll by market research firm Voxmeter.
A regime change at the coming election would fit the historic trend in Danish politics, with a shift in power about once every decade. Mr. Loekke Rasmussen has been prime minister since taking over in 2009 from fellow Liberal Party member Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who became Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but the government coalition has ruled since 2001.


Atlantic City Evacuation Tasks Jersey Leadership
EWING, N.J.—New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised the one million state residents he said had evacuated, though he noted there were a few "hiccups" in the response.
In particular, some seniors in Atlantic City were resisting evacuation from high-rise buildings, despite coaxing from emergency officials, he said.
Mr. Christie described a story he had been told of a 92-year-old woman refusing to leave who said, "If I die, so be it."
"It's very difficult to respond to that," he said.
In his third briefing in two days, Mr. Christie warned that although the storm has slowed down and lost some strength, the state should still expect six to 12 inches of rain, major flooding and property damages.


U.S. Nominates Ambassador to Ecuador
QUITO—President Barack Obama named Adam E. Namm as ambassador to Ecuador, five months after the two countries expelled each other's envoys in a row over Wikileaks cables.
The White House confirmed Mr. Namm's nomination in a news release. In Ecuador on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said that in August Washington had requested Ecuador's approval before proceeding with the nomination, which was forthcoming.
The appointment of Mr. Namm requires approval from the U.S. Senate.
In April, Ecuador declared the U.S. ambassador to Ecuador, Heather M. Hodges, persona non grata and asked her to leave the country. Two days later, in a retaliatory move, the U.S. expelled Ecuador's ambassador in Washington, Luis Gallegos.
Ms. Hodges was asked to leave Ecuador following the release of a diplomatic cable from Wikileaks that was published by Spanish newspaper El Pais. In the 2009 cable, Ms. Hodges discussed widespread corruption in Ecuador's police and alleged that President Rafael Correa had knowledge of corruption among police leadership.


San Diego Geography Raises Blackout Risk
San Diego is vulnerable to electricity-supply disruptions because it is cut off on two sides by the Pacific Ocean and Mexico, reducing potential transmission corridors that could serve it.
Expensive real estate and tight air-emission standards also make it difficult to build more power plants there.
A 2009 study by the Department of Energy identified San Diego and other parts of Southern California as in need of more transmission lines and additional forms of electricity generation.
Some relief is coming, but only slowly. Sunrise Powerlink, a large, new transmission line, is expected to enter service in mid-2012. It was delayed by about two years by opposition from San Diego-area residents, and others, who didn't like the proposed route, fearing it would hurt property values and the quality of life. They filed more than a dozen legal challenges. San Diego Gas & Electric Co., the builder, hired extra construction workers to prevent an even longer delay.
The more power plants and transmission lines there are, to serve a city, the more reliable will be the power supply. If one route to deliver power is cut off, others can be utilized.


French Police Question Strauss-Kahn
PARIS—Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was questioned by French police over accusations of attempted rape made against him by a novelist, a lawyer for the French politician said.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who returned from the U.S. a week ago after separate sex-assault charges against him were formally dismissed by a New York judge, was questioned as a witness, his lawyer Henri Leclerc said.
Paris prosecutors are conducting a preliminary probe into allegations made by novelist Tristane Banon, who accused Mr. Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape her in February 2003, when the writer went to see him for an interview for a book.
Through Mr. Leclerc, Mr. Strauss-Kahn has called Ms. Banon's story "a figment of her own imagination" and filed a complaint for slander. Ms. Banon has said she maintains her accusations.
After their preliminary investigation, Paris prosecutors can designate an investigating magistrate to conduct a criminal probe or dismiss the complaint. A conviction for attempted rape carries a sentence of as much as 15 years in prison in France, where the statute of limitations for such crimes is 10 years.


Uganda Frees Kenyan Rights Activist
KAMPALA, Uganda—Uganda's high court Monday freed a prominent Kenyan human rights activist who had been held since last year over charges in connection with the July 11, 2010, terror attack in Kampala that left 79 people dead, officials said.
Al-Amin Kimathi, executive director of the Kenya-based Muslim Human Rights Forum, was freed after the director of public prosecutions said the state was no longer interested in pursuing terrorism charges against him, court officials said.
At least four other suspects were also released following the start of the trial of suspects believed to have carried out the attacks on football fans watching the World Cup final on television in Kampala. At least one American was killed in the twin blasts, in a bar and at an Ethiopian restaurant.
Mr. Kimathi, along with his co-accused, was facing 79 counts of murder and 15 counts of attempted murder in relation to the attacks. Fourteen suspects remain on trial.
The presiding judge said that although the state had dropped the charges against the suspects, the state prosecutor is still at liberty to prefer any other charges, if deemed necessary.


U.N. Releases Libyan Assets
Even as fighting continued in parts of Libya, the United Nations on Friday took steps to help the country's transitional government on its feet, including loosening sanctions against the country and paving the way for a U.N. mission to Libya.
To spur the country's economy, the U.N. security council passed a resolution unfreezing assets of two Libyan oil companies as well as of several Libyan financial institutions, including the country's central bank and the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank. It also lifted restrictions on Libyan commercial air travel, as well as specified ways other funds could be unfrozen.
The resolution does not unfreeze any of the billions of dollars of assets belonging to Col. Moammar Gadhafi or his family.
"This is to mark the transition from war to peace," said Peter Wittig, Germany's ambassador to the U.N., in an interview before the vote. "To help get the NTC moving."
The measure does not affect the military operations in the country, such as a previous U.N. resolution mandating a "no-fly" zone, which led to airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi. It loosens the arms embargo on the country, allowing weapons for security purposes for U.N staff and other officials.


Ukraine President Signals He May Yield on Tymoshenko
KIEV, Ukraine—President Viktor Yanukovych hinted Friday he might yield to increasing Western pressure and end the trial of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by changing Ukraine's criminal code.
Speaking at a conference in Yalta, Mr. Yanukovych distanced himself from the trial of the opposition leader, calling it "very painful." He said he hoped that the criminal code would be "modernized" this year. Political analysts said such an overhaul could decriminalize the article under which Ms. Tymoshenko is being tried.
The criminal code dates to 1962, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, the president said. "That, undoubtedly, is nonsense," he said, according to a transcript of his remarks posted on his website.
The prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko has threatened to hamper Mr. Yanukovych's push for deeper economic and political ties with the European Union. Ms. Tymoshenko is accused of exceeding her authority as prime minister by allegedly ordering a subordinate to sign an unfavourable gas-purchase contract with Russia in 2009.
EU and U.S. officials have raised concerns that the trial appears politically motivated. Senior European politicians have warned that the failure to free Ms. Tymoshenko could lead to refusal by parliaments of some EU states to ratify an association agreement.


A Ride to Aid Research for Dystonia, Parkinson's
Nancy Silverman still remembers the Tuesday night when she arrived at a school in town to be greeted by neighbors, friends, teachers and local officials. They gathered to support her family after her son, Jake, was diagnosed with dystonia, a devastating neurological muscle disorder.
Mrs. Silverman was overwhelmed. "I just put my head down and cried," she says.
Out of that meeting in 2007 came a plan developed by neighbor David Gardner to begin a fund-raiser and bike ride in support of Jake. Now in its fourth year, the Jake's Ride activities support the Bachmann-Strauss Dystonia & Parkinson Foundation.
Money raised goes toward research for the movement disorders dystonia and Parkinson's disease. Dystonia causes uncontrollable, painful spasms in one or more parts of the body and there is no known cure.
This Sunday's ride in Short Hills, N.J., is expected to push the total raised by the foundation past the $1 million mark. Previous rides and fund-raisers—including neighborhood children hosting lemonade stands and donating money earned by shoveling snow—have raised about $760,000.


Romney's Debate Character
Mitt Romney is being pronounced the winner by acclamation of Thursday night's GOP presidential debate, and that seems right to me too. After so many campaigns, he's a practiced debater, well-briefed on the issues, an excellent counter-puncher who knows what he wants to say. He also projects confidence, which is reassuring to voters.
He had every reason to be confident going against Rick Perry, who has performed worse in each successive debate. The Texas governor even muffed his attack lines on Mr. Romney's shifting policy positions. He sounds like a candidate who's been stuffed with so much new information that he's lost his swagger. The difference between Mr. Romney's five years of presidential campaign preparation and Mr. Perry's five weeks shows.
On the other hand, the former Massachusetts governor also revealed the part of his political character that has caused many Republicans to wonder about his convictions. As my colleague Dan Henninger notes, his answers all sound as if they've been crafted from polling data. He hits China on trade because hitting China is popular. He sounds almost evangelical about repealing ObamaCare though he presided over its precursor in Massachusetts and was missing in action during the epic fight over its passage.
He's especially adept at simply ignoring nettlesome questions, as he did in leaping over Bret Baier's query about whether he was dodging a fight on class warfare by proposing to cut capital gains tax rates only for single taxpayers making less than $200,000. All politicians do this to some extent, but it is Mr. Romney's particular talent.
One irony of the race so far is that Mr. Perry's entry has helped Mr. Romney. The rest of the GOP candidates have ganged up on the Texan, leaving Mr. Romney as a secondary target. Everyone else is competing to be the main alternative to Mr. Romney coming out of Iowa. That may change when such a challenger does emerge, or if Chris Christie gets in the race, but so far Mr. Romney couldn't have scripted this campaign better.


Want to Succeed? Stop Trying So Hard
"What's eight times eight?" I asked Isabelle, my 9-year-old daughter who was practicing her times tables. Her eyes glazed over.
We were on a plane and had about two hours to kill. I figured running through the twos to the twelves would take about 20 minutes.
But we were 40 minutes into the task and still at it.
The first 10 minutes had gone smoothly; with quick, accurate replies she was well on her way to finishing in our allotted time.
But as we continued, each question took longer to answer. It wasn't that the questions were getting harder -- I had mixed up the tables, interspersing easy questions with harder ones -- so what was it?


Man Charged in Pentagon, Capitol Plot
WASHINGTON—U.S. authorities arrested and charged a man who allegedly plotted attacks on the Pentagon with a remote-controlled model airplane packed with explosives, and on the U.S. Capitol with grenades and rifles.
Rezwan Ferdaus, a 26-year-old U.S. citizen, was arrested Wednesday after he met with undercover federal agents to inspect what he believed were an arsenal of explosives and firearms to be used in his alleged plot, U.S. prosecutors said.
Federal prosecutors said Mr. Ferdaus, of Ashland, Mass., is a graduate of Northeastern University with a degree in physics. He provided to people he believed were al Qaeda recruiters mobile phones modified to act as detonators for improvised explosives, intending them to be used against U.S. soldiers overseas, federal authorities alleged in a criminal complaint affidavit.
Mr. Ferdaus didn't know his alleged co-plotters were undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who were conducting a sting operation, according to Justice Department prosecutors. The agents provided fake explosives and the plot was never close to fruition, authorities said.
Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, said Mr. Ferdaus "had long planned to commit violent acts against our country."


Law of the Sea Treaty May Deliver More Than Expected
I agree with Edwin Williamson that the Law of the Sea Treaty "should not be blindly ratified" ("Law of the Sea Treaty is Good for U.S.," Letters, Oct. 6). Yet Mr. Williamson reveals too much about his pro-LOST thesis by the proffered condition that it not be "blindly ratified." He says that "if combined with reform of our domestic energy policy," ratification of this relic from the days of ascendant socialism is a worthy endeavor. Two cheers for this implicit acknowledgment that, at least without first attaining that undefined yet inarguably daunting technicality, LOST ratification should not be considered.
This also reminds one of a particularly treacherous aspect of the pact not addressed by John Bolton and Dan Blumenthal in their Sept. 29 piece to which Mr. Williamson responds.
Sec. 207, "Pollution from land-based sources," reveals that LOST is a sweeping regime cracking down on all activities arguably depositing pollutants into the seas. Under the precautionary principle, which LOST adopts, allegation is sufficient to establish the offense. With "ocean acidification" the latest nominee to supplant troubled CO2-warming theory, LOST supplants the failed Koyoto Treaty. It invites attacks on, e.g., America's transport and energy policies, claiming our cars and coal-fired power plants contribute to the latest claimed phenomenon, "acidification."
Sec. 213, "Enforcement with respect to pollution from land-based sources," ultimately rests with LOST's own tribunal. That is a power grab not even the Kyoto Treaty dared attempt. The U.S. rejects Kyoto; why would we join Kyoto with a court? In a rational world, thus ends renewed discussion about America ratifying LOST. In the real world, the best we can hope for is an honest debate, followed by burial of this titanic mistake at sea.

Shooting Near Indonesian Mine Kills 3
TIMIKA, Indonesia -- Gunmen shot and killed three miners in the latest attack near the world's largest gold mine in eastern Indonesia, officials said Saturday. Attackers also fired on a patrol car wounded en route to investigate, wounding a soldier and a civilian guard.
Four Indonesian miners who worked for the U.S. company Freeport were hit by unknown gunmen as their car traveled along a road to the mining complex on Friday in restive Papua province, local deputy police chief Maj. Mada Indra Laksanta said.
The attackers also set their car ablaze, he said.
Hours later, gunshots were fired at a patrol car trying to approach the burned car. A soldier and a civilian guard were wounded.
Police found the bodies of three miners near their car, and they are still searching for another miner unaccounted for.


Obama Nominates Official to Lead FHA
WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday he would nominate Carol Galante, an administration official since early 2009 and a former affordable-housing developer, as commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.
The FHA doesn't make loans directly, but guarantees them against default in exchange for insurance premiums paid by homeowners. It backs nearly $1 trillion in mortgages and has seen its market share soar dramatically since over the past three years as private lenders fled the U.S. mortgage market.
As a result, the FHA commissioner's job is now one of the most prominent posts in the housing industry. The previous commissioner, David Stevens, left the administration in March to become chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Ms. Galante, 57, has been acting head of the FHA since July. The post requires Senate confirmation.
Ms. Galante formerly oversaw the FHA's multifamily lending operations, which have grown sharply over the past two years. The agency has played an even bigger role backing single-family mortgages.


Politics of Pullout Not Without Risk
The withdrawal of troops from Iraq offers the promise of a political boost for President Barack Obama on national security, but not without risks.
It's likely to be welcomed by many war-weary Americans, particularly core Democratic voters, many of whom were first attracted to Mr. Obama because of his early opposition to the Iraq war.
It also opens the president to criticism that the troop withdrawal provides an opening for Iran to exert greater regional influence.
"We are confident that we can protect our interests in the region, secure the stability of the region without having bases in Iraq," said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser at the White House.
Some Republicans Friday said the U.S.'s inability to reach agreement with Iraq about the presence of U.S. troops—the key reason for the year-end pull-out—was a sign of weakness.


Peru Coast Rattled by Quake
LIMA–A strong earthquake rattled Peru's central coast on Friday, sending thousands of residents of Lima and other cities into the streets. There there are no immediate reports of major damage or injuries.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the 6.9 magnitude earthquake was centered 32 miles (52 kilometers) south of Ica and about 180 miles southeast of the capital Lima.
RPP radio reported that there was widespread panic but few reports of serious damage from the coastal city of Ica. The area around Ica was badly damaged in an August, 2007 earthquake.
An official with base metals miner Southern Copper Corp. said that so far there was no news about any damage. Its mines are located in the southern regions of Peru.


Court Affirms Ruling That FCC Wrongly Fined CBS
WASHINGTON—A federal appeals court on Wednesday for the second time ruled that the Federal Communications Commission improperly fined CBS Corp. for airing singer Janet Jackson's infamous Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction" in 2004.
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals, ruling again after the Supreme Court remanded the case in 2009, upheld its previous decision that the agency didn't provide broadcasters fair warning about a change in indecency enforcement rules.
The case involves a $550,000 fine on CBS for airing a Super Bowl halftime show featuring Ms. Jackson during which her breast was momentarily displayed after part of her costume was torn away. The FCC fined CBS for the breast flash, coined a "wardrobe malfunction" at the time, which lasted less than a second. The broadcaster appealed the FCC fine in 2006.
In the 2-1 opinion released Wednesday, the Third Circuit panel said the FCC erred by failing "to acknowledge that its order in this case reflected a policy change and improperly imposed on a penalty on CBS for violating a previously unannounced policy."
The panel found that the FCC in the Jackson case departed from a nearly 30-year practice of giving broadcasters a pass if an infraction occurred in a live broadcast. Although the FCC frowned on such slip-ups, it refrained from fining TV or radio broadcasters for unscripted flubs.


Attacks in Nigeria Leave 69 Dead
LAGOS, Nigeria—At least 69 people died in a wave of bombings and shootings carried out in northeast Nigeria overnight, officials said Saturday, as frightened mourners left their homes to begin burying their dead.
There was no claim of responsibility, but blame immediately fell on the sect known as Boko Haram, which has staged targeted assassinations and bombings around Nigeria's north.
The attacks centered on Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, Nigerian Red Cross official Ibrahim Bulama said. The attack started Friday, with a car bomb exploding outside a three-story building used as a military office and barracks in the city, with many uniformed security agents dying in the blast, Mr. Bulama said.
Gunmen then went through the town, blowing up a First Bank PLC branch and attacking at least three police stations and some churches, leaving them in rubble, he said. Gunfire continued through the night,0 and gunmen raided the village of Potiskum near the capital as well, witnesses said, leaving at least two people dead there.
On Saturday morning, people began hesitantly leaving their homes, seeing the destruction left behind, including military and police vehicles burned by the gunmen, with the burned corpses of the drivers who died in their seats.


General Removed for Karzai Remarks
KABUL—A senior U.S. military commander in Afghanistan was relieved of duty Friday night for making disparaging comments about the country's president and its top leadership, the U.S.-led coalition said.
The decision to remove Maj. Gen. Peter Fuller, deputy commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission to train Afghan forces, was made by the coalition commander, U.S. Gen. John Allen.
Gen. Fuller told the news web site Politico in an interview published Thursday that Afghanistan's leaders were ungrateful for U.S. assistance and "isolated from reality." The U.S. has given some $20 billion in 2010 and 2011 to train and equip Afghanistan's security forces, on top of many billions more in development assistance.
Gen. Fuller also described recent comments by President Hamid Karzai as "erratic" and said he hoped the Afghan leader would be succeeded by "a guy that's more articulate in public."
Gen. Allen rejected Gen. Fuller's remarks as "inappropriate" and praised the Afghans as "an honorable people."


Two More Indicted in Bhutto Killing
ISLAMABAD—Two police officers were indicted Saturday in the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and will face trial along with five members of the Pakistani Taliban, a state prosecutor said.
The policemen were charged with failing to provide Ms. Bhutto with proper security and with destroying evidence, said the prosecutor, Zulfikar Ali. Their indictment triggers a new trial for the Taliban members so that all seven defendants can be tried together, he said.
Ms. Bhutto and 23 other people were killed on Dec. 27, 2007, in a gun and suicide bomb attack as she was leaving a rally in the garrison town of Rawalpindi. She was campaigning there to return her Pakistan People's Party to power in parliamentary elections just weeks after returning to the country from years in self-imposed exile.
A United Nations commission said the assassination could have been prevented, and blamed all levels of government for failing to provide adequate security. It also accused intelligence agencies and other officials of severely hampering the investigation into those behind her murder.
The two police officers are accused of ordering the crime scene to be hosed down within minutes in what investigators believe was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence, the prosecutor said.


Japan Lower House Passes $156 Billion Extra Budget
TOKYO—Japan's lower house of parliament on Thursday passed a ¥12.1 trillion (about $156 billion) supplementary budget for post-quake reconstruction and for spending meant to cushion the economic impact of the strong yen.
The ruling Democratic Party of Japan won cooperation from opposition parties by accommodating many of their demands, such as by extending the maturity of government bonds aimed at financing the budget. The budget will now move to the upper house.
The DPJ aims to enact the bill and related legislation before the end of the month, as it looks to quickly implement measures to rebuild areas hit by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and mitigate the effects of the strong yen on the nation's key export sector. Legislative compromises by the DPJ have become the norm, as opposition parties control the upper chamber and effectively hold veto over bills other than the budget. Without opposition support, the ruling camp can't enact bills linked to the latest spending plan, such as legislation to raise taxes to pay down the debt over 25 years. Negotiations are continuing between the DPJ and the opposition Liberal Democratic and New Komeito parties, with no agreement yet on as whether to include higher levies on cigarettes in the tax bill.

Report Blames Mexican Security Forces For Abuse
MEXICO CITY–Mexico's police and soldiers have committed widespread human rights abuses in the government's fight against organized crime, according to a report published on Wednesday.
In the most comprehensive review of human rights violations since the start of the drug war, the 212-page report by Human Rights Watch said it found strong evidence of participation of security forces in 170 cases of torture, 39 disappearances, and 24 incidents of extrajudicial killings.
"Instead of reducing violence, Mexico's 'war on drugs' has resulted in a dramatic increase in killings, torture, and other appalling abuses by security forces, which only make the climate of lawlessness and fear worse in many parts of the country," said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.
Mr. Vivanco and other members of Human Rights Watch delivered to Mexican President Felipe Calderón, members of Mexico's Congress and the Supreme Court.
In a statement, Mr. Calderón's office said he would appoint a committee to review the document. But in the rest of the statement, Mr. Calderón defended Mexico's rights record and said it was the "criminals" who pose the greatest threat to human rights in the country.


Putin Takes Issue With Western Powers
MOSCOW—Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister and presumed next president, took a tough stance against the West, strongly criticizing the U.S. plans for missile defense, the military campaign in Libya and Europe's energy policies that he said were seeking to squeeze Russia out of the European energy market.
The remarks at an annual dinner he has held in recent years with foreign academics and journalists—his first such encounter since announcing his candidacy for the presidency in elections in March—suggest his second spell as president will see no softening of the often-harsh criticism of Western policies that marked his first period in office. He and current President Dmitry Medvedev announced in September that they had agreed that Mr. Putin would run.
Mr. Putin kept the pressure on the U.S., hinting that Russia would respond with extra nuclear-missile deployments if the U.S. went ahead with plans to build a missile defense system that he said appeared to be designed to neutralize Russia's nuclear deterrent. "We believe that the establishment of a missile defense system is a threat to our nuclear potential and we will be compelled to respond," he said.
The U.S. says the system is designed to deal with the threat of attack from Iran.
Mr. Putin accused the U.S. of being interested in relations with Moscow because Russia was the only country that could destroy the U.S. in half an hour or less.


'My Shoes Are More Honorable'
Tensions over the bloody conflict in Syria reached late-night television in Lebanon Monday night, when a discussion between two Lebanese politicians culminated in curses and near-blows with office chairs. (Watch the clip.)
The unrest in Syria—a strategic Middle Eastern country that has enjoyed considerable influence in Lebanon—has already polarized Lebanese society. Lebanese have long feared that if Syria descends into sectarian violence, the tensions will spill over into their own country: The country's Shiites largely support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while its Sunnis and many Christians tend to back the anti-government protestors.
Mr. Assad's response to his country's uprising was the subject of Bi Mawdouya—or "Be Objective"—a live talk show aired on Lebanon's independent MTV network late Monday. It paired former parliamentarian Moustafa Alloush, a critic of Mr. Assad's regime, with Fayez Shukur, the head of the Lebanese branch of Syria's ruling Baath party.
Mr. Shukur, the Assad supporter, accused his counterpart of not listening. "I wish you'd listen to the speech of President Assad," Mr. Shukur said.
Mr. Alloush countered that he had listened—but he had lost confidence in Mr. Assad "because he is a liar."


Concealed-Weapons Bill Passes in House
WASHINGTON—House lawmakers easily approved legislation on Wednesday that would require states to observe concealed-weapons permits issued by other state governments in a victory for Second Amendment champions in Congress.
In a bipartisan 272-154 vote, more than 40 Democrats joined with nearly every Republican in voting to support the bill.
Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, likened the bill to requiring states to recognize other states' driving licenses. He said that 49 states already extend some degree of reciprocity to permits issued by other jurisdictions.
"This landmark legislation recognizes the importance of the Second Amendment and makes it easier for individuals with concealed carry permits to travel to other states," Mr. Smith said during debate on the House floor.
But opponents to the measure decried both the timing of the vote as well as the fact it forces other states' gun laws on those with more restrictive gun statutes.


John A. Hall: Investigate the Khmer Rouge Tribunal
The scandal-plagued and U.N.-backed Khmer Rouge Tribunal is finally on the brink of beginning the trials of four elderly senior members of the regime responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.8 million Cambodians from 1975-79. Unfortunately, the credibility of the tribunal has been rocked by the serious judicial misconduct of the two co-investigating judges, German Siegfried Blunk, and Cambodian You Bunleng. An independent investigation is now desperately needed to restore confidence in the legitimacy of the legal process.
Messrs. Blunk and You had responsibility to investigate five additional suspects accused by the international prosecutor of mass murder and serious crimes against humanity. It is hard to imagine a remit more serious for any judge. Yet they persistently undermined the investigative process.
The two judges closed down the investigations prematurely without having summoned, charged or questioned the suspects; without meeting with key witnesses; and without having conducted significant field inquiries. Their Cambodian staff reportedly stuffed paper into the case files just to give the illusion that investigations had taken place. In short, they presided over an egregious violation of their legal and judicial duties in violation of U.N. standards and international legal norms.
Thankfully, Mr. Blunk resigned last month. But that cannot be the end of the matter.
The New York-based Open Society Justice Initiative, a long-time watchdog of the tribunal, has just released a report concerning the allegations of judicial misconduct and political interference, and has called on the U.N. to appoint an independent panel of three international judges to conduct a full inquiry into the allegations. This is exactly what is needed. It is doubtful, however, that the U.N. has the stomach for it.


Officials Order Shutdown of 27 Miles of Gas Pipeline in Ohio
HOUSTON--Federal officials have ordered the continued shutdown of 27 miles of natural gas pipeline in Ohio because of repeated problems with welds in the pipe, including one linked to an explosion that leveled several houses on Wednesday.
The investigation into the cause of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. LLC explosion near Glouster, Ohio, is continuing, according to an order released late Thursday by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
But authorities said that a visual inspection suggests that the pipeline failed at a weld similar to those that caused problems, including an explosion and fire in northeastern Ohio, in February and March. The high-pressure pipeline, three feet in diameter, runs from Kentucky to Pennsylvania.
"I find that the continued operation of the pipeline without corrective measures would be hazardous to life, property and the environment," wrote Jeffrey D. Wiese, associate administrator for pipeline safety at PHMSA.
Those measures include the shutdown, operating more than 200 miles of the affected line at reduced pressures, performing mechanical and metallurgical tests, and completing an analysis of the root cause of the failure within 60 days.


Greece's Budget Sets Ambitious Targets
ATHENS—Greece unveiled Friday its state budget for 2012, setting ambitious deficit-slashing targets the country has promised creditors that may be challenged by a deepening recession, even as it ruled out additional austerity measures.
The budget, which is to be voted on in parliament Dec. 7, confirms that Greece will miss its 2011 deficit targets with a gap equal to 9% of gross domestic product, and lays out two separate targets for next year depending on the outcome of a planned €100 billion debt writedown.
Passing the budget and implementing the debt write-down, are among the first tasks facing Greece's new coalition government, led by former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas Papademos.
Earlier this week the new government, which is backed by Greece's two major political parties—the majority Socialists and the opposition New Democracy—as well as the small, nationalist Laos party, was formally installed after winning a vote of confidence in parliament.
It takes over an economy mired in a four-year long recession, with output expected to decline 5.5% this year and another 2.8% next year, and comes amid rising unemployment and business bankruptcies. The budget forecasts match the official expectations of Greece's creditors—the European Union and the International Monetary Fund—but have already been revised several times this year.


Peace Corps to Exit Kazakhstan
ALMATY, Kazakhstan—The Peace Corps is ending its operations in Kazakhstan, its last major program in Central Asia, the agency said on Friday.
Afer the agency posted its decision on its website, Deputy Communications Director Kristina Edmunson said in an email that the suspension came after "several incidents in Kazakhstan in recent months involving individual volunteers" that she didn't detail.
A person familiar with the Corps' operations in the former Soviet republic in Central Asia said the pullout stemmed from concerns over sexual assaults and local terrorism, adding that the decision was made two days ago.
On Friday, Kazakhstan's ministry of education and science said, "Kazakhstan has achieved great progress in the political and socioeconomic development over the 20 years of its independence and today is a country with an income above average."
It added that Kazakhstan is now one of the most-developed countries in which the Peace Corps operates and added, "We believe that the suspension of the activities of the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan is a rather logical step."


Myanmar Shifts Gaze Toward West
Myanmar, long shunned by the West for its repressive regime, firmly moved into center position in a U.S.-China tug of war in the Asia-Pacific.
A series of reforms by the country's new government received two pivotal endorsements as the U.S. said it is sending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to visit the country and as the party led by the country's most famous dissident, Aung San Suu Kyi, moved to formally rejoin its electoral politics.
The moves reflect shifting attitudes both in the region and inside the White House, whose position evolved dramatically in just a few months.
Myanmar's thaw with the Washington comes after sanctions by the West had helped propel China to become the country's primary financial and political backer, aiding its battered finances with billions of dollars of investments in energy and other resources.
People familiar with the thinking of Myanmar's new government—which has surprised critics with the extent of its drive to open up and court Western approval—say it is at least partly driven by a desire to curb its heavy reliance on China, whose aggressive resource exploitation in the country has galvanized dissidents and other residents into shared anti-China sentiment, leading some leaders to worry about the prospect of wider protests that could destabilize the country.


Wife of France's Mitterrand Dies
PARIS—Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of the late French socialist President François Mitterrand and a human-rights activist, died early Tuesday aged 87 from respiratory failure, said Rita Cristofari, the spokeswoman for Ms. Mitterand's foundation France Libertés.
Ever since she participated in the resistance against the Nazi occupation of France as a teenager, Ms. Mitterrand defended grand causes related to human rights and the environment. She had met Mr. Mitterrand during World War II and they married shortly after France's liberation in 1944, according to the late president's institute.
The couple had three sons between 1945 and 1949, though their first born died when he was only three-months old. Her nephew Frédéric Mitterrand is France's Culture Minister in President Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing government.
During her years as France's first lady between 1981 and 1995, she publicly defended opponents to Latin American right-wing dictatorships, as well Palestinian leaders and antiapartheid activists in South Africa. Her positions gradually made her a standard-bearer for third-world causes. Some of her public positions sparked controversy, as when she overtly supported Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
Since her husband's death, she acted as unofficial administrator of his political legacy, and her opinions were widely respected within the Socialist Party. The former president—the only left-wing president elected in France since 1958 when the constitution mandated that the head of state be elected directly by voters—is still a towering figure for the French socialists.


Hill and Wihardja: Indonesia's Reform Reversal
Indonesia is the flavor of the month for investors, reflecting its upgraded investment ratings, political stability and abundant natural resources. At the same time, the gap between the official rhetoric extolling the virtues of open markets and globalization and the reality of politically motivated regulations is widening.
Powerful local business interests are lobbying the government for special favors. Rice can only be imported by ministerial decree, and for long periods there has been a blanket import ban. Meat imports are restricted for "biosecurity reasons," which not only benefits local farmers but also the inspecting firms. Only one firm is de facto permitted to import foreign movies.
More restrictions are in the pipeline. The export of raw rattan is about to be prohibited, which will benefit the rattan furniture industry. The import of salt is now prohibited on a seasonal basis, and allowed only subject to ministerial approval. The 2010 Horticulture Law stipulates that businesses have to give priority to local products. Service sector restrictions are proliferating across a wide range of business services and higher education.
The general business environment is also becoming more uncertain. Fiscal incentives are being introduced on an ad hoc basis and the criteria for their award are opaque. Insecurity of leases in the mining sector is in the headlines again following the case of Churchill Mining, whose license was suddenly revoked and transferred to a local company, Nusantara Group.
Moreover, interprovincial flows of goods and services are still subject to a range of legal and illegal levies. These barriers are one of the reasons why it is cheaper to ship rattan from the island of Sulawesi to China than to nearby Java.


Prosecutors Should Meet High Standards
Regarding Jim Morhard's "Are Prosecutors Above the Law?" (op-ed, Dec. 3): Perhaps the judge is extending unwarranted professional courtesy to the prosecutors. But these men are licensed, and the governing agency that issues licenses to practice the law would seem to be a first place to look for justice. I am a professional engineer, and the boards of registration that cover my licenses in various states have high standards and don't require a conviction to sanction offenders in the form of license suspensions and revocations. Shouldn't prosecutors who enforce the law on the rest of us be subject to the same standard?

Peru's Leader Names Cabinet Chief
LIMA -- President Ollanta Humala, facing a crisis over ongoing protests against his government's handling of a mining dispute, on Saturday accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Salomon Lerner Ghitis.
At the same time, Humala named his interior minister, Oscar Valdes, to become the new chief of cabinet, also known as prime minister. Like Humala, Valdes is a former military officer.
The cabinet shuffle comes as the administration of Humala, a 49-year-old nationalist, faces a wave of protests against projects in mining and in other sectors.
Political analysts say that Humala has faced an unusually large number of scandals and crises since taking office on July 28, which have started to undermine his popularity.
Lerner's resignation was unexpected, as he was close to Humala and helped finance his election campaign this year. Lerner, a businessman, was also seen as being a key link between Humala and the business community.


Indonesia Speeds Infrastructure Upgrade
JAKARTA—Indonesia's parliament approved a law Friday to speed up government acquisition of land for infrastructure, a step analysts say is crucial to kick-starting construction of needed roads, ports and power plants.
The new law will let the government acquire civilian land for such uses, as well as for the likes of airports, railways, dams and oil facilities, compensating landowners with cash, land or other forms of payment. It sets out time limits for project announcements and discussion, and establishes a legal process by which landowners and community members opposed to projects can be heard. Under the new law, the whole process must be finished in less than 18 months; today buying land for infrastructure projects can take five years or more.
"The law will smooth the development of public infrastructure," said lawmaker Daryatmo Mardiyanto, who chaired the special committee that drafted the bill. "It will provide legal certainty and fairness for the people."
While Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, could be the next Asian economy to take off, analysts say it has to address its overburdened infrastructure if it wants double-digit growth. Gross domestic product is projected to grow about 6.5% this year,
Ratings company Fitch on Thursday lifted Indonesia's rating to investment grade for the first time in 14 years, but also pointed to infrastructure bottlenecks as one of the biggest barriers to growth. Creating a process for quickly evicting reluctant landowners to make way for important projects is a step toward streamlining infrastructure construction and the economy as a whole, economists and executives said, and so creating jobs for the country's largely young population of around 240 million people.


World Watch
MOLDOVA
Separatist Region
Chooses New Leader
Yevgheny Shevchuk, a 43-year-old businessman and politician, has been elected president of the breakaway Moldovan region of Trans-Dniester, the separatists' official news agency said Monday.
Olvia-Pres quoted election officials saying Mr. Shevchuk won 73.9% of the vote to defeat Anatoly Kaminski, the candidate preferred by Russia, in Sunday's runoff.
Analysts have said it is too early to predict whether Russia would lose influence in the region as a result. Mr. Shevchuk is thought to have a more conciliatory stance toward Moldova and the government in Chisinau than his predecessor Igor Smirnov, who led Trans-Dniester for 20 years. Mr. Smirnov came in third in the first-round vote on Dec. 11.
Trans-Dniester broke away from Moldova in 1990 and fought a war with Moldovan forces in 1992 that left 1,500 people dead. The region, populated mainly by Ukrainians and Russians, isn't recognized internationally, but has its own legal and administrative system.
Moscow has traditionally wielded significant influence there, and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent Mr. Kaminski a letter of support prior to the runoff.


Egypt Raids Worry Targets
CAIRO—Egyptian and foreign human-rights workers largely turned to self-defense on Friday, a day after unprecedented raids on nongovernmental organizations left a chill over Egypt's already embattled civil-society community.
Thursday's raids came as the country nears the end of a six-week cycle of elections for its first post-revolutionary Parliament. Among those raided were the monitors for the three rounds of parliamentary elections, two of which have been completed.
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called Egyptian Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, on Friday to express "deep concern" about the raids, the Pentagon said
Some civil-society leaders said their newly defensive stance might rattle their election-monitoring plans. Heads of both Egyptian and American NGOs said Friday their organizations have temporarily shifted at least some of their resources away from defending human rights toward defending their own right to work and recovering essential equipment and data.
"Our immediate concerns in the wake of this are very minute-to-minute and logistical—focusing on the security of our people," said Charles Dunne, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Washington-based Freedom House, whose offices remain sealed after the raid Thursday.


Uganda Opposition Leader to Step Down
KAMPALA Uganda—Uganda's main opposition leader, who was detained and beaten several times as he led raucous anti-government street protests last year across the East African nation, is set to step down as leader of his party.
Supporters say Kizza Besigye's early retirement from politics is designed to send a message to his party and Ugandan people that politicians shouldn't cling to power. But others in the party and opposition movement saw the move as threatening to splinter Uganda's opposition against the country's strongman president.
Mr. Besigye, a three-time unsuccessful challenger for the Ugandan presidency, is expected to resign from his top post in the Forum for Democratic Change to make way for a suitable successor, said party official Anne Mugisha. His party term was set to run until 2014, but officials said they are expected to start the process of choosing a successor by the middle of this year.
"Kizza Besigye has already communicated to the party leadership that he won't seek re-election as party president," she said.
Mr. Besigye, 55, has become a symbol of African opposition politics, subjected to rough-and-tumble treatment familiar to many others who have challenged the continent's entrenched leaders.


Russia to Limit Kremlin Protests
MOSCOW—The Kremlin is tightening control over permits for rallies next to its walls, as the opposition plans a campaign of antigovernment protests around the March presidential elections.
"It looks like they are afraid of some kind of a storming of the Kremlin, which is a pure paranoia," said Dmitry Butrin, a journalist who is one of the organizers of the demonstrations. A Kremlin spokesman said it was just a routine change aimed at making the rules more consistent. He denied it was related to the demonstrations or an effort to prevent rallies in the area.
The Presidential Press Service announced the changes to the decree governing the Kremlin at its surroundings on Jan. 4, when Russia was shut down for its weeklong New Year's holiday. Under the new rules, permission from the presidential administration will be necessary for any public event on Vasilievsky Spusk, the cobblestone expanse along the Kremlin wall behind St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square.
Permits for events on the square have for decades required permission from the Kremlin administration, rather than just City Hall, which authorizes activities elsewhere in Moscow. The Kremlin spokesman said Vasilievsky Spusk is effectively part of Red Square and the rule change was aimed simply at unifying the regulations governing the historic Kremlin complex. "The process for applicants won't change," he said, noting that the timing of the change was "coincidental."
Official demonstrations on Red Square were commonplace in the Soviet era and in recent years it has hosted annual military parades. Political and other protests have been held elsewhere. Current Russian law doesn't require permits for demonstrations but mandates that organizers provide advance notification. Authorities have often used that process to block protests.


Marines' Training Gets Scrutiny After Video
WASHINGTON—Military investigators, widening a probe of four U.S. Marines depicted in a video urinating on Taliban corpses, will review the kind of training the Marines received in the standards of military conduct, officials said.
The decision to look into the training provided to the Marines was prompted both by the video apparently taken in Afghanistan and by unrelated testimony by a Marine staff sergeant this week that he had urinated on corpses in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005.
The review, which may also examine the command climate surrounding the four Marines in question, is separate from a criminal investigation into the actions of the four as shown in the video, officials said.
"Is there a belief in the Marines that it is OK to do this?" asked one military officer. "We believe these are isolated incidents, but that is what the investigation will look at."
The video, which first surfaced on YouTube and other websites on Wednesday, shows four Marines in Afghanistan urinating on three lifeless bodies. In the video, which runs less than a minute, one of the Marines is heard saying: "Have a great day, buddy."


Emanuele Ottolenghi: The Embargo That Can't Wait
Iran's recent threats to close the Strait of Hormuz have elicited worldwide concern about escalation in the Persian Gulf. The unrest along the strategic waterway has raised the specter of war and spiraling oil prices; Hormuz is the obligatory daily transit point for nearly 20% of world energy resources. Concern about escalation is so high that the Obama Administration this week postponed a scheduled joint military exercise with Israel, lest Tehran misread the event as a provocation or pretext for further escalation.
Don't believe Iran's hype. The fierce rhetoric is a reflection of the regime's impotence as a Western-led oil embargo looms. The bluff is an implicit admission of how much the regime fears the ultimate weapon in the Western sanctions toolkit.
Iran is threatening to close the Strait because it knows it can be squeezed out of the oil market without a significant long-term spike in oil prices. Even conflict would have a negligible impact.
For some time already, oil markets have factored in unrest in the Gulf and the risks of conflict with Iran over its nuclear program. Habitual buyers of Iranian oil, such as China and India, are unlikely to sign up to an oil embargo but have already begun scaling down their dependence on Iranian supplies.
Saudi production capacity is expected to make up for the shortfall of Iranian oil. A closure of the Strait will be short-lived—Iran's military capabilities are hardly formidable. Other Arab producers in the Gulf can divert oil to safer shores on the western side of the Arabian Peninsula if need be.


Matthew Kaminski: Mayor 'McSchwinn,' Loveless in Seattle
Seattle
Seattle's Patagonia-clad residents are known for their reserve and consensual nature, their green politics and generosity with tax dollars.
You might hear a note of dissent from Mike McGinn.
"It depends how you define liberal," he says of Seattle's politics now. "I've taken some hits, I've made some friends. I may discover that, as I put it, I'm not a career politician and I may discover I may not have a career in politics."


Malaysia Appeals Acquittal of Opposition Icon
Malaysian prosecutors Friday said they have filed an appeal against a recent court decision to acquit opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges, a move that could potentially plunge the nation into a fresh period of volatility ahead of its next elections.
The decision of the attorney general's office to appeal the Jan. 9 High Court ruling to acquit Mr. Anwar might also embarrass Prime Minister Najib Razak, who earlier described the verdict as proof that Malaysia's government doesn't try to sway politically-loaded court cases, as many of its critics have accused it of doing. Analysts say the appeal is likely to hurt Mr. Najib rather than help him by directing the spotlight back to the sex-based allegations against Mr. Anwar that have dominated this predominantly Muslim nation for years, rather than to Mr. Najib's own reforms.
Some political analysts suggest that while Malaysia's High Court has become more independent in recent years, it is still unclear whether the country's higher courts operate free of political interference. Government officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Mr. Najib has to call fresh elections by March 2013, and he could announce a vote much sooner than that under Malaysia's parliamentary system of government.
Political analysts say the acquittal of Mr. Anwar was in some ways the starting gun for the expected election campaign. Seemingly free of his legal troubles, Mr. Anwar, 64 years old, has now begun recalibrating his opposition alliance toward tackling the government's handling of the economy. The U.S. along with other key trading partners applauded the verdict, helping to cement a warming relationship with Malaysia.


Attacks in Nigeria Kill at Least 143
An Islamic militant group in Nigeria staged devastating bomb and gun assaults on government targets in the northern city of Kano, the latest in a series of attacks that appeared aimed at splitting Muslim and Christian communities in Africa's most populous country.
The attacks, which took place late Friday and Saturday, paired bomb blasts with shootings. An Associated Press count, based on hospital records, said that at least 143 people had died. A high-ranking Nigerian security official, who asked not to be identified, said the final toll may be higher than 200.
The Islamic militia Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the attack. A Boko Haram spokesman, with a nom de guerre of Abul Qaqa, said that, during the chaos, Boko Haram had freed several of its members who had been in police custody without a trial.
The group, whose name means "Western Education is Sacrilege," has long targeted government workers and buildings in Africa's most populous nation. But since last month, the group has also stepped up attacks on Christians living in the country's overwhelmingly Muslim north, in an apparent effort to sow divisions between the two groups.
Authorities blamed Boko Haram for at least 510 killings last year alone, according to an AP count. This year, the group had been blamed for 76 more—including two journalists—before Friday's attacks.


EU to Ease Myanmar Sanctions
The European Union agreed Monday to ease some sanctions on Myanmar, suspending visa bans against senior government officials, but it will maintain other restrictions against the Southeast Asian nation for now.
The EU said it will lift its visa bans against Myanmar's president, vice presidents, its cabinet and the speakers of the two Myanmar parliamentary houses. It also promised to boost assistance for poverty-alleviation programs in Myanmar as the country continues to undertake political reforms, and said further easing of sanctions will take place if those reforms continue. Other European sanctions include an arms embargo against Myanmar and restrictions on targeted industries such as timber and precious stones.
Europe "welcomes the remarkable program of political reform undertaken by the government and parliament in Myanmar, together with its commitment to economic and social development," the Council of the European Union said in a statement.
The EU's move comes as leaders across the Western world debate how far to go in rewarding Myanmar for a series of changes there after years of harsh military rule.
A new civilian government that took power in Myanmar last year after the country's first election in two decades has released hundreds of political prisoners, eased restrictions on the Internet, and legalized the country's main opposition party. It has also expanded dialogue with armed ethnic minority groups that have fought on-again, off-again wars with Myanmar's military for decades, among other steps.


Penn State Faculty Rejects No-Confidence Vote
STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Pennsylvania State University's faculty senate overwhelming rejected a no-confidence vote in the university board for its handling of child sexual abuse allegations against a former assistant football coach.
The senate said Tuesday it believed such a move, though symbolic, would be unnecessarily divisive at a time when the university needs to concentrate on unity. The senate also voted against creating a special committee to investigate the board's handling of the firing of head football coach Joe Paterno, who died over the weekend.
"This is confrontational and doesn't need to be," said Jean Pytel, an engineering professor and senate member, before the 119-56 vote against the no-confidence measure. "We need to work together on healing and figuring out what went wrong."
The vote came amid widespread alumni discontent over Mr. Paterno's firing in November, shortly after charges were brought against a former assistant coach, Jerry Sandusky, for allegedly sexually assaulting boys.
Mr. Paterno had been informed about an alleged incident on campus, reported it to school administrators but later said he wished he had "done more."


Payroll-Tax Break Divides Lawmakers
WASHINGTON—Congressional lawmakers on Tuesday signaled a broad desire to extend the payroll-tax break and federal jobless benefits for the rest of the year, but fault lines emerged early over how to pay for the measures and what other provisions should be folded into any agreement.
Democratic and Republican negotiators plunged back into the debate at their first public meeting Tuesday, offering diverging ideas over how to pay for the extensions—estimated to cost about $160 billion in total—as lawmakers embraced familiar proposals that failed to garner widespread bipartisan support last year.
Democrats again pushed for paying for the extensions with a surtax on annual incomes over $1 million—an idea that met stiff opposition last year from many Republicans.
"Fairness calls on us to ask those who have done the very best in the last years and decades to contribute a little more toward fiscal responsibility," said Rep. Sander Levin (D., Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, echoing comments made earlier Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.). "A fair way to do that is through a surtax on income over a million dollars."
Republicans immediately countered that this would punish those capable of creating more jobs.


RomneyCare and ObamaCare
Those of us who thought that Mitt Romney's health-care record would hurt him during the GOP primaries have been wrong so far, in part because the former Massachusetts governor has been so insistent that he'll "repeal ObamaCare." But this week his vulnerability came into sharper focus, and while it may not cost him the nomination it could cost him in November.
The GOP's health-care political opportunity was clear in this week's State of Union address, which included barely a passing mention of the subject. In private, Democrats speak of the Affordable Care Act as President Obama's signature achievement, his LBJ and FDR-level expansion of the entitlement state. But they also know it is unpopular with the public, more so now than it was when it passed, so they have all but put it into the federal witness protection program.
The question is whether the Republican nominee can exploit the issue. And on that score, Rick Santorum exposed a major Mitt Romney weakness in Thursday night's debate. Here's how he put it:
"What's happened in Massachusetts is people are now paying the fine because health insurance is so expensive. And you have a pre-existing condition clause, just like Barack Obama. So what's happening in Massachusetts -- the people that Governor Romney has said he wanted to go after, the people that were free-riding, free ridership has gone up fivefold in Massachusetts, five times the rate it was before . . . Five times the rate it's gone up. Why? Because people are ready to pay a cheaper fine and then be able to sign up to insurance, which you're now guaranteed under 'RomneyCare,' than pay high-cost insurance, which is what has happened as a result of 'RomneyCare.'"
Mr. Romney's response was less than persuasive. "First of all, it's not worth getting angry about. Secondly, the -- (laughter, applause) -- secondly, 98 percent of the people have insurance, and -- and so the idea that more people are free-riding the system is simply impossible. Half of those people got insurance on their own. Others got help in buying the insurance.


Floating Bases Enhance Capacity For Quick Strikes
WASHINGTON—Within the president's defense-budget plan is funding for an intriguing new item: a floating drone base that also could be used as a launching pad for commandos.
The vessel—called an "afloat forward staging base"—would be a platform that could be configured to carry and refuel small patrol boats, helicopters or pilotless aircraft.
It would also give the U.S. military the ability to stage a small strike force offshore—without obtaining a permission slip from another country for access to a land base.
Details are still emerging, but the project offers insight into how the Obama administration envisions a military that in some ways is more lethal even as it contracts.
Plans for the specialized vessel fit neatly with the Obama administration's plans to grow special-operations forces, while slimming down conventional forces such as the Army and Marine Corps.


Pesky Question of How Firms Value Exotic Securities
Allegations that several former Credit Suisse Group AG employees misstated bond values revive a thorny question for investors: whether to trust the valuations companies assign their riskiest, most-illiquid assets.
Two former Credit Suisse employees pleaded guilty Wednesday to working to overstate the values of mortgage-backed securities owned by the firm, in an effort to boost their bonuses. A third ex-employee also faces a criminal charge, and all three men plus a fourth face a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging that they fraudulently overstated the prices of $3 billion in subprime bonds.
The case spotlights the valuation questions that have dogged banks and securities firms since the start of the financial crisis. The puzzle of whether financial institutions properly acknowledged losses on their investments wasn't made any simpler when accounting-rule makers, pressured by Congress, in 2009 gave banks and other companies more leeway in valuing less-liquid assets.
The Credit Suisse case comes as a new set of accounting rules that took effect at the start of 2012 will force companies to disclose more about the methods and assumptions they use in valuing exotic securities. The new disclosures wouldn't have prevented the sort of improprieties that allegedly occurred at Credit Suisse, experts say. But they may act as a check on companies, by giving investors a chance to see what assumptions are made in valuation models.
"The fact that they have to report this will make management think," said Ravi Jagannathan, a finance professor at Northwestern University.


Hackers Intercept FBI Call With U.K.
WASHINGTON—The Federal Bureau of Investigation said cybercriminals hacked into a cybercrime conference call between its agents and law enforcement officials overseas.
The 16-minute call was posted on the Internet on Friday. The hacker collective Anonymous claimed responsibility, though the FBI didn't name the group and said a criminal investigation was under way.
Anonymous said it made the call public as part of a series of similar actions against law enforcement around the world. The group is a loose affiliation of hackers and activists with no formal structure or membership.
The breach is an embarrassment for law enforcement, which is wrestling with how to stop cybercrime that crosses borders. One Twitter account that claims to be associated with Anonymous suggested hackers have been monitoring FBI communications for some time.
The call largely consists of FBI agents in the U.S. and Scotland Yard counterparts in Britain discussing developments in investigations.


Brazil's Unsung Nut Gets Some Big Love
Brazil nuts are invariably the outcast of the party bowl, the shunned plus-size cousin in the mix. Despite adding a buttery richness to other snacks—such as chef Yotam Ottolenghi's granola—their oafish appearance keeps many away. However, these edible seeds that grow on giant Bertholletia trees throughout South America (and predominantly in the Bolivian Amazon)—are distinctly flavorful and good for you, too.
According to Sarma Melngailis, the all-things-raw advocate behind Manhattan's Pure Food and Wine restaurant, Brazil nuts are high in selenium, a mineral and antioxidant that has been linked to cancer prevention, mood lifting and immunity support. Selenium is a resource people don't get enough of, and isn't found in many other foods besides garlic.
Chef Yara Castro Roberts, author of "The Brazilian Table," notes that the nut isn't even put to use liberally in the cuisine of its namesake country. One rare example is Moqueca do Norte, a version of a traditional seafood stew in which the requisite coconut milk is replaced by that derived from the Brazil nut. You're more likely to find it in sweet applications, especially in the North region, where the large obloid is a popular foundation for cookies and cakes, or in modern Brazilian dishes, where Ms. Roberts said it can substitute for coconut or macadamias. She recommends grating the nut over a green salad or adding the milk to a shrimp soup made with tapioca.
The Brazil nut can also be blended into pesto, worked into pie crusts, turned into a rack-of-lamb coating or act as a stand-in for almonds in, say, a romesco sauce or white gazpacho.
British baking expert and columnist Dan Lepard said that he finds "the sweet, almost cream-like flavor of Brazil nuts stands well against white chocolate, cream cheese, chocolate and cinnamon." He uses them in brownies, caramel and pound cake.


Edward Luttwak: The President Has Been Given a False Choice on Iran
As the pros and cons of attacking Iran's nuclear installations are debated, Americans are confronted by equally confident but contradictory assertions about the possible scope of Iran's retaliation or the impact on the stability of the regime. Some hope the possession of nuclear weapons will moderate Tehran's fanatics. They argue that's what happened with China under Mao Zedong. Others note that extremism has never been reduced by empowerment.
And so the debate continues inconclusively while Iran's nuclear efforts persist—along with daily threats of death to America, Israel, Britain, Saudi Arabia's rulers, and more.
Yet everyone seems to assume the scope of the attack itself is a fixed parameter—a take-it-or-leave-it proposition that some fear to take and others dread to leave undone. That, by all accounts, is exactly how the issue was framed when the debate started in the last years of the second George W. Bush administration. This is misleading. The magnitude and intensity of an attack is a matter of choice, and it needs to be on the table.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff and their planners offered President Bush only one plan, a full-scale air offensive with all the trimmings—an air war rather than an air strike. While the plan was never publicly disclosed, its magnitude was widely known, and I have learned some of the details. Instead of identifying the few critical nodes of a nuclear-weapon program, the target list included every nuclear-related installation in Iran. And to ensure thorough destruction, each target was accorded multiple aiming points, each one then requiring a weapon of commensurate power, with one or more to follow until bomb-damage assessment photos would show the target obliterated.
That plan elevated the attack to a major operation, with several hundred primary strike sorties and many more support sorties for electronic suppression, refueling, air-sea rescue readiness, and overhead air defense. Given all those aiming points and the longest possible target list, casualties on the ground could run to the thousands.


Language Vote Refuels Latvia Tension
undefined
Latvians go to the polls Saturday to decide whether Russian should join Latvian as an official language of this Baltic nation, in a referendum that is inflaming ethnic tensions more than two decades after the former Soviet republic regained its independence.
Russian speakers, who make up about a third of Latvia's roughly 2 million people, say they often feel like second-class citizens in a country where many ethnic Latvians still harbor deep resentment over their country's absorption by the Soviet Union during World War II.
"We are not just visitors passing through, or strangers, or occupiers," said Vladimir Linderman, head of one of the groups backing the referendum, For the Native Language. "Our goal is to demonstrate our readiness to fully participate in the public life of Latvia, with equal rights."
The pro-Russian measure is almost certain to fail by a wide margin. But campaigning in the run-up to the referendum has fueled a sharp polarization in politics and divided society, leading to sharp debates and souring relations between Russian speakers and other Latvians.


Laying Claim to Michigan, Chrome and All
The Candidate: Mitt Romney
The Play: Getting personal
The Strategy: Mr. Romney is taking pains to remind Michiganders of his upbringing in the state.
In his first Michigan ad, he waxes nostalgic about growing up in the Detroit suburbs during the heyday of the American auto industry. The spot includes black-and-white photos of a much younger Mr. Romney with his wife, Ann, and his dad, George, a three-term Michigan governor.
The Michigan native opened an op-ed in the Detroit News this week by reminding readers, "I am a son of Detroit," before going on to mention his birthplace, Harper Hospital, and reflecting on how he developed a deep affection for cars after his dad became president of American Motors.


EU Court to Examine Antipiracy Pact
BRUSSELS—A new international treaty aimed at clamping down on pirated goods and counterfeiting that has generated protests across Europe will be referred to the European Union's top court to determine whether it clashes with public freedoms.
In a surprise development Wednesday, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would refer the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement to the European Court of Justice for legal guidance on whether it is fully compatible with freedom of expression and freedom of the Internet.
The European Commission and the European Council of member states have already approved ACTA, which has faced prompted demonstration in a number of European capitals, including Berlin and Paris. The European Parliament is set to debate it formally in June. A number of senior parliamentarians have raised concerns about the treaty, and last week, Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding had publicly backed calls by some parliamentarians calling for an ECJ review.
ACTA is an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet. Critics say it endangers freedom of speech and privacy. Wednesday's decision means ratification of the treaty, which took years to negotiate, could be by more than a year. The U.S. is among states from outside the EU that have also signed the agreement.
"We are planning to ask Europe's highest court to assess whether ACTA is incompatible—in any way—with the EU's fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and information or data protection and the right to property in case of intellectual property," EU Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht said Wednesday.


Mandela Released From Hospital
JOHANNESBURG—Former South African President Nelson Mandela was discharged from the hospital Sunday after undergoing a procedure for an undisclosed stomach problem, as officials played down concerns about the 93-year-old antiapartheid activist's health.
Mr. Mandela was admitted to an unidentified hospital Saturday for what the current president's spokesman said was a preplanned admission for a procedure to investigate the causes of a long-standing abdominal issue.
Defense Minister Lindiwe Sisulu told reporters Sunday in Cape Town that the former leader had undergone a laparoscopy, where a fiber-optic camera is inserted through a small incision to view organs in the abdomen, according to the South African Press Association.
South Africa's President Jacob Zuma said late Saturday that Mr. Mandela, the country's first black president, wasn't in any danger and was recovering from the procedure.
"Doctors have decided to send him home as the diagnostic procedure he underwent did not indicate anything seriously wrong with him," the presidency said in a statement.


Notable & Quotable
Political scientist James Q. Wilson in "The Moral Sense" (1993):
Many European thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries hoped that calm, commercial interests would help tame man's unruly and parochial passions. Personal vendettas, dynastic wars, predatory sexuality, and endless duels upset the predictable routines on which large-scale commerce depends. In this view, families obsessed with honor may find it more difficult than those preoccupied with gain to prosper in commercial transactions. Commercial life requires transactions—buying, selling, lending, borrowing—that are made easier by trust and a reputation for trustworthiness. To acquire that useful reputation, fair dealing is necessary, even with people of different clans. Industry progresses with the division of labor, a process that is facilitated by (and in turn reinforces) the view that each person should be judged on merit alone; that is, on the worth of his or her contribution to the collective effort.


Appeals Court Hears Challenge to EPA Rules
WASHINGTON—Judges on a U.S. appeals court appeared skeptical Tuesday of industry challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency's 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, a key determination for Obama administration rules regulating carbon-dioxide emissions.
The EPA finding set the stage for the government's first greenhouse-gas emissions standards on cars, set to begin with the 2012 model year, and new rules on permits for power plants and factories.
The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals is hearing two days of oral arguments on the EPA rules. Industry groups representing chemical, energy, farming and mining companies, as well as Republican lawmakers, are among those challenging the rules. They say the regulations are the most costly, burdensome and precedent-setting regulations the agency has ever issued.
The outcome of the cases could determine whether the EPA can press forward with current and future greenhouse-gas regulations.
During the first day of court hearings, members of a three-judge panel said they were required by law to give deference to the EPA's finding that greenhouse-gas emissions were very likely responsible for most global warming over the last half-century, and were a threat to humans and the environment.


Syrian Rebels Seek Arms
HATAY PROVINCE, Turkey—Syria's rebel military leader appealed for international support a day after his forces ceded their bastion in Homs to government forces when, according to one rebel commander, dissident fighters "ran out of bullets."
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the Syrian government Friday to give humanitarian workers access to the city, amid reports that the Red Cross was being blocked from entering the besieged district of Baba Amr.
"The images which we have seen in Syria are atrocious," said Mr. Ban. "It's totally unacceptable, intolerable. How, as a human being can you bear this situation?"
Activists accused regime forces of carrying out execution-style killings in Homs following the rebel pullback. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights was investigating reports of "a particularly grisly set of summary executions," a spokesman told the Associated Press.
Rebel commanders described their withdrawal from Baba Amr as a strategic concession to thwart a monthlong government bombing campaign that has killed hundreds of civilians.


China Tempers Military Increases
BEIJING—China said on Sunday that it would boost its military spending by 11.2% in 2012, slightly less than last year's increase but still enough to aggravate the concerns that have prompted the U.S. to refocus its defense policy on the Asian-Pacific region.
The slightly slower growth in military expenditure—spending had increased 12.7% in 2011—appeared to be designed to ease worries about China's rapidly expanding arsenal and its increasingly robust diplomacy in the region, while still satisfying Chinese generals eager to continue modernizing the armed forces.
The latest in a series of double-digit rises in military spending was revealed on the eve of an annual meeting of the National People's Congress, or NPC—China's parliament—which is being closely watched this year as it comes a few months before a once-a-decade Communist Party leadership change.
A substantial increase was widely expected, partly because civilian party leaders are eager to ensure the support of the military, an increasingly powerful and vocal political constituency, ahead of the succession in October or November, political analysts say.
The People's Liberation Army has largely forgone a formal role in Chinese politics for the past two decades in exchange for billions of dollars of spending on modern equipment, including a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier, both of which were unveiled last year.


Blasts Rock Republic of Congo
A series of explosions Sunday at an armory within a neighborhood in the Republic of Congo's riverside capital of Brazzaville killed at least 206 people and injured hundreds more as fires swept through homes, churches and businesses.
Brazzaville residents reported thunderous explosions early Sunday, causing many to fear the country was under attack. Minister of Defense Charles Zacharie Boawo appeared on state television to urge calm in Brazzaville and in the neighboring capital of Kinshasa, saying the explosions stemmed from an accidental fire at the weapons depot.
While his statement was sure to bring some measure of relief to a country that has that has seen four coups and a civil war in the 51 years since it won independence from France, people close to the explosions described an "apocalyptic" scene of destruction.
"There have been houses destroyed and deaths, many deaths—a certain number of hundreds of deaths," said Landry Olita, the president's director of programs and events. "Me, myself, I heard the explosions..three huge detonations."
More than 2,000 residents fled the burning and densely populated neighborhood around the depot.


Spain's Move Tests Europe's Mettle on Deficits
It hasn't taken long for the euro zone's new tough budget rules to face their first big test. Spain's stand-off with Brussels over the size of its 2012 budget deficit has presented officials in the city with a dilemma: How do they preserve the credibility of the tighter fiscal rules without triggering a Greece-style downward economic spiral by forcing Spain to slash its deficit too vigorously?
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy formally opened the issue last week when he announced that Spain's new budget-deficit target would not be the 4.4% that his predecessor agreed last year with the European Commission in Brussels—but 5.8%.
The reason: last year's deficit turned out to be 8.5%-not the 6% target that this year's goal was based on. Hitting the agreed 2012 target would cut domestic demand by four percentage points, further squeezing Spain's already shrinking economy.
It wasn't only Mr. Rajoy's unilateral decision that upset the Brussels bureaucracy. It was the way he framed it, telling reporters: "This is a sovereign decision made by Spain that I am announcing now, to you."
Given that he had a short time before signed a new fiscal compact with 24 other European Union governments—the latest of a series of accords that explicitly cede budget sovereignty to Brussels—this undermined the very point of two years of German-inspired efforts to tighten euro-zone budgetary discipline.


Not-Guilty Plea Entered In Cab Stab
STAMFORD, Conn.—A Morgan Stanley executive charged with stabbing a taxi driver and using racial invectives in a dispute over a fare entered a plea of not guilty during a brief court appearance on Friday.
William Bryan Jennings, the firm's co-head of North American fixed-capital markets, left the courthouse immediately after his appearance with his attorney, Eugene Riccio. He is scheduled to return to Stamford Superior Court on April 12.
Mr. Jennings is charged with assault, theft of services and intimidation by bigotry or bias against taxi driver Mohamed Ammar in connection with a dispute three days before Christmas over a fare from New York City to Mr. Jennings's home in Darien.
The two men gave police dramatically different versions of the incident, according to court papers.
Mr. Ammar told police the banker was "drunk" when he picked him up outside a Manhattan hotel and agreed to drive him home. He told police the two had agreed on a fare of $204 when they left New York City, but that when they arrived at Mr. Darien's home, he offered $50. Mr. Ammar said he wanted to call police to report the conflict but had poor cell-phone reception. While he drove around looking for police, Mr. Jennings swore at him, threatened to kill him and said, "You should go back to your own country," the cab driver told police.


New Jersey Indicts 31 in Fraud Scheme
NEWARK—A Newark man and several family members orchestrated an unemployment fraud scheme that raked in $2 million by filing claims using stolen identities, nonexistent work histories and even the names of dead people, authorities said Friday in announcing charges against 31 people.
Named in indictments are 35-year-old Newark resident Terry Dilligard II, whom authorities characterized as the scheme's mastermind, and his mother, father, twin sister and former girlfriend. All five face theft, conspiracy and money-laundering charges that carry maximum prison sentences of five to 20 years.
State Division of Criminal Justice Director Stephen Taylor said the fraud came to light when a debit-card company affiliated with a bank used by the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development noticed some accounts were receiving deposits from multiple claimants or from claimants who were deceased.
A subsequent investigation found a scheme in which the defendants allegedly filed the false claims primarily online, with the payouts going to Internet bank accounts controlled by Mr. Dilligard or by checks to other defendants. Many of the claims falsely asserted the claimants had previously worked at the University of Medicine of New Jersey, Newark Beth Israel Hospital or two private employers.
It wasn't immediately known if any of the defendants had retained attorneys.


South Carolina Official Pleads Guilty to Ethics Violations
COLUMBIA, S.C.—Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Ken Ard has pleaded guilty to seven counts of violating state ethics laws.
The plea Friday afternoon came hours after he resigned from office. He was to be sentenced later Friday.
Attorney General Alan Wilson said Mr. Ard gave $75,000 of his own money to people who then gave that money back to him as individual contributions.
Wilson says Mr. Ard also received $87,500 in contributions that couldn't be matched to the person who allegedly gave them.
The 48-year-old Republican has already paid a $48,000 civil ethics fine for using money from his 2010 campaign to pay for personal items, like clothes, football tickets and a flat-screen TV.


Police Name Shooter in Pittsburgh
PITTSBURGH—A gunman who killed one person and shot several others at a University of Pittsburgh psychiatric clinic before being shot dead by police was identified Friday as 30-year-old John Shick.
Police said Mr. Shick, who is believed to have lived in Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood near the hospital, was armed with two handguns traced to Texas, one of which had been reported stolen.
The gunman shot seven people, including 25-year-old Michael Schaab of Edgewood, who was pronounced dead at the scene, the medical examiner's office said.

'Iron Dome' Hits Short-Range Rockets
Iron Dome is the first missile-defense system capable detecting and destroying short-range missiles within seconds, Israel says.
It was designed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to intercept rockets with ranges of up to 44 miles, those typically used by Israel's declared enemies Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, and Hamas, which rules in Gaza.
Israel relies on three other systems to protect against a range of rockets, the Arrow II system, developed by Boeing Co. with Israel to counter Iran's Shahab-3 missile, which has a range of 800 miles. Raytheon Co. and Israel are also developing the David's Sling system to intercept missiles with ranges of up to 180 miles. Israel also has Patriot missiles for the intermediate range.
The Iron Dome, which has received $205 million in U.S. funding, consists of arrays with about 20 rockets each, a command-and-control center and a radar facility. Each system, which Israeli newspaper Haaretz says costs $50 million, can cover an area the size of a small city.
Within the minute that enemy missiles take to reach their targets, the Iron Dome's radar detects it and then the command and control center determines whether to launch an interceptor missile. That depends on if the missile is headed toward an area that is populated or has critical infrastructure.


King's Video Role Raises Questions
The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating a Monday raid in Brooklyn to see if a video taken of Rep. Peter King during the arrest of a fugitive violates federal policy, a spokesman for the agency said Tuesday.
Mr. King, a Nassau County Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was filmed accompanying marshals as they stormed a walk-up apartment in search of a fugitive.
Parts of one video posted on Mr. King's YouTube account show a man under arrest inside an apartment. The possible violation of federal policy was first reported by Talking Points Memo, a left-leaning news website, after Mr. King linked to it in a message posted on his Twitter account.
"The policy restrictions which prohibit individuals who are not U.S. Marshals employees or Task Force Officers from filming inside a private residence are intended to be in place during all ride-alongs," marshals spokesman Jeff Carter said. "We are currently investigating this matter to determine exactly what happened in this instance."
According to Talking Points Memo, the original video was taken down after reporters asked about it and replaced by an edited one a few hours later.


U.S. Seeks to Extend Base Lease
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan—U.S. defense officials remained hopeful about future access to an air base in Central Asia considered critical to plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, despite renewed calls from the host government of Kyrgyzstan to end the American military presence.
The Kyrgyz public has been wary of outside powers conducting military operations on their territory. In 2009, leaders threatened to push the U.S. out, but relented when the U.S. agreed to raise payments for using the base to $60 million a year from $17 million. U.S. negotiators hope to secure the use of Manas at least through the end of 2014, when the bulk of U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Afghanistan.
Kyrgyz officials privately indicated that they were open to discussing options for the continued use of the transit center at Manas, a senior U.S. defense official said.


CityTime Contractor to Pay City
Science Applications International Corp., the lead contractor on New York City's scandal-tarred CityTime project, has agreed to pay $500 million in a deal that would spare the firm criminal charges in what federal prosecutors called the largest fraud ever committed against the city.
In an agreement released Wednesday, SAIC accepted responsibility for employee involvement in a scheme to siphon millions from the automated payroll project over seven years through a network of shell companies and kickbacks.
"SAIC managers responsible for CityTime placed profit ahead of principle time and time again," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a news conference.
The Virginia-based company won't face prosecution if it avoids criminal activity for three years, according to the agreement. It will also undergo independent monitoring of some policies and practices.
In a statement, SAIC Chief Executive John Jumper said, "We welcome this settlement as an important step in our efforts to move forward as a better, stronger company dedicated to the highest standards of ethics and performance for our customers."


GOP Race Moves to Local Beat in Puerto Rico
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico—As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico has no sway in the general election for president. But some of its pressing issues, such as border control and a coming vote on statehood, are taking a central place in the Republican nominating contest as Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum compete here for votes.
To gin up enthusiasm for a last-minute parade Thursday, Mr. Santorum's supporters relied on a band and free T-shirts.
Lucé Vela, the wife of Gov. Luis Fortuño, warned Ann Romney, Mr. Romney's wife, of what to expect during her visit: "People in Puerto Rico are very enthusiastic about politics, so I think they're getting ready for hugging and kissing."


School Battle Takes a Turn
A state labor board on Tuesday ordered a mediator to intervene in a fight over New York City teacher evaluations that ultimately led Mayor Michael Bloomberg to threaten to close 33 low-performing schools.
The Public Employees Relations Board said the mediator requested by the United Federation of Teachers was necessary because the city hasn't submitted formal plans with the state to close the schools and reopen them with a revamped staff.
A city Department of Education spokesman quickly shot back on Tuesday that although the city hasn't filed paperwork with the state, it still plans to move ahead with the closings. That, officials said, would end the labor fight and eliminate the need for a mediator.
"We strongly disagree with this decision and will take all appropriate legal action to have it reversed," schools spokesman Matt Mittenthal said.
Public hearings are set to begin next week on new schools slated to replace the ones being closed. The mayor moved to close the schools early this year after the union and city couldn't agree on how best to measure the performance of their teachers, dismiss low-rated educators and allow for teachers to appeal.


All Hailing the G's Five
The much-maligned G train is getting an awful lot of lovin' these days.
Defenders of the G, famed for being the city's only subway line that doesn't enter the center of the universe that is Manhattan, are out in full force. Forget that it's only four cars long. Forget that there's no conductor sometimes. Forget that it barely even enters Queens anymore and that you often have to wait as much as eight minutes on a weekday for the green G to chug-a-lug along.
That the G stretches into southern Brooklyn, into the glory land of Park Slope and beyond—well, that alone is reason to cheer for many.
That the five-stop G-line extension that went into effect in 2009 faces an uncertain future—well, that is enough to inspire alarm in the hearts of rabid Brooklynites (and just about every local official, including members of the Working Families Party).
"Preserve the G Train Extension," cry petitions and local blogs.


Glaad's Cousin Vinny
At the enormous, labyrinthine Marriot Marquis Hotel in Midtown on Saturday, bold-faced gay-rights advocates like actor Cheyenne Jackson and news anchor Thomas Roberts walked down a red carpet. Then there was a new activist in the mix: Vinny Guadagnino, the anxiety-addled Lothario of MTV's "Jersey Shore."
"We're a lot smarter than people think," said Mr. Guadagnino of himself and his cast-mates.


Mark Helprin: Obama's Europa Complex
Both in his re-election campaign and as the core principle of his presidency, Barack Obama asks America to cast off reliance on the free market—because, in his characterization, the free market "doesn't work"—in favor of the European model of ever-tightening, ever-regulating, ever-expanding governance. This he does, astonishingly, at the very moment of the European model's long-predictable crisis, collapse, bankruptcy, and devolution.
As a museum of culture, it has few competitors. Europeans make better movies; their cuisine is better (except in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Scandinavia, England, Ireland, the Low Countries, Germany and Switzerland); and they do a better job of suppressing modern architecture, for which they are to be commended.
But in suppressing and over-engineering their economies they court national bankruptcies. Just as reckless are their efforts to ameliorate economic stagnation via the all-guzzling welfare state. Shall we create more jobs by aping Europe, which since 1990 has averaged 9.16% unemployment while ours was 5.95%?
European structural unemployment is supposedly tolerable in the context of less income inequality and greater social analgesia, but although income equality may be the socialist ideal, isn't the more civilized object to provide as abundantly as possible rather than to annihilate the potential for envy? Incomes are perfectly level in the Gulag, whereas in Boston and Singapore they are not.


Quinn Woos Gays, Women
At the top of the Standard Hotel in Manhattan next week, fashion guru Tim Gunn will preside over a gay-friendly fundraiser where other luminaries—Bravo television executive Andy Cohen, Thom Filicia, the interior designer who appeared on "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," and designer Isaac Mizrahi—are also on the guest list.
The glamorous spot and crowd will mark the latest effort by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn to build support among key constituencies—women and the gay community—as she gains momentum for an anticipated mayoral run.
An openly gay Democrat, Ms. Quinn is looking to make history as the city's first woman and lesbian mayor. But as she reaches out to her natural supporters, she has another challenge: carefully maintaining an appeal for more conservative voters, many of whom live outside Manhattan.
In recent years, the 45-year-old Ms. Quinn has moved to the political center, upsetting some of her more liberal base. She has developed a tight alliance with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, siding with him on a number of initiatives, including killing a bill that would have required employers in the city to provide paid sick leave.
In 2009, Ms. Quinn easily won re-election in her district, which includes a swath of the West Side, including Chelsea, Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen. But nearly half the district's Democrats voted to replace her in the primary, a sign that her base of support weakened somewhat as she broadened her vision to the whole city.


New Lawsuit Targets NYPD's Stop and Frisk Policy
In a federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday, local civil rights leaders are accusing the New York Police Department of misusing permission from landlords to patrol inside thousands of private city buildings by conducting stop and frisks that unfairly target blacks and Latinos.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S District Court in Manhattan, is the most recent in a series of accusations that the NYPD is abusing its stop-and-frisk policies.
Brought by 13 current and former city residents, the new suit targets the NYPD practice known as Operation Clean Halls. Under the program, which has been around since 1991, landlords of thousands of low-income buildings, mostly in the Bronx, sign up to allow NYPD officers to roam the halls, corridors and courtyards in an effort to reduce crime.
The suit, which seeks class-action status, is not asking to do away with the program, but for the NYPD to change tactics that it says stand in "stark contrast to the program's professed purpose, which is to combat illegal activity in apartment buildings with high records of crime."
"If you live in one of the thousands of apartment buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls, you are a suspect for no other reason than where you live," said Donna Lieberman, director of New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit along with Bronx Defenders and a Latino civil rights group. She said the officers' actions subject residents to "humiliating, degrading police intrusions."


Raucous Gay-Rights Push in Alaska
ANCHORAGE, Alaska—Alaska is one of 12 states nationwide where neither the state nor any of its municipalities bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. That may change Tuesday—after a rancorous debate—as such a law heads to a vote here in Alaska's largest city.
For the past four months, this city of 292,000 people has been engulfed in a bitter back-and-forth over Proposition 5, which would outlaw discrimination in employment and housing against gay men and lesbians, and also extend protections to people of transgender identity.
While Anchorage's Assembly, as the city council is called, approved such an antidiscrimination ordinance in 2009, Mayor Dan Sullivan vetoed it that same year. That prompted supporters of the measure to take the unusual step of getting Proposition 5 on Tuesday's ballot.
Campaigns for both sides have been saturating Anchorage's airwaves with ads either pushing the measure or slamming it. Opponents say Proposition 5 ultimately could open the door to same-sex marriage statewide. Supporters say they are focused only on the measure in Anchorage and point out the proposal says nothing about gay marriage.
"It's a hornet's nest, and has gotten ugly," said Jim Minnery, chairman of Protect Your Rights, a nonprofit group that is leading the fight against Proposition 5.


A 2013 Contest Revs Up in 2012
Public Advocate Bill de Blasio is likely to vacate his seat and run for mayor in 2013, and sparks are already flying in the race to succeed him.
Council Member Letitia James of Brooklyn criticized Reshma Saujani, a potential rival for the seat, for running a contentious campaign to unseat Rep. Carolyn Maloney in 2010.
Questioning Ms. Saujani's commitment to bolstering the number of women in public office, Ms. James said during an interview: "Congresswoman Maloney has been an advocate for women, and I don't see how running against Congresswoman Maloney advances the cause of women."
While the race for mayor will receive the most public scrutiny, the battle for public advocate, a citywide elected official who serves as a government watchdog and is first in line to succeed the mayor, could be attention-grabbing as well.
Ms. Saujani is contemplating another campaign that would pit her against a female rival. If elected, she would be the first Indian-American woman to win citywide office; Ms. James would be the first African-American.


Campaigns Gird for Battleground States
Though weeks of primary elections still lie ahead, both parties this week began acting as if the fall campaign season already had arrived.
Mitt Romney hasn't clinched the GOP nomination, but with a commanding delegate lead and a win in the Wisconsin primary, he now is concentrating almost solely on President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama engaged Mr. Romney this week, calling him out by name for the first time.
So it is a good time to ask: How will the general election look?
It will be decided state by state, with 270 electoral votes needed to win. The Obama campaign sees several paths to victory. If the president can win every state Sen. John Kerry won in 2004—a common assumption—he needs to add only Florida, or North Carolina and Virginia, or Ohio plus Iowa, or the Rocky Mountain West plus Iowa.
"My goal for the [past] year was to create as many pathways to 270 as possible. All those pathways are still alive and well," said Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager.


Obama Goes on the Attack
The Candidate: Barack Obama
The Play: Going on the attack
The Strategy: Even as Mitt Romney moved from front-runner to likely Republican nominee, President Obama was ready for him, adopting a notably sharper election-year tone this week and launching his first direct attack on Mr. Romney—by name and unprompted—from the presidential podium.
The more partisan Obama made his debut on Monday. He issued a warned the Supreme Court that it would not only be "unprecedented" and "extraordinary" to overturn his health-care law, but it would also be an example of the "judicial activism" Republicans have decried in recent years. "I'm pretty confident that this court will recognize that and not take that step," Mr. Obama said.
The president doubled down on his punchier rhetoric the next day with a blistering speech that sought to pin the most controversial elements of the House Republican budget on Mr. Romney. Speaking at a journalists conference hosted by the Associated Press, Mr. Obama called the GOP budget "a Trojan horse," "thinly veiled social Darwinism" and "an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country." He was jocular and confident, chuckling to himself as he needled Mr. Romney for declaring the budget plan "marvelous."


India's Leader Agrees to Visit Pakistan
NEW DELHI—Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Sunday after meeting Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari that he would make an official visit to Pakistan soon, the latest small gesture between the countries' leaders meant to foster better relations.
Mr. Singh gave no time frame for his visit, which would be his first since coming to power in 2004. New Delhi is likely to want to see Pakistan take concrete steps to clamp down on militant groups that have regularly attacked India, most recently in 2008, before committing to a date.
But Mr. Singh's decision to accept the formal invitation from Mr. Zardari, who himself was on his first trip to India since becoming president four years ago, signals a shift in tone between the nuclear-armed neighbors. It is also the latest in baby steps the nations have been taking to normalize ties after 10 Pakistan gunmen attacked Mumbai in 2008, killing more than 160 people and ending in one blow a four-year effort to build peace.
The crux to a long-standing detente would be a deal over Kashmir, the Himalayan territory divided between Pakistan and India and claimed in its entirety by both.
Both sides realize the issue, which dates to the founding of the nations in 1947, isn't easy to solve. So they have focused instead on less-complex areas like trade and efforts to streamline the issuance of visas to each other's citizens.


Myanmar Meets With Rebels
The search for an end to one of Asia's longest-running guerrilla wars took a step forward when members of the Karen rebel movement met with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday, a day after a rebel delegation met with President Thein Sein.
Ms. Suu Kyi's 21⁄2-hour meeting shows that the new opposition in the country's Parliament considers resolving Myanmar's insurgencies as a key element in rebuilding the country and pulling it out from decades of international isolation.
"These meetings will definitely support our efforts to achieve national reconciliation, and these meetings will help bring about a genuine democratic nation," Ms. Suu Kyi said after Sunday's meeting, the Associated Press reported.
Members of the Karen National Union on Friday strengthened plans for a cease-fire during discussions with government officials, bolstering an agreement the two sides forged in January. Mr. Thein Sein's meeting Saturday with several Karen delegates at the administrative capital Naypyitaw underscored the progress the peace process is beginning to make, and showed how the government views it as a crucial part of the political reforms that the country's military-backed rulers began last year.
In a statement released Sunday, Karen National Union officials said Mr. Thein Sein told them the government would do its best to quickly remove the KNU from a list of outlawed organizations.


Turkey's Shiites Fear Contagion
ANTAKYA, Turkey—As violent clashes continue to boil in Syria and its government is increasingly alienated from neighbors and allies, shopkeeper Ferit Kilic is worried about his own fate over the border in Turkey.
Mr. Kilic is an Alawi, a Turkish offshoot Shiite sect similar to the Alawite sect of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Alawite-dominated government that rules over a Sunni majority. He is one of hundreds of thousands of Arabic-speaking Turkish Alawis, most living near the Syrian border, and fears the sectarian conflict next door could open the same fault lines in Turkey—especially as relations between the two former allies become increasingly hostile.
"For now, we live in harmony with Sunnis here," said Mr. Kilic, as he tallied the cost of sweets a mother was buying for her child. "But in the past there were provocations to get the Sunni and Alawites to fight each other."
Turkey's Arabic-speaking Alawis haven't been silent. In early February, thousands organized two marches here to protest the government's changing attitude toward Damascus, with some openly voicing support for Mr. Assad.
Later that month, more than 20 homes in Turkey's southeast were mysteriously marked by red paint. They all belonged to Alevis, a Turkish and Kurdish-speaking Shiite offshoot who vastly outnumber Arabic-speaking Alawis. Together the two groups constitute an estimated 15 million, or one fifth of a national population of 75 million.


Santorum Exits GOP Contest
GETTYSBURG, Pa.—Rick Santorum suspended his campaign for the White House on Tuesday, clearing the way for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to claim the Republican presidential nomination and end the primary season after three months and 37 contests.
The former Pennsylvania senator told a news conference he had made the decision over the weekend with his family. Trailing far behind Mr. Romney in the delegate count, Mr. Santorum faced a growing chorus of calls from within his party to exit the race and allow Republicans to unify their forces for the November election.
Mr. Santorum's hope of reviving his campaign in the Pennsylvania primary later this month appeared to be fading, raising the prospect of an embarrassing loss in his home state. The health problems facing his 3-year-old daughter, who had been hospitalized over the weekend, also figured into his decision, Mr. Santorum said.
"This presidential race for us is over, for me, and we will suspend our campaign," he said. Suspending a campaign allows a candidate to continue raising and spending money on political activities. Terminating a campaign allows a candidate to raise money only to retire debt.
Mr. Santorum was the last viable challenger to Mr. Romney, who is more than halfway to the 1,144 convention delegates needed to win the nomination. It is unlikely the remaining GOP challengers, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul, can overtake him.


Death Is Best Approached With Advance Care Planning
Diane Coleman and Stephen Drake show no compassion for the pain and suffering of terminally ill patients who would choose suicide over a protracted and anguished death ("'Second Thoughts' Grow on Assisted Suicide," op-ed, April 6). They offer vague warnings about unsubstantiated "coercion and abuse" and ignore the well-documented voter support for Oregon's law. I would argue that by denying terminally ill people recourse to death with dignity via physician prescribed medication, Ms. Coleman and Mr. Drake are inflicting their own brand of coercion and abuse. The concept of a "merciful death" needs to be part of this discussion. It is a sad commentary that our society responds to our pets' terminal suffering more humanely than to our fellow human beings' end-of-life struggles.
Sharon Conrow Comden
Wickenburg, Ariz.
Diane Coleman and Stephen Drake trivialize the patient's right to assume control of his or her life and suffering. End-of-life decisions are not arbitrary or impulsive. Why shouldn't a person choose to end his or her life with dignity if it is obvious that all options for leading any kind of meaningful life are non-existent? I would think any modicum of compassion would respect such a momentous, personal decision. Suffering, physical and mental, and the anguish it causes should produce empathy for the patient's wishes and desires, even if they run counter to our own sense of rectitude.
It is not about us. It's about the patient's right of autonomy. We need to understand that it is ultimately his or her decision to make, not ours.


'I Hate Tax Day—but Not for What You Think'
Everybody hates Tax Day. And so do I. But not for the usual reasons.
This is the time of year when everyone seems to scream about just how much the federal government is costing us all. Weirdly enough, that's not one of the things that really gets me. It's the things that apparently no one else—at least no one else in the media—seems to notice.
Am I crazy? Am I alone? You tell me. Here are some of my Tax Day hates:
Paperwork: Why isn't there a riot about this? According to the National Taxpayers Union, we each waste about 12 hours a year, every year, filling out this crazy stuff.
The instruction booklet for the 1040 now runs to 189 pages; 75 years ago, says the union, it was two pages. The U.S. tax code has tripled in a decade. It now runs to 3.8 million words.


Ex-GSA Chief Apologizes for Conference
The former head of the General Services Administration apologized Monday for letting a lavish conference near Las Vegas happen on her watch and said she shouldn't have paid a bonus to a regional official who organized the event.
Martha Johnson, who resigned as the agency's chief earlier this month, was speaking at a House hearing where lawmakers lined up to denounce the GSA's excesses.
Ms. Johnson said the staff conference in 2010, which according to an inspector general's report cost taxpayers more than $800,000, was nominally a training session but "evolved into a raucous, extravagant, arrogant, self-congratulatory" event.
Regional commissioner Jeffrey Neely organized the event and was summoned to Monday's hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He declined to make a statement or answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), the chairman of the House panel, dismissed Mr. Neely from the hearing, saying that in his dozen years in Congress he couldn't recall any other witness testifying before the panel invoking the Fifth Amendment.


Pitt Tweaks Bomb-Threat Response as Finals Begin
PITTSBURGH—After more than two months of frequent bomb threats, the beleaguered University of Pittsburgh signaled Sunday that it is tweaking its tactics and will no longer automatically evacuate certain buildings when such messages are received.
The shift in tactics is partly aimed at facilitating final exams this week at the campus with nearly 29,000 students in Pittsburgh's bustling Oakland district. The change also suggests that the university, known as Pitt, may be concerned that automatic evacuations could give the person or people responsible for the threats just what they want: the power to disrupt a large campus at will.
Pitt also withdrew an offer of $50,000 for information leading to the conviction of people making the threats. Pitt News, a student newspaper, said it had received emails from a group claiming responsibility for some of the threats. The group told Pitt News it had urged Pitt to ditch the reward offer and would stop making threats now that the university has done so. A Pitt spokesman declined to comment on why the reward offer was withdrawn.
Emailed bomb threats have been arriving almost daily at the university but no explosives have been found after more than 100 searches. On Friday, for instance, some dormitory dwellers were evacuated around 2:30 a.m. Pitt is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law-enforcement agencies. Investigators last week seized a computer server in New York and other computer equipment in Pennsylvania.


Egypt Military Bends to Islamist Will
CAIRO—Egypt's ruling military said it would appoint a new cabinet within 48 hours, awarding a major victory to Islamist politicians and cooling a political confrontation that threatened to gridlock Egypt's emerging democratic institutions.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi's pledge to lawmakers on Sunday came hours after parliament speaker Saad Al Katatni, a senior member of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates the legislature, suspended sessions on Sunday until the military agreed to dissolve the cabinet.
The military's decision to meet that demand could bring an end to a monthslong battle of wills between the popularly elected legislature and the ruling council of generals led by Field Marshal Tantawi, who have defied parliament's demands that it yield executive powers to the country's first post-revolutionary legislature.
But with the military—not the Islamist-dominated parliament—preparing to appoint some new cabinet members, it remained to be seen on Sunday whether the new appointments will mollify Brotherhood leaders by giving them supervisory roles over key ministries or extend an impasse that has unsettled the country's shaky transition.
Amid the tensions, at least one person was killed on Saturday night after unidentified assailants attacked an anti-military march outside the Ministry of Defense, Egyptian state media reported.


GOP Pricks Obama; He Needles Back
WASHINGTON—Republicans stepped up their accusations that President Barack Obama is handpicking issues to divide voters, while the White House over the weekend tried a comic touch amid an increasingly acrimonious political debate.
House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) blamed Mr. Obama for "picking fights" on a range of recent issues, from student-loan interest rates to taxes and gasoline prices. Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) also criticized a new Obama campaign video that recounts the raid that ended in Osama bin Laden's death a year ago.
For his part, Mr. Obama landed several shots, softened with humor, at Saturday's annual dinner for the White House Correspondents' Association.
In remarks in a Washington hotel ballroom, the president began by thanking members of Congress "who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight."
He also poked fun at likely GOP rival Mitt Romney's wealth, adding: "Anyway, it's great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent Hilton ballroom—or what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper."


Obama Takes on Romney in Virginia, Ohio
RICHMOND, Va.—At the first campaign rallies of his re-election campaign, President Barack Obama pressed his case for a second term on Saturday by attacking presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney while insisting: "It's still about hope. ..It's still about change."
The rallies, which came amid fresh anxiety over the economy, marked a new and more aggressive phase in Mr. Obama's increasing transition from president to re-election candidate.
Speaking to crowds in the battleground states of Virginia and Ohio, Mr. Obama repeatedly referred to Mr. Romney as "my opponent" in a new stump speech that sought to turn the former Massachusetts governor's business background against him.
Mr. Romney "has much to be proud of," Mr. Obama told supporters at Virginia Commonwealth University. He said that included Mr. Romney's experience running a state as governor and a major financial firm.
"But I think he's drawn the wrong lessons from these experiences," added the president. "He sincerely believes that if CEOs and wealthy investors like him make money, the rest of us will automatically prosper, as well."


Obama in Cuomo's Glow
ALBANY—When President Barack Obama visited a nanotechnology center here Tuesday, it provided an ideal setting not only for an economic pep talk but also to absorb some of the popularity of his host, Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Mr. Obama, who party officials say has a collegial if not close relationship with his fellow Democrat Mr. Cuomo, enthusiastically embraced the governor before delivering an election-year speech urging Congress to act on his economic agenda.
For Mr. Cuomo, the event offered a widely watched showcase for his message of making government work. For Mr. Obama, who has struggled to break through partisan gridlock in Washington, it was an opportunity to stand with a Democrat who has worked across the aisle and garnered approval ratings in the 70s.
"Now I want what's happening in Albany to happen all across the country," Mr. Obama said in his speech.
For all his popularity, Mr. Cuomo has been a marginal figure in the presidential contest, preferring to tend to business in here in the capital than to stump for Mr. Obama. Few would perceive him as an Obama surrogate the way a neighboring governor, Chris Christie of New Jersey, is seen as an impassioned cheerleader for the presumptive Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.


Annan Raises Fear of Syria Civil War
The Syrian conflict is at risk of breaking into a war that could split the Middle East, the lead international envoy to the country said, presenting his increasingly fragile peace plan as "the only remaining chance" to avert such a fate.
"There is a profound concern that the country could descend into full civil war" that could affect the whole region, joint U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan told reporters Tuesday in his most pessimistic comments yet on the Syrian crisis. "For geopolitical reasons, we should all be concerned."
The comments came after Mr. Annan delivered a long briefing to the U.N. Security Council in New York, his first thorough verbal report on the status of a Syria cease-fire that was to have gone into effect on April 12.
His assessment appeared to be mixed: The presence of observers appears to have had a "calming effect" on the ground and tamped down shelling, he said, even as other kinds of violence have shot up.
"We may well conclude that [the international six-point plan] doesn't work and a different tack has to be taken," Mr. Annan said.


European Officials Pile Pressure on Greece
TALLINN – European officials piled pressure on Greece Saturday to stand by its fiscal commitments or face leaving the euro zone, as political turmoil in the country has cast doubt on whether it will abide by the terms of its latest €130 billion bailout.
"Of course, the ball is now in the Greek court and the hands of the Greek people," the European Union's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said during a debate in Tallinn, Estonia.
Greece faces a "very clear" choice on whether or not to abide by the commitments it has made to its 16 euro-zone peers, Mr. Rehn warned. "It would be much better if Greece finds a way to take the necessary decisions to stay in the euro," he said.
Under the terms of the country's latest €130 billion bailout, Greece must detail some €11.5 billion worth of spending cuts in 2013 and 2014 to close a budget gap expected to reach 7.3% of GDP this year.
However, the country remains in political deadlock following elections Sunday that handed swathes of seats to anti-austerity parties and left mainstream parties without a majority. The left-wing Syriza party, which campaigned against any bailout plan that requires deep spending cuts, saw its support triple and emerged in second place.


Behind the Scenes at Dewey
Once one of New York's biggest law firms, Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP is on the brink of collapse following partner defections, disappointing revenue and a compensation scheme that awarded nearly one-third of the partnership with pay guarantees at the expense of rank-and-file partners.
Partner exits have been accelerating over the past month, and many employees have been told that their last day will be sometime this week. The law firm also faces an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office, which has declined to comment on the scope or nature of the probe.
The plan now: to liquidate the law firm without going through a formal bankruptcy process. That approach, if it works, could save money and provide a better chance of collecting unpaid bills from clients to pay off the more than $225 million that Dewey owes to creditors, according to the firm's current leadership.
The situation marks a dismal turn for Dewey & LeBoeuf, which was created in 2007 from the merger of two old-line law firms whose roots stretch back to the early 20th century: Dewey Ballantine LLP, for years run by Thomas E. Dewey, a former New York governor and presidential candidate, and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacCrae LLP.
Bankruptcy specialist Martin Bienenstock in New York and Charles Landgraf, the head of the firm's legislative and public policy group in Washington, are members of the four-partner office of the chairman, which was created in March as Dewey's troubles deepened. In an interview on Saturday, they described why the firm is unable to survive and how they have been working with lenders in recent weeks.


Ethics Panel Comes Under a Spotlight
ALBANY—A state ethics body has asked a high-ranking Senate Republican to respond to ethics allegations stemming from a Yonkers corruption case.
Sen. Thomas Libous, a veteran lawmaker from Binghamton, said Tuesday that the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a new watchdog set up by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers, had formally notified him of a potential ethics inquiry.
The commission's actions, first reported by the Albany Times-Union, were supposed to stay confidential. The disclosure puts the commission and Mr. Libous under a politically charged spotlight. The ethics body now faces far more public scrutiny as it decides whether the senator should face a full investigation.
It's the first major case since Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers last year overhauled state ethics laws, creating a commission with oversight over the Legislature.
Mr. Cuomo hailed the commission as a crucial breakthrough for ethics enforcement in a scandal-plagued statehouse.


Domestic-Violence Act Passes the House
The House voted largely along party lines Wednesday to approve a five-year reauthorization of a domestic-violence law, setting up a showdown with the Senate, this time over social rather than fiscal policy.
Most Democrats voted against the House version of the Violence Against Women Act because of how it deals with victims of domestic violence in the Native American, gay and illegal-immigrant communities. For example, the House bill doesn't include language about gay victims of domestic assault, which the Senate bill does.
The law, enacted in 1994, has routinely been renewed by unanimous consent. But in an election year in which both parties appear eager to pick fights over every aspect of federal policy, it has become embroiled in the wider political battle.
The House voted 222-205 for the measure, which carries the same $3.3 billion cost over five years as the Senate bill. More than 20 Republicans voted against the bill, while about half a dozen Democrats joined the majority in voting in favor of it.
A House-Senate conference committee will meet in June to try to work out a compromise.


Gourmand's Grape Juice
I HAVE A BIT of a love/hate relationship with the grape. I adore a good glass of wine, but my heart sinks whenever I walk into a bar that serves wine cocktails. I can't help but feel that I'm going to end up with a poor imitation of a "real" drink. But when I spot a cocktail featuring verjus, I think: Now we're talking.
Verjus, also known as verjuice, is non-fermented, non-alcoholic sour juice made from unripened grapes pruned from vines in preparation for the wine harvest. The trick is to pick these grapes when they are high in acid and low in sugar. "That balance between the acid and sugar is critical," said Rudy Marchesi, winemaker and proprietor of Oregon's Montinore Estates, which produces verjus. "If you pick them too soon, it's too acidic. Too late, and it's too sweet." Good verjus finds a happy medium somewhere between sweet grape juice, wine and vinegar.
Verjus, like wine, comes in red and white varieties. Its flavor profile is all over the map, with notes ranging from chamomile to citrus to stone fruit. Reds can be smooth or robust, fruity to floral; while whites can be light or loud, tangy to sharp. Unlike wine, it keeps nicely when corked and refrigerated for up to 3 months.
While too acidic to drink straight, the addition of soda or seltzer makes it a punchy, non-alcoholic spritzer, a traditional favorite of pregnant French women. For me, verjus especially shines in a boozy cocktail. It brings a complex counterpoint to any drink, mixing well with the bite of gin, the vegetable essence of tequila, the sugar of liqueurs or the depth of Scotch. These three cocktails showcase the best of verjus's bittersweet-and-sour glory.


NATO Leaders Seal Afghan Exit Plan
CHICAGO—North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders on Monday signed off on a plan to give Afghan forces the lead in combat operations next year, setting the stage for winding down the war in 2014, as President Barack Obama suggested progress in ending an impasse to reopen supply routes through Pakistan.
The drawdown over the next 21⁄2 years from landlocked Afghanistan will be a massive logistical undertaking, underscoring the importance the U.S. and NATO have placed on quickly reaching a deal with Pakistan to reopen cargo routes.
Mr. Obama on Monday said the U.S. has made headway in tense negotiations with Pakistan over the reopening of the vital supply routes, inching toward the end of an impasse that complicated a strategy for ending the decadelong war.
Mr. Obama spoke briefly with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in an unscheduled meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit to underline the importance of ending the dispute.
Pakistani officials said their negotiating team had been asked to speed up the talks—but could not predict when they would be concluded.


U.S. Drone Strike Kills al Qaeda No. 2
WASHINGTON—The militant considered to be the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
Abu Yahya al-Libi was seen as al Qaeda's most versatile leader, and his death on Monday was the latest setback for a group that U.S. officials say is reeling from recent losses.
The operation that killed Mr. Libi also showed the U.S. has maintained its intelligence capacity in Pakistan amid tension with the Pakistani government and despite enhanced security measures that al Qaeda has taken in the wake of the raid that killed its leader, Osama bin Laden, a year ago.
The attack was the latest in a rapid succession of Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes in recent weeks, after attacks slowed in the wake of the accidental killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers by U.S. helicopters at a post at the Afghan border in November. There have been 22 strikes reported so far this year, according to the New America Foundation, which tracks them.
U.S. officials declined to give details of how Mr. Libi's death was confirmed. American officials generally require physical evidence such as a DNA sample to confirm a target's identity.


No Criminal Charges in Fatal Christmas Fire
No criminal charges will be filed in a Christmas house fire in Stamford that killed three girls and their grandparents, a Connecticut prosecutor said Friday.
State's Attorney David Cohen of Stamford said that the girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and her friend, Michael Borcina, took some precautions to prevent a fire, and while the moves proved insufficient, they didn't rise to the level of criminal negligence.
He said Mr. Borcina smoothed out the ashes in a bag with his hand to assure Ms. Badger that no live embers were present before discarding them in a bin in the home's mudroom.
The blaze killed Ms. Badger's three daughters—7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger and 9-year-old Lily Badger—and Ms. Badger's parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson. Ms. Badger and Mr. Borcina escaped the fire.
"When such a horrific event occurs, it is only natural that those related to the victims and the public in general want to hold someone responsible for what is otherwise an inexplicable accident," Mr. Cohen wrote in a statement.


Five Officers Arrested for Rikers Attacks
Five New York City correction officers have been arrested on assault and other charges after an investigation found that their written justifications for using force against Rikers Island inmates didn't match surveillance video, authorities said Thursday.
The city Department of Investigation said the arrests occurred over the past three months as part of a larger probe scrutinizing the accounts officers give for violent altercations with inmates.
In the most recent arrest on Thursday, Daniel DiPierri, previously a captain in the city Department of Correction, was charged with assault, official misconduct and falsifying business records for an incident on Jan. 7 at the George R. Vierno Center, an 850-bed, maximum security correctional facility for men on Rikers Island.
Video surveillance showed Mr. DiPierri grabbing, kicking and striking an inmate who didn't retaliate, the New York City Department of Investigation said. Mr. DiPierri then submitted a false report saying the inmate had swung at him with a clenched fist, officials said.
Mr. DiPierri, 35 years old, of Seaford, N.Y., declined to comment Thursday, as did his attorney. He was demoted from probationary captain to correction officer earlier this month and was suspended Thursday.


Greek Parties Vie for an Uphill Task
ATHENS—Whichever party wins Greece's national parliamentary election on Sunday will face an uphill task: inheriting a central government nearly out of cash, an economy in free fall and a restive public tired of austerity measures.
Greece's conservative leader Antonis Samaras, in his final rally before national elections on Sunday, said the euro currency represented an "anchor" of stability for the country and warned that Greece's recession-ravaged economy couldn't withstand the shock of further political uncertainty.
"The fate of the country will be decided by the answers the people give to seven crucial dilemmas," Mr. Samaras told several thousand supporters in a main square of the Greek capital. "The first of those that will be decided the day after tomorrow is the dilemma of the euro or the drachma."
Sunday's elections are being seen as a de facto referendum on Greece's future with the euro, pitting Mr. Samaras's New Democracy party—which mostly supports the country's latest European-led bailout—against their leftist rival, Syriza, which has denounced the deal and wants to tear up the austerity program that came with it.
The rivals are poised to become the two largest parties in Greece's 300-member Parliament, but whoever finishes first will gain a 50-seat bonus and significant advantage in forming a government.


Western Allies Seek New Path on Syria
BEIRUT—The head of the United Nations mission in Syria said a surge in attacks by both sides in the conflict was impeding the work of its monitors there, as the government's use of attack helicopters spurred new talk of other options to stop the bloodshed.
With the U.N. mission unraveling and a diplomatic deal appearing unlikely, U.S. and European officials discussed possible next steps with Syrian opposition groups on the sidelines of a two-day conference in Istanbul that ends Saturday, people involved in the talks said.
Opposition leaders said they were pushing for avenues of intervention that would bypass the U.N. Security Council, where Russian and Chinese vetoes would be likely to block a mandate to take action against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Options pursued by the opposition include the establishment of a long-discussed protected zone along Turkey's border for refugees fleeing violence, according to a diplomat in the region. A so-called safe zone could also serve as a training ground and launchpad for opposition fighters
Discussions of a safe zone have been revived in the wake of mass killings and the first documented sustained use of helicopter gunships by the Syrian government. U.N. monitors observed helicopters firing in the western province of Latakia, and over the towns of al-Rastan and Talbiseh in Homs, said Sausan Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria.


New York As Literary Magnet
Novelist Joshua Henkin is a born-and-bred Manhattanite, as are many of his characters. But like Mr. Henkin, they have a complicated relationship with the city.
In his new novel, "The World Without You" (Pantheon), three sisters who grew up on the Upper West Side meet their parents in the Berkshires to commemorate the death of their brother, a journalist who was killed in Iraq. Two of the sisters have moved away and are reluctant to return, and their mother had to be convinced to even leave Manhattan for the Berkshires in the first place. Yet by the book's end, all head back toward the city.
Mr. Henkin, who directs the MFA program in fiction writing at Brooklyn College, grew up in Morningside Heights and has lived in Park Slope since 1999. He spoke with the Journal recently about creating characters who live in his hometown.
After growing up here, you moved around the country for a while—Cambridge, Berkeley, Ann Arbor. Similarly, your characters come from New York, then seem to leave, but are lured back.


Yacht Hoax Leads Examined
The Coast Guard is investigating whether a phony distress call off New Jersey last week is linked to a similar Mayday hoax last month off the coast of Texas.
A distress call on May 20 near Galveston, Texas, shares several similarities with the June 11 call claiming an explosion had sunk a yacht named Blind Date near Sandy Hook, N.J., Coast Guard Capt. Gregory Hitchen said at a news conference Wednesday morning.
Both calls also used the word "souls" to describe the people on board, "beacon" to describe a supposed automatic-signaling device on life rafts used by passengers and the phrase "taking on water."
Capt. Hitchen, deputy commander of Coast Guard Sector New York, said both calls appeared to originate from land. In the Sandy Hook case, direction-finding equipment pointed to an area from the north shore of Staten Island, over New Jersey to near the George Washington Bridge.
The two calls were also made to one of the Coast Guard's vessel-traffic centers rather than the search-and-rescue center, where the majority of distress calls are received.


Florida Law on Cuba Heads to Court
MIAMI—Florida Gov. Rick Scott has strived to foster a business-friendly environment in this state and has courted international companies in overseas trade missions. But a measure he signed into law in May that targets foreign firms with business ties to Cuba threatens to complicate those efforts.
The law, scheduled to take effect July 1, bars the state and local governments from hiring such firms for contracts worth at least $1 million. The measure, which would apply only to future contracts, is worded so that even if a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign company has no direct business with Cuba, it would still fall under the law's scope if another subsidiary of the parent company does work on the island.
The law has put Mr. Scott, a Republican, in a bind—caught between Florida's Cuban exile community, with its deep-seated anti-Castro sentiment, and the state's business interests, which have typically found a friendly audience in the governor.
Whether the measure is implemented as scheduled is now the subject of litigation. Earlier this month, Odebrecht USA—a Coral Gables, Fla., subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA—filed a lawsuit against the state in U.S. District Court in Miami, arguing the law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the federal government's authority to make foreign policy. On Monday, a federal judge is scheduled to hear arguments on the contractor's motion for a preliminary injunction.
Odebrecht, which has handled numerous high-profile construction jobs in Miami, including a performing arts center, was selected for a project to create a new hotel and shopping complex at the Miami airport. Yet another subsidiary of the parent company is upgrading the Port of Mariel in Cuba. As a result, the new law could force Odebrecht off the airport project.


Madoff's Brother to Plead Guilty
Bernard Madoff's younger brother, Peter, is expected to plead guilty to criminal charges and has agreed to go to prison for 10 years, in the first admission of wrongdoing by a family member in a multibillion-dollar investment business that turned out to be "just one big lie."
Part of the challenge for prosecutors, as in any fraud case, has been to find evidence of criminal intent. The expected guilty plea suggests that prosecutors are focusing on conduct that facilitated the fraud, even if the individual themselves didn't know the full extent of what was happening at the firm.
Peter Madoff, 66 years old, is expected to plead guilty to two charges at a hearing Friday in Manhattan federal court, including falsifying the records of an investment adviser and a broad conspiracy count to commit securities fraud and other crimes, according to a letter sent to U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain and filed in court on Wednesday.


Ruling Favors Church
Religious institutions will be able to hold services in city school buildings under a ruling Friday by a federal judge.
The decision, which the city vowed to appeal, was the latest twist in legal battle dating to 1995, when a Bronx church sued for the right to worship in a school after city officials rejected its application.
Religious leaders praised the ruling as a victory for religious freedom.
"We are very pleased with the decision," said Robert Hall, co-pastor of the Bronx Household of Faith, which brought the suit. But he added: "It's not the end."
City officials agreed, condemning a decision that, they argued, forces the government to subsidize religious worship at taxpayer expense.
"We are very disappointed," said Jonathan Pines, the deputy chief of the city's General Litigation Division, in a statement.
The decision reversed a June 2011 appeals court ruling that upheld the city ban.
In February, the church refiled its case, emphasizing different arguments, and won a temporary injunction. On Friday, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York made the injunction permanent, pending an appeal.
"We've had this resurrection from the dead here," said plaintiff's attorney Jordan Lorence. "This case has just got so many twists and turns like a Russian novel almost."
In the meantime, more than 50 religious institutions throughout the city will continue to rent after-hours space in city schools for worship services.
Without discounted rates, many say they would struggle to afford spaces large enough for their congregations.
Mr. Hall estimated monthly rents at P.S. 15 in the northwest Bronx to be $550 to $600—compared to around $3,000 at a commercial property.

Political Defectors Stir Activist Debate
BEIRUT—Two prominent Syrian political defections within a week have stirred a debate within the opposition movement over what role—if any—former officials can play in ousting the Assad regime and serving in any transition government.
Meanwhile, activists reported new massacres late Thursday in Syria's central Hama province, saying regime forces killed more than 100 people. The reports, by the umbrella activist group Local Coordination Committees and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, couldn't be confirmed.
The defection this week of Syria's ambassador to Iraq and last week of a top military commander and friend to President Bashar al-Assad was hailed by Western officials as a sign the Assad regime has begun to crumble. "We do see the pressure building," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday. "Senior military figures from the Syrian army are defecting every week."
But Syrian activists view the developments cautiously, raising questions on whether longtime Assad allies can be committed to the opposition, if some of them are regime puppets or whether they are acting opportunistically before the Assad regime falls.
The defections come as Mr. Assad recently recommended to Syria special envoy Kofi Annan that a government minister, Ali Haidar, serve as an interlocutor on a political transition process, said Ahmad Fawzi, Mr. Annan's spokesman. The proposal poses a dilemma for the opposition, which has refused to talk with government officials, but don't want to appear obstructionist.


GOP Super PAC Comes to Romney's Defense
In the exchange of attack ads that is defining the presidential race, Mitt Romney has been hindered by a feature of campaign-finance law. While Mr. Romney is outraising President Barack Obama, much of his money can't be used until he formally becomes the GOP nominee.
Now, one of Mr. Romney's allies in the super PAC world plans to give some direct help. American Crossroads, a GOP-aligned political action committee, will begin an $8.8 million ad buy in nine states on Thursday to defend Mr. Romney from Democratic charges that he helped ship U.S. jobs overseas, said the PAC's president, Steven Law.
The Crossroads ad marks a departure for it and most other outside political groups. Until now, they have spent most of their money on such themes as criticizing Mr. Obama for the rising federal deficit. But the new ad is the first from Crossroads to mention Mr. Romney explicitly, and in defending him it serves a role that candidates traditionally have filled themselves.
The new spot comes as some Republicans acknowledge that Mr. Obama's attack on Mr. Romney's career as a private-equity investor, now in its fourth week, has left the Republican candidate on the defensive and made it hard for him to advance his own message. Mr. Obama's accusations revolve around the idea that Mr. Romney, through his investments, aided companies that outsourced U.S. jobs to other countries, which the Romney campaign has vigorously denied.
"There are periods of time when you can tell the momentum is clearly with you. You can tell there are other times the message momentum is clearly with the other side," said Henry Barbour, a Romney fundraiser and Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi. "In the last week or two the momentum has shifted more towards Obama's attacks."


Blaze on Newark Block Kills 5
NEWARK—Five people, including three children, died early Friday in a three-alarm blaze that started in a vacant building and spread to nearby homes, according to fire officials.
The victims of the fire in the city's West Ward were a 3-year-old girl, a 5-year-old boy, another young child, a teenager and an adult, said Newark Fire Capt. John Brown.
The victims hadn't been identified as of Friday afternoon, said Katherine Carter, spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating along with the city arson squad.
The blaze on Brookdale Avenue was first called in to the Fire Department at 1:41 a.m., Capt. Brown said.
Firefighters were met by intense flames shooting out the windows of the building—a vacant multifamily house—and saw that the fire had spread next door to the second and third floors of a building that housed five families.


University of Colorado Plans Security Sweep
AURORA, Colo.—The University of Colorado will make a security sweep of its educational campus here to check for traps that might have been laid by shooting suspect James Holmes, a spokeswoman for the university said Saturday.
An initial security check on Friday of the laboratories in the neuroscience department, where Mr. Holmes had been a student until voluntarily dropping out in mid-June, turned up nothing, said the spokeswoman, Jacque Montgomery. The new examination will cover the Anschutz Medical Campus, on the site of the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Garrison, but not the University's two hospitals there, Ms. Montgomery said.
"The sweep was just an extra level of assurance" for students and faculty, Ms. Montgomery said, in the wake of the movie-theater shooting that left 12 dead and 58 injured.
The university is also assisting students who lived in the same apartment building as Mr. Holmes to find new housing, Ms. Montgomery said. The three-story red brick building remains cordoned off by police who are attempting to neutralize a web of booby traps found in top-floor rooms.
Aurora police and emergency workers regrouped outside of the building early Saturday as they mulled the best course of action to defuse the traps. But they said it is unlikely that they will have to take steps as dramatic as burning or blowing up the building.


U.S. Mounts Effort to Weaken Assad's Rule
The U.S. has been mounting a secret but limited effort to speed the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad without using force, scrambling spies and diplomats to block arms and oil shipments from Iran and passing intelligence to front-line allies.
A centerpiece of the effort this year focused on getting Iraq to close its airspace to Iran-to-Syria flights that U.S. intelligence concluded were carrying arms for Assad loyalists—contrary to flight manifests saying they held cut flowers. The U.S. has also tried to keep ships believed to carry arms and fuel for Syria from traversing the Suez Canal, with mixed results.
The behind-the-scenes efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency, the State and Treasury departments and the military point to a broader American role in the campaign against Mr. Assad than previously acknowledged. The efforts have ramped up recently as relations with some in the Syrian opposition have warmed and as Mr. Assad has grown more desperate for supplies.
Skeptics within the Obama administration and on Capitol Hill, however, say U.S. pressure is hit-or-miss and comes too late to ensure U.S. influence over any post-Assad future. Many Syrian opposition leaders complain the U.S. hasn't done enough and say the efforts of regional allies such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, in some cases to ship arms, are more significant.
U.S. officials acknowledge the limitations that come from the Obama administration's unwillingness to get entangled in the conflict. While some weapons flights to Syria have been stopped, officials say intelligence is hard to obtain and overseas governments can be balky about cooperation. Some shipments of arms and fuel for Syria have slipped through.


Clashes Intensify in Syria's Aleppo
The Syrian regime restored some measure of normalcy to most areas of Damascus after a week of heavy clashes with rebels in the capital, even as fighting reached the gates of the ancient quarter of Aleppo, the country's most populous city.
Opponents of President Bashar al-Assad battled regime forces for the fourth day in Aleppo, a northern commercial hub and the last big holdout, along with Damascus, from the violence that has consumed much of the country after 18 months of conflict. Government forces used low-flying helicopter gunships to fire at rebels, said an opposition activist in Aleppo, who said rebels had gained control of the Salahuddin neighborhood in the city's southwest.
"The FSA is on the streets like ants," the activist said, referring to the fighters from the Free Syrian Army of military defectors and local fighters.
That contrasted with the relative calm that settled over Damascus after more than a week of battles in several neighborhoods and a bombing that killed four senior figures of President Assad's regime.
Some shops in the city center reopened for the first time in days. Traffic appeared in many parts of the city. Damascenes rushed to buy bread and water and purchase airtime for mobile telephones. By nightfall, streets were empty. Taxi drivers turned down rides. Checkpoints of pro-regime forces were seen on every other street.


U.S. Sets Sights on al Qaeda in Mali
The U.S. is considering new steps to counter an emerging haven for al Qaeda militants in Mali, officials said, ranging from working more with local forces to more direct intervention should the U.S. be threatened.
American and European counterterrorism officials have watched with alarm in recent months as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, established a significant presence in the north of Mali, in western Africa. The extremists have taken advantage of a power vacuum left by a military coup in the capital earlier this year.
Michael Sheehan, assistant U.S. defense secretary for special operations, said Thursday at the Aspen Institute security forum that the U.S. "can't allow al Qaeda to sit in ungoverned space" in the north of Mali.
Mr. Sheehan said a "whole range of things" were under consideration by U.S. and allied officials, including "perhaps operating in ungoverned space." Mr. Sheehan wouldn't elaborate on what types of operations might be on the table.
The U.S. military uses armed drones and special forces to target al Qaeda leaders and supporters in Yemen and Somalia that are seen as posing a threat to the U.S. But in many countries in the region, the focus of U.S. special forces is limited to training local allies to fight al Qaeda and other militants.


New York's Tea-Party Rematch
SYRACUSE, N.Y.—Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle narrowly won her seat in 2010 with the aid of people like Joanne Wilder, a tea-party activist who helped organize a feisty campaign against the Democratic incumbent.
This year, Ms. Wilder, a coordinator for the Central New York Patriots, said she doesn't feel the same level of enthusiasm in this district stretching across Syracuse and the surrounding area. "2010 was a different year," said the retired resident of Cicero, a Syracuse suburb. "It's like [tea-party activism] has all gone back to sleep."
In an election that will help decide control of the House of Representatives, the outcome will depend largely on whether tea-party supporters turn out again for Ms. Buerkle, a conservative Republican in a redrawn district that favors Democrats.
Ms. Buerkle's challenger is the same man she beat by 567 votes in 2010, Dan Maffei, a former aide to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rep. Charles Rangel who served one term as congressman.
Both national parties are carefully watching a rematch that will be more tightly focused on the economy than in 2010, when Mr. Maffei's vote for President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul dominated the debate. Ms. Buerkle and dozens of other GOP freshmen are trying to prove their tea party-fueled victories weren't a fluke.


Charges Weighed in Kidnap
Charges were not filed against a New York City police detective in the kidnapping of a 25-year-old man after one of four suspects arrested in the case told investigators the 17-year veteran played no role in the crime, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the case said on Sunday.
Det. Ondre Johnson was suspended without pay while NYPD internal-affairs investigators determine whether he played any role in the kidnapping of Brian Karikari, who was found bound and gagged in the garage of the detective's Queens home, the official said.
Det. Johnson, who is assigned to the Brooklyn North gang-investigation unit, was suspended without pay because he owns the house and "found himself running with a questionable crowd," the official said. Hakeem Clark, a suspect charged in the kidnapping, is the detective's cousin and shares a two-floor apartment with the detective, the official said.
After obtaining a search warrant, officers also found counterfeiting paraphernalia in the basement of the home, the official said.
Det. Johnson could not be reached for comment on Sunday. It was unclear what he told investigators about the kidnapping or the counterfeiting materials.


Schools Commissioner Is Confirmed for N.J.
TRENTON—The leader of New Jersey's Education Department has been confirmed 18 months after he was nominated for the job by Gov. Chris Christie.
The state Senate confirmed Christopher Cerf by a 28-0 vote Monday.
Mr. Cerf began serving as acting commissioner in December 2010.
Mr. Cerf's confirmation was held up for 18 months because of a process called senatorial courtesy, which allows the senator from the nominee's home county to block a gubernatorial appointment.
Mr. Cerf, who lives in Montclair, rented an apartment in Republican-friendly Montgomery to get around the rule after Sen. Ron Rice, an Essex County Democrat, refused to sign off on his nomination.


Democrats Back Gay Marriage Platform
Democrats drafting their party's platform have unanimously approved including an endorsement of same-sex marriage, Democratic aides and gay activists say, putting the policy stance on track to be part of a major-party platform for the first time.
The party is betting such a move could energize the base without turning off independents. But it could complicate the message of swing-state Democratic candidates and those vying for the votes of African Americans, who oppose gay marriage in greater percentages than much of the population.
The question of whether to include the measure has been intensely debated. But the recent backing of same-sex marriage by President Barack Obama cleared the path for the decision.
The platform isn't yet final, but the unanimous approval Sunday by a 15-member drafting committee makes the plank's inclusion likely. The recommendation was earlier reported by the Washington Blade.
The full platform committee meets Aug. 10-12 in Detroit, where it will consider the draft platform. The document will then be forwarded for approval by delegates to the party's national convention, to be held in September in Charlotte, N.C.


Israeli Leader Challenges U.S. on Iran
ASHKELON, Israel—Israeli leaders dismissed the chances that a U.S.-led sanctions campaign will convince Iran to give up its nuclear program, in a direct challenge to the Obama administration's strategy, which has focused on diplomacy and sanctions rather than the threat of military action.
"Right now the Iranian regime believes that the international community does not have the will to stop its nuclear program," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Jerusalem on Wednesday, with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta by his side. "This must change, and it must change quickly because time to resolve this issue peacefully is running out."
Mr. Netanyahu said Iran didn't appear to believe U.S. statements that all options were on the table.
"You yourself said a few months ago that when all else fails, America will act," he said to Mr. Panetta. "But these declarations have also not yet convinced the Iranians to stop their program."
Mr. Panetta, after greeting the prime minister warmly, appeared to have been taken aback by his sharp criticism of the U.S. The defense secretary, in his public remarks, took a more hawkish tone toward Iran, in an effort to ease Israeli concerns.


Clinton, Turkish Official Discuss Syria
ISTANBUL—U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the Syrian crisis with her Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu in Istanbul on Saturday, amid a worsening conflict between regime and opposition forces inside Syria.
Mrs. Clinton's visit was seen in Turkey as a reaffirmation of U.S. support for Turkey's policy on Syria. Turkey has fiercely criticized the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and is hosting Syrian opposition groups, which are actively working to overthrow the regime, especially along the long border between the two countries.
Mrs. Clinton said in a joint press conference in Istanbul that the two countries' foreign ministries were coordinating closely on Syria to support the opposition—in ways which said she did not want to describe in detail—as well as to aid democratic transition in Syria and end the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict.
Mrs. Clinton said that the two allies are seeking to speed up the transition of power in Syria in a more concrete way.
"Our intelligence services, our military have very important responsibilities and roles to play, so we are going to be setting up a working group to do exactly that," she said.


Romney Pick Puts Medicare in Bull's-Eye
In selecting Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney has also made the fight over the future of Medicare a focal point of the election, raising opportunities and challenges for both parties, particularly in battleground states such as Florida.
Many Democrats and liberal groups said immediately that they'd use the sweeping plan to overhaul Medicare authored by Mr. Ryan as a cudgel against Republicans in the presidential race, as well as in down-ballot elections.
Democrats have had mixed results using Mr. Ryan's Medicare plan on the campaign trail in recent House races. Now, a central question of the presidential election will be how the public reacts to the Ryan Medicare plan, which is similar to ideas Mr. Romney himself has put forward.
Now Mr. Romney will have to decide quickly whether to fully embrace Mr. Ryan's proposal or offer a distinct variation before his opponents have an opportunity to shape the debate.
Mr. Ryan has staunchly defended his plan for more than a year, refining his argument for it, and he isn't likely to buckle now that the debate is again taking the national stage.


The Giants' Pass Rush: Better Than Ever?
Injuries left the New York Giants saddled with a patchwork secondary in 2011 and they didn't really find a starting middle linebacker until veteran Chase Blackburn was re-signed in Week 13. So it's really no wonder why New York ranked 19th in run defense and 29th in pass defense during the regular season.
But if there was one thing that kept the Giants defense afloat until the personnel came together for their Super Bowl run, it was the pass rush—the crown jewel of defensive coordinator Perry Fewell's attack.
New York finished the regular season tied for third in sacks thanks to the emergence of Jason Pierre-Paul (16.5 sacks) and the continued excellence of Osi Umenyiora (nine sacks in nine games).
Things aren't much different at the start of the 2012 season.
Blackburn is battling second-year linebacker Mark Herzlich for the starting job at middle linebacker and cornerback Terrell Thomas has aggravated his surgically repaired anterior cruciate ligament, which means Fewell is already shuffling around the secondary. But if there's one positive Giants fans can take from training camp—and it's a terrifying proposition for opponents—it's that this pass rush can be better in 2012.


Finland Confirms Euro-Exit Scenarios
HELSINKI—Finland has contingency plans for a possible breakup of the euro, Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said Friday in a rare disclosure from a euro-zone official about the extent of concern over that prospect.
Finland's European affairs minister Alexander Stubb quickly clarified Mr. Tuomioja's remarks, saying that "every government has various scenarios that they are working with. Our No. 1 scenario is that the euro zone will regain stability and we are working in a constructive way to achieve that goal."
Some euro-zone governments and European Union officials have this year acknowledged that they are assessing how to react if Greece were to exit the currency zone or similar events transpired. Mr. Tuomioja went further, saying that Finland has estimated the cost of a breakup.
"I would assume that every government would be assessing this, since this has been openly discussed," Mr. Tuomioja said in an interview. "Every finance ministry would want to assess the alternatives." He gave no evidence that they are doing so.
Finance officials in other European capitals didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.


Gov. Christie's Senate Fight
Gov. Chris Christie has traveled the country stumping for presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, but a race closer to home is personal.
On one side is his close friend, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, whom the governor introduced to his future wife. The two rose through the Republican Party ranks together.
On the other is one of the governor's most powerful political opponents, Sen. Robert Menendez, whom Mr. Christie launched an investigation against in 2006 while serving as U.S. Attorney in Newark.
Mr. Menendez is considered a favorite in the race, even with a popular governor lending his name to fundraisers, mailings and an early endorsement for Mr. Kyrillos. But political analysts said the race presents an opportunity for Mr. Christie to wage a proxy war against Mr. Menendez, no matter who wins the contest.
"There's no question that there's no loss of love between these two," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, about the relationship between Messrs. Christie and Menendez.


Obesity Debate Over Where to Serve School Breakfasts
The New York City Council plans to approve resolutions on Wednesday demanding Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration provides breakfast in the classroom at all city public schools, a policy the administration opposes because officials fear it could increase childhood obesity.
"We can't stand by, year after year, and be among the worst in the country in making sure our kids have access to nutritional food in the morning," said Council Member Stephen Levin, a Brooklyn Democrat and primary sponsor of the resolutions. "It's an injustice for our kids to go to school and sit throughout the school day hungry when they could be fed with federal dollars."
The council's Committee on Education voted 13-1 on Tuesday to approve the resolutions. One calls on the city Department of Education to provide classroom breakfasts. If the Bloomberg administration continues to balk, a second resolution urges the state Legislature to mandate the city offer the breakfasts. The full council is slated to vote on the resolutions Wednesday.
New York City, which runs the nation's largest public school system, currently offers free breakfast to all 1.1 million students, regardless of income, in school cafeterias. But advocates said the city would feed more hungry children if it provided breakfast in the classroom at the start of the school day, rather than merely making it available in the cafeteria.
Since 2008, city schools have been permitted to join a program that allows breakfast in the classroom. The program has expanded to 390 of the city's more than 1,700 schools, but only 67 of the schools currently participating have implemented the program in every classroom. While city officials said they are open to expanding the program further if principals request it, they are opposed to mandating it citywide because of fears it will increase obesity.


Romney, Aide Differ On Fed's Bernanke
Mitt Romney appeared Thursday to dismiss the view of a top adviser who said this week that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should be considered for a third term.
The presumptive Republican nominee told the Fox Business Network that, if he were elected president, he would want to install someone new in the top post at the Fed.
Mr. Romney's comments came as the Fed appears to be moving closer to launching a third major round of bond-buying to bolster the economic recovery. On Wednesday, minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting suggested support is swelling among Fed officials for such action, perhaps as soon as their next meeting in mid-September—a step that would stir controversy less than two months before the election.
Mr. Bernanke was first nominated to become Fed chairman by Republican President George W. Bush, and was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to serve a second term, which expires January 2014.
The Fed chief has not said publicly whether he would want a third four-year term, but many of his acquaintances say they believe he wouldn't.


Two Band Members Flee From Russia
MOSCOW—Two members of the feminist performance group Pussy Riot have fled Russia, days after authorities said they would continue to search for members who had helped stage a protest against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow's pre-eminent cathedral in February.
A Moscow court sentenced three members of the group to two years in prison Aug. 17 for staging the "punk prayer" at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral.
The two women who left the country in the past few days had helped organize the protest, and had decided it was no longer safe to remain in the country, a lawyer for one of the jailed band members said. The two who fled were "involved in the performance at the church," said Mark Feigin, the lawyer. "I don't think they felt safe staying."
The exact roles of the two women in the protest is unclear.
"In regard to the pursuit, two of our members have successfully fled the country!" a Twitter account called Pussy Riot Group reported Sunday.


Hopes, Skepticism Surround Colombia Peace Talks
Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos revealed in an address to the nation Monday evening that the government has been holding secret meetings with the country's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC by its Spanish acronym, in an effort to set up formal peace talks.
The European Union and the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, which both said they welcomed talks, both label the FARC a terrorist organization.
Mr. Santos, a U.S.-educated conservative who oversaw military operations against the FARC while he was defense minister, is expected to announce in the coming days a firm schedule for the talks. They could be held outside Colombia, perhaps in Cuba or Norway, reported Venezuela-based cable station Telesur.


Romney Vows to Expand Programs for Veterans
INDIANAPOLIS—Mitt Romney vowed Wednesday to expand employment and tuition assistance for veterans, taking a quick detour from the Republican National Convention to unveil new policy details in a speech here.
The Romney address at the American Legion convention was designed to contrast his plans for military and veterans' spending with pending Pentagon budget cuts. The speech focused on hurdles faced by the Veterans Affairs Department in providing care to veterans suffering physical, emotional and mental wounds, which Mr. Romney dubbed "reproachable failures."
The Republican presidential candidate's decision to skip out mid-convention to spend part of the day talking to veterans in Indiana was unorthodox.
President Barack Obama addressed the American Legion via video a day earlier.
"I'll be heading back to Florida later today and you may wonder why I'm not down there right now, practicing and polishing my final draft of my speech," Mr. Romney said.


Isle Spats Backdrop for Clinton's Asia Trip
JAKARTA—Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to tour parts of Asia over the coming week in what could be one of the Obama administration's last chances to address escalating territorial disputes across the region ahead of November elections.
Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to meet with leaders of Indonesia, East Timor, Brunei, China and Russia amid growing tensions over competing claims on the islands, shoals and open waters in Asia.
Her visit, say State Department officials, is to further underline the U.S. commitment to stability in the Asia-Pacific as the U.S. untangles itself from commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"She is demonstrating that the U.S. is engaging in the region in a very practical way, by showing up [for multilateral meetings], contributing, listening and adopting soft initiatives," like aid programs across Asia, said Carlyle Thayer, an Asian security expert at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.
During a stop in the Cook Islands Friday to meet with leaders of South Pacific island nations, Mrs. Clinton pledged to continue helping to maintain security in the region and to protect the flow of maritime commerce. She also called on China to "act in a fair and transparent way" in the Pacific as it expands its influence there.


Bill Clinton to Take Center Stage
CHARLOTTE, N.C.—President Barack Obama has sometimes kept his distance from Bill Clinton, but the former president has something that is making him invaluable to Mr. Obama's re-election effort—a tenure that voters remember as a time of prosperity and growth.
That is why Mr. Clinton has been given a plum speaking slot at the Democratic convention on Wednesday. It is also why Mr. Obama has broadly embraced his predecessor's help, ranging from a star turn in a television ad to joint fundraising appearances to a plan for him to aggressively stump for the president's re-election this fall.
"President Clinton has enormous credibility on what works and what doesn't on the economy," said John Podesta, who served as Mr. Clinton's White House chief of staff and headed Mr. Obama's transition team. "He's particularly persuasive at talking to an important swing constituency—working-class white voters. Clinton gets them, and they know it."
The two presidents have experienced their share of tension since the hard-fought 2008 presidential primary contest between Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton. Aides say that has subsided, and the two now have a strong relationship, if not a warm one.
That contrasts with the distance between Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former President George W. Bush, who was barely mentioned at last week's GOP convention in Tampa. But the Obama-Clinton alliance hasn't come easy. The two men's styles could hardly be more different, and Mr. Obama rose to the presidency by elbowing aside Mr. Clinton's wife, whom the president later named secretary of state.


Police 'Tragedy'
A police officer responding to an armed robbery at a deli in the Bronx mistakenly shot and killed a 20-year-old worker attempting to escape from the store early Friday, officials said.
Reynaldo Cuevas was struck by a single shot to his shoulder and later died at a hospital after the 1:50 a.m. incident that began when three men—one masked and carrying a .32-caliber revolver—entered the Aneurys Deli on Franklin Avenue and announced a robbery.
Mr. Cuevas was shot after he ran out of the store and collided with a responding officer who had his gun drawn, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said at news conference. The victim "ran straight into the officer," and the officer's gun fired, Mr. Kelly said.
"The two became entangled at which point, we believe, the officer accidentally discharged his weapon with one round entering Mr. Cuevas' left shoulder," Mr. Kelly said, displaying surveillance footage of the incident.
Calling Mr. Cuevas's death a "tragedy," Mr. Kelly said there was nothing "procedurally" wrong with the officer, a seven-year veteran, approaching the unfolding robbery with his gun drawn.


A PC Virus on a Mac
Q: I've just downloaded the Parallels 8 software (trying to migrate some Windows software from our family PC to my MacBook Pro). Because I am now running PC applications via Parallels 8, will I need to install and maintain antivirus software as if my MacBook Pro was a PC?
A: Yes, definitely, and it's included in Parallels. Since Parallels creates a virtual Windows PC on your Mac, it can run Windows software and that includes malicious software, which is almost always written to run in Windows. So, as with any Windows PC, I strongly recommend you run security software inside the faux PC created by Parallels. This software only operates when Parallels and Windows are running.
Q: I have a desktop and laptop, both running Windows XP and Excel 2003. I use a USB stick to move spreadsheets between the PCs so I can work on them at either computer. But now I want to purchase a new laptop running Windows 7 and Excel 2010. Will I still be able to go back and forth between my new laptop and old desktop, updating an Excel spreadsheet?


Romney Seeks Traction in Swing States
For Mitt Romney, good news came Friday with word that President Barack Obama had added a stop to his travel schedule next week. For the first time this election season, Mr. Obama will campaign in Wisconsin, a confirmation that the traditionally Democratic state is now in play.
Mr. Romney could use more such tactical victories. A series of polls in recent weeks has shown that he is not solidifying support in many of the states he needs to win, leaving him a narrow path to a majority in the Electoral College.
Of nine states that have swung between the parties in recent elections, the Republican presidential nominee holds a clear lead only in one, North Carolina. He trails in the two largest swing states—Florida and Ohio—as well as in Virginia, new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist Poll surveys released Thursday found.
Some Romney supporters acknowledge the uneasiness other Republicans harbor about the race, even while they remain optimistic. "It's a good thing that people are concerned," said Brian Ballard, a Florida lawyer and leading fundraiser for Mr. Romney. "Complacency would kill us."
In the face of the recent polling, the Romney campaign is putting forward this strategy: It is returning its focus to the economy, adding money to its ad buys in several battleground states and eyeing a breakthrough moment at the debates with Mr. Obama next month.


GOP Lawmakers Laud Fast and Furious Report
WASHINGTON—House Republicans on Thursday said the Justice Department watchdog's report on the bungled Fast and Furious gun-trafficking sting vindicated their efforts to pressure Attorney General Eric Holder over missteps in the operation.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, held a hearing at which he lauded Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's inspector general, for a report Mr. Issa said would help restore faith in the department.
Mr. Horowitz's report cited a "pattern of serious failures" in Fast and Furious and said officials should have asked more questions about the risky operation.
Fast and Furious was a gun probe run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Phoenix in 2009 and 2010. Agents allowed sales of about 2,000 guns, costing about $1.5 million, to suspected smugglers. The aim was to track the weapons to top traffickers, but agents seized only about 100 of the firearms. Many have turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S., including two at the scene of an Arizona shootout where a U.S. border agent, Brian Terry, was killed.
The report "confirms what the Oversight Committee has known for quite some time: The Department of Justice has let the American people down. Specifically, it confirms the fundamental conclusions we have found in our 19-month investigation into Operation Fast and Furious," Mr. Issa said.


Noonan: The Romney Campaign Needs a New CEO
"Nothing is written." That was T.E. Lawrence to the Arab tribesmen in Robert Bolt's screenplay, a masterpiece, of "Lawrence of Arabia." You write no one off. Nothing is inevitable. Life is news—"What happened today?" And news is surprise—"You're kidding!"
But you have to look at the landscape and see the shape of the land. You have to see it clearly to move on it well.
So here's one tough, cool-eyed report on what is happening in the presidential race. It's from veteran Republican pollster, now corporate strategist, Steve Lombardo of Edelman public relations in Washington. Mr. Lombardo worked in the 2008 Romney campaign. He's not affiliated with any candidate. This is what he wrote Thursday morning, and what he sees is pretty much what I see.
"The pendulum has swung toward Obama." Mitt Romney has "a damaged political persona." He is running behind in key states like Ohio and Virginia and, to a lesser extent, Florida. The president is reversing the decline that began with his "You didn't build that" comment. For three weeks he's been on a roll. The wind's at his back.
How did we get here? What can turn it around?


ROTC Returns to the Ivies
Cambridge, Mass.
It was the strangest of Harvard sights: camouflage in the classroom. Flip-flops and sneakers replaced by combat boots, T-shirts and baseball hats by battle fatigues.
Spanning four decades, the battle over ROTC began during the Vietnam War but continued well after the U.S. military had regained its status as the public's most trusted institution. The chief barrier to reconciliation was demolished in December 2010, when Congress voted to repeal "don't ask, don't tell," the Clinton-era law that prohibited gays from serving openly in the military. Three months later, Harvard reopened its doors to ROTC, as did Columbia, Stanford and Yale. Today, of the Ivy League institutions that parted ways with ROTC, only Brown, my alma mater, hasn't changed its policy.
Attending that first class, I was reminded of literary scholar Paul Fussell's observation that "Every war constitutes an irony of situation because its means are so melodramatically disproportionate to its presumed ends." Like Vietnam, the ROTC debate became a proxy war, a contest of oversize ideas and imagined consequences.


Graft Trial Jolts Brazil's Ruling Party
BRASILIA—Brazil's Supreme Court is handing down a stream of guilty verdicts, with more expected in coming days, in a major corruption trial that is damaging President Dilma Rousseff's ruling Workers' Party and weighing on its prospects in local elections next month.
The rulings, including a guilty verdict for corruption and embezzlement against the former speaker of the lower house, are unusual in a country where powerful politicians are rarely held accountable, raising hope that the courts may start to take a harder line against corruption.
The trial involves seven-year-old allegations that Workers' Party officials used public money to buy votes in Congress and fund campaigns during the previous administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, one of Brazil's most popular presidents.
The trial began on Aug. 2, and so far, 17 of the 37 defendants have been found guilty variously of corruption, embezzlement and money laundering, among other charges, including Workers' Party congressman João Paulo Cunha, the former lower-house speaker.
No one has yet been sentenced, and Brazilian law is vague about punishments, which could range from some jail time to the possibility of losing their elected positions.


City to Expand Shelters Amid Jump in Homeless
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration plans to open at least five new shelters by the end of this year in response to a substantial increase in New York City homelessness, expanding the number of new shelters that have opened since May to 15.
Three family shelters, with a total of 169 apartment-style units, and two shelters for single adults with another 234 beds, are expected to open in the coming months, officials said Tuesday.
Two shelters will be in the Bronx; one each will be located in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.
Between May and August, the city opened 10 new shelters: six for families with children, one for single adults and three for adult families.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeless Services couldn't say whether the expansion is among the largest or most rapid in recent decades. She called the shelter portfolio complex, with the agency opening and closing shelters based on demand.


Conflicts Resonate in Iranian's U.N. Farewell
UNITED NATIONS—Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's farewell appearance at the United Nations General Assembly exposed the deepening political fissures inside Tehran, in a surprising finale to eight annual U.S. speeches better known for his insults and threats.
As Mr. Ahmadinejad began his U.N. speech on Wednesday morning, Iranian security forces jailed for six months his top media adviser after convicting him of publicly insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Later, Mr. Ahmadinejad voiced disapproval of his government's economic policies, an unexpected criticism that came during a meeting with reporters.
The political discord played out as Mr. Ahmadinejad wrapped up his final trip to New York as president under Iran's term limits. His second four-year term ends in June.
Visibly subdued, the Iranian president confirmed to hundreds of journalists gathered at the New York news conference that he had been notified of the imprisonment of his aide, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, and that he was still "digesting" the news. Mr. Javanfekr had questioned in print whether women's use of head-to-toe coverings was originally a national custom or had been imported from elsewhere.


Tourist Surge Brings Tensions
Decimated after the 2001 terrorist attacks, Lower Manhattan has bounced back so dramatically, city tourism officials say the neighborhood now is second only to Times Square on the must-do list of the millions of visitors who pour into the city's borders every year.
International tourists spent nearly $1 billion in the area below Canal Street last year, NYC & Company, the city tourism bureau, is set to report Friday. The 9/11 memorial, which opened last year, draws most of the curious, but other popular spots include Zuccotti Park, site of the Occupy Wall Street protests; the Brooklyn Bridge; a Century 21 discount store; and the historic cobblestone streets near the southern tip of Manhattan.
But along with the resurgence have come headaches. Residents complain that their once-quiet enclave has been overwhelmed. Most say they are excited about the area's revival, but they say they have paid a price in streets that can be a cacophonous, chaotic mix of traffic jams, congested sidewalks and overflowing trash bins.
Community Board 1, which represents Lower Manhattan, unanimously passed a resolution last week calling on the city to increase mass-transit service on weekends, to encourage buses to use ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel and to take steps to prevent tourist bottlenecks on sidewalks. On Friday, a City Council committee will take up the issue amid a push for more help from City Hall.
"It's been difficult," said Julie Menin, the board's former longtime chairwoman and a candidate for Manhattan borough president.


FDNY Hiring Set
A federal judge overseeing New York City's compliance with court-ordered reform to discriminatory hiring practices at the Fire Department has cleared the way for the department to hire new firefighters for the first time since 2008.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis on Friday approved a motion filed by the city that was seeking permission to begin hiring from a pool of nearly 10,000 candidates who scored in the top tier of an exam administered in March and April. The exam was designed under supervision of a court-appointed special master, Mary Jo White, a former U.S. attorney.
In his decision, Judge Garaufis found that the new exam didn't adversely impact minority test takers and that the test focused appropriately on job-related skills.
His decision caps a years-long legal battle between the city and a group representing minority firefighters in which Judge Garaufis characterized the FDNY as "a stubborn bastion of white male privilege."
After a minority recruitment drive that began in 2011, more than 41,000 people took the new exam with minorities representing 46.5% of the people who scored in the top tier.


Croton-on-Hudson Offers Inviting Harbor
The Westchester village of Croton-on-Hudson offers many of the trappings of an idyllic waterfront community, but residents say it also has a welcoming feeling sometimes not found in such settings.
"There's no keeping up with the Joneses here," says Grace Koch, a broker with Houlihan Lawrence who has lived in the village since 1978. "There are people with a wide variety of income levels, professions and political viewpoints in the community," she said, adding that it is "a very pretty, very friendly place."
The village covering nearly five square miles has an elaborate expanse of park land and publicly accessible waterfront with stunning views of the Hudson River. Historically a magnet for the creative and intellectual set, the village counts poet Edna St. Vincent Millay and actress Gloria Swanson among its one-time residents.
Locals say that while the mostly middle-class community draws from varied backgrounds, it is ultimately a tight-knit place where some have lived for generations.
Among other draws for newcomers to Croton-on-Hudson is its school system, with young families prominent among buyers in the village, brokers say.


GOP Invites Witnesses in Libya Probe
WASHINGTON—Republican lawmakers investigating the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans invited their first witnesses for a hearing next week.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Wednesday asked the State Department to allow two of the agency's security officials to testify at a hearing Oct. 10. The officials are Charlene Lamb, deputy assistant secretary for international programs, who was involved in reviewing security requests, and Eric Nordstrom, a regional security officer who was stationed in Libya from September 2011 to June 2012, according to a letter Mr. Issa sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The State Department declined to comment.
Oversight committee investigators have interviewed Mr. Nordstrom, and he confirmed that the U.S. mission in Libya requested additional security after a series of incidents in Benghazi earlier this year including attacks on Western diplomatic outposts, according to a congressional official familiar with the interview.
Other State Department officials also are expected to be asked to testify at the Oct. 10 hearing, the official said.


Kabul Prepares for U.S. Talks
KABUL—Afghanistan's demands to curtail immunity for U.S. forces will be a main stumbling block in negotiations over the long-term American military presence here, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Dadfar Spanta said, highlighting the issue that derailed similar U.S. talks with Iraq a year ago.
Mr. Spanta explained Kabul's negotiating positions in an interview as the lead American negotiator arrived in the Afghan capital for meetings to prepare for the talks on a bilateral security agreement, which are slated to start in the coming days.
At stake is the future of U.S. influence in this strategic region after more than a decade of war—including whether the U.S. will be able to fight al Qaeda and other extremist groups in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan's tribal lands.
Both sides said the discussions won't be easy. The talks come at a time of distrust between the two governments, when U.S. officials are angry over increasingly frequent incidents of Afghan troops turning their weapons on American soldiers, and after Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticized the conduct of the war and what he sees as U.S. violations of Afghan sovereignty.
The State Department declined to comment on the substance of the negotiations.


Judges Set to Hear DeLay's Appeal
AUSTIN, Texas—Tom DeLay, the former U.S. House majority leader, continues his attempt this week to seek a reversal of his conviction on campaign-finance charges—and avoid three years in jail.
In 2010, an Austin jury found Mr. DeLay guilty of one count of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering for funneling $190,000 in corporate donations to fellow Republicans running for the Texas Legislature in 2002. The jury decided this violated state laws that prevented companies from contributing to candidate campaigns. In early 2011, a state judge handed down a three-year prison sentence. Mr. DeLay has been free on bond ever since as he appealed.
Brian Wice, Mr. DeLay's attorney, calls the case "as inherently a political prosecution as any that I've seen." He plans to argue that state money- laundering law doesn't apply to the manner in which Mr. DeLay delivered funds. Mr. Wice says that Texas law in 2002 covered use of cash in money laundering, but not personal checks or bank checks, so what Mr. DeLay did wasn't technically against the law.
Assistant Travis County District Attorney Steve Brand disagreed and said "the conviction was properly obtained and the judge made sound rulings and we're confident it will be upheld on appeal and we'll get a fair hearing."


Stab Suspect Fled U.S.
A man suspected in the fatal stabbing of a popular youth soccer coach fled to Mexico on Tuesday, shortly before investigators learned of his identity, a law-enforcement official said.
Orlando Orea, 32 years old, is believed to have used cash to buy a one-way ticket to Mexico City on an Aero Mexico flight which departed Kennedy Airport Tuesday morning, the official said. Mr. Orea was identified by detectives Tuesday afternoon as the suspect in the slashing of New York Red Bulls youth program coach Michael Jones, 25, in the pre-dawn hours on Sunday, the official said.
Mr. Orea's name was placed on a no-fly list but investigators soon discovered he had already boarded the flight hours before they narrowed their focus to him, the official said. Mr. Orea, a resident of Queens, had several aliases and it was unclear if he had any connections to Mexico, the official said.
He is believed to have encountered Mr. Jones on West 14th Street at about 4:30 a.m. Sunday and stabbed him in what police said could have been a case of mistaken identity.
A Wednesday memorial service was planned for Mr. Jones.


Shipping Firms Facing New Challenge
Piracy off the coast of East Africa has fallen dramatically over the past year thanks in part to better naval surveillance and shipping companies going to sea with armed maritime security contractors. The British government now is trying to persuade Sri Lanka not to upset the new status quo.
Sri Lanka has been a hub for private-security firms in the region because it allows them to carry weapons in and out of the country. But Sri Lanka wants to close these arms warehouses, fearing that weapons might fall into the hands of local militants.
Other countries have taken a stricter view on private firms bringing arms into their ports. With Sri Lanka now also thinking of closing its doors to weapons caches for security firms, shipping experts worry that shipboard security could be jeopardized.
"While the international shipping community objects to these proposed changes, the Sri Lankan government is extremely unlikely to back down on this decision," said Arvind Ramakrishnan, principal Asia analyst at consultancy Maplecroft.


Search Ends With Suicide
A New York man suspected in the shooting death of his estranged wife and her companion, a prominent reggae artist, apparently killed himself in a Miami apartment as police closed in on him late Tuesday, a law-enforcement official said.
Joseph Kerzinan, 42 years old, was the main suspect in the slaying of Tracy Bennett and Wayne Hamilton, both of whom were fatally shot early Saturday morning in the parking lot of a motel in the Bronx.
Based on phone records and information from a confidential informant, New York Police Department detectives were able to track him to a Miami apartment building on Northwest Second Avenue, the official said.
A team of NYPD detectives, federal marshals and local Florida police surrounded the property at about 10:30 p.m. and used a bullhorn to order the residents of four apartments there to exit the building, the official said.
Mr. Kerzinan allegedly attempted to escape through a back door but was met by officers. He turned back and re-entered the home where, moments later, four gun shots were heard, the official said.


Bo Trial Unlikely Before Meeting
BEIJING—Former Communist Party star Bo Xilai was expelled from the nation's rubber-stamp parliament, state media reported on Friday, stripping him of his legal immunity and setting the stage for his trial on a number of alleged offenses.
But the move, which was widely expected, still leaves unclear whether the trial will take place before November's party meeting, and an attorney Mr. Bo's mother-in-law hired to defend him said it is unlikely to take place before then.
Chinese leaders are thought to have been anxious to conclude the scandal surrounding Mr. Bo ahead of the 18th Party Congress, which begins on Nov. 8 and which will mark the start of a once-a-decade leadership change. His wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted in August of murdering a British businessman.
But having reached an agreement in September that Mr. Bo should also face criminal charges, party chieftains are now preoccupied with the leadership change, making it increasingly unlikely a trial will happen before the meeting, party insiders, lawyers and analysts said.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress terminated his post as a congress deputy, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday. The move was made "according to the law," said a statement from the Standing Committee quoted by Xinhua.


Parents, Nannies Reel After Children's Deaths
Silvana Nuzzo's nanny was almost apologetic when she arrived for work in Forest Hills on Friday morning.
"'It's just so awful, it gives all of us a bad name,'" said Ms. Nuzzo, recalling her nanny's words. "I said, 'Listen, of course this terrifies me. It's so scary. But you're not a stranger anymore. You're family.'"
Still, knowing that it was a high-anxiety day, Ms. Nuzzo said her nanny took extra care over the course of the day to text photos of her 15-month-old son on the swings and video of him talking.
Across the city, parents and nannies alike were shaken by news that a nanny was suspected in the deaths of two Upper West Side children she cared for. Although considered an extremely rare violent act, the incident highlighted the delicate and sometimes tense relationship between parents and nannies, and it raised questions about trust in these most intimate of arrangements.
It also highlighted the blind faith many parents put in virtual strangers due to the nanny industry being largely underground and unregulated.


Another Massachusetts Pharmacy Surrenders License
A second drug-mixing pharmacy in Massachusetts has surrendered its license, after state inspectors said they found "significant issues" in the areas where it made injectable medicines.
Massachusetts health officials said Sunday that they have asked Infusion Resource LLC of Waltham, Mass., to stop operating and quarantine its products. Infusion Resources surrendered its license over the weekend, after inspectors grew concerned about its ability to make sterile drugs during an Oct. 23 inspection. The pharmacy will ask its roughly 40 patients and their doctors to return all of the medicines they've received, the state health officials said.
"These actions are precautionary, and there is no evidence of contamination," Madeleine Biondolillo, who heads the Massachusetts health department's bureau of health-care safety, said.
The move follows an investigation into another compounding pharmacy, New England Compounding Center of Framingham, Mass., whose steroid injections have been linked to a deadly meningitis outbreak. NECC has surrendered its license, and the state is taking steps to permanently revoke it.
Infusion Resource provides IV antibiotics, nutrition treatments and other infusion therapies to patients across southern New England for use at their homes or in doctor's offices, health centers and nursing facilities, according to its website.


Maryland Voters Back New Casino
The march among states to allow more gambling continued Tuesday as Maryland voters elected to allow a new casino following a brutal and expensive battle between two major gambling companies.
Maryland voters decided 52% to 48% to allow a sixth casino in the state, as well as to expand other gambling operations. The new law broadens a proposal approved by voters in 2008 that first allowed commercial casinos in the state but limited gambling to five slot machine parlors. Already, several have opened, including one that is the first-ever casino in the country built into an existing mall.
The initiative—called Question 7—allows the state to issue a new casino license in Prince George's County, which is near Washington, D.C. Companies hoping to win the license or prevent it from being issued spent roughly $80 million stumping for their positions, making it the most expensive political battle in Maryland's history.
MGM Resorts International hopes to get the license, which would allow it to build an $800 million casino just outside the city. The Las Vegas-based company led a coalition of gambling interests that will get reduced taxes, the ability to add table games to casinos that had been limited to slot machines, and the permission to run 24 hours a day.
The coalition spent about $35 million on the campaign, said MGM spokesman Gordon Absher.


U.S. Unit Takes Permanent Posting in Poland
LASK, Poland—The U.S. Air Force officially stationed a small detachment of soldiers at a base here in central Poland on Friday, part of Washington's bid to reassure an important European ally without jeopardizing ties with Russia.
The unit is just 10 soldiers strong but represents what Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak called "the first permanent presence of American soldiers on Polish soil." The move was touted by Poland's government, which has for years asked for a U.S. military presence to protect the former Eastern Bloc country from a resurgent Russia.
The U.S. soldiers will support squadrons of U.S. fighter planes that will come to Poland on 14-day rotations, once every three months, to help train Polish pilots who fly American-designed F-16s.
U.S. Ambassador Stephen Mull said the permanent posting represents "a small step, but it is a very important and historic step because it marks the beginning of an unprecedented level of cooperation on Polish, European and American security."


China Minister Condemns U.S. Report
BEIJING—China's minister of commerce, Chen Deming, lashed out at a U.S. congressional report critical of two Chinese technology companies but shrugged off election campaign accusations from President Barack Obama.
Speaking to reporters Saturday, Mr. Chen said warnings by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee against Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. were "outrageous" and displayed a "Cold War mentality."
He also suggested this could trigger a response from China. "If you treat me like a Trojan horse, how do you expect me to respond?" he said in reply to a question.
The congressional report, issued last month, said the companies posed risks to U.S. national security because their equipment could become a vehicle for Chinese spying. The companies have denied the allegations.
But asked about President Obama's insistence during the election campaign that his administration had been tough on unfair trade practices by China, Mr. Chen said: "We don't take election campaign statements very seriously."


An Agenda for Growth
The U.S. has had to contend with anemic growth in recent years as well as a loss of competitiveness in some industries. What can President Obama and Congress do to increase long-term growth and U.S. competitiveness? Can the public and private sectors work together in promoting growth?
The Wall Street Journal's David Wessel moderated the task-force discussion on generating economic growth. Here are edited excerpts of their presentation of their priorities.
FRANCISCO D'SOUZA: The consensus of the group was that there hadn't been a lot of debate about what fundamentally drives competitiveness and how government and business can work together to further that agenda.
In particular, there was a lot of conversation around the role of small business and what we can do together—between the public and private sectors—to drive the competitiveness of small business. For example, access to global markets, which small business tends to have limited, if any, access to.


Stephens: The Truth About Gaza
Sometimes it behooves even a pundit to acknowledge his mistakes. In 2004 as editor of the Jerusalem Post, and in 2006 in this column, I made the case that Israel was smart to withdraw its soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip. I was wrong.
My error was to confuse a good argument with good policy; to suppose that mere self-justification is a form of strategic prudence. It isn't. Israel is obviously within its rights to defend itself now against a swarm of rockets and mortars from Gaza. But if it had maintained a military presence in the Strip, it would not now be living under this massive barrage.
Or, to put it another way: The diplomatic and public-relations benefit Israel derives from being able to defend itself from across a "border" and without having to get into an argument about settlements isn't worth the price Israelis have had to pay in lives and terror.
Withdrawal also meant putting the notion of land-for-peace to a real-world test. Would Gazans turn the Strip into a showcase Palestinian state, a Mediterranean Dubai, or into another Beirut circa 1982? If the former, then Israel could withdraw from the West Bank with some confidence. If the latter, it would put illusions to rest, both within Israel and throughout the Western world.


Law Firm's Ownership Case Stays Alive
A Jacoby & Meyers LLP lawsuit challenging restrictions on nonlawyer investment in law firms isn't dead yet—despite its dismissal earlier this year.
The consumer law firm (and law-firm television-advertising pioneer) filed suit last year, saying a New York rule barring nonlawyers from owning stakes in law firms had hurt Jacoby & Meyers's ability to expand and serve working-class clients.
The suit, which said the rule violated various constitutional rights, was dismissed in March by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan. He said the firm lacked standing to raise its claims and that New York laws beyond what Jacoby & Meyers was challenging would bar the firm from accepting nonlawyer investments.
During oral arguments on the firm's appeal last month, a three-judge panel repeatedly asked why Jacoby & Meyers hadn't filed an even broader challenge to ownership rules.
On Wednesday, the panel said the suit should be sent back to district court so the plaintiffs could expand the complaint.


Susan Rice Set to Meet GOP Critics
WASHINGTON—Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is set to meet Tuesday with three Republican senators who have criticized the explanations she gave for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. The move could help mend relations on Capitol Hill and smooth the way for Ms. Rice's widely anticipated nomination as secretary of state.
Ms. Rice, who is considered the front-runner to succeed departing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will meet in the morning with Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, aides to the senators said.
President Barack Obama is expected to announce his choice for the post as early as this week. Apart from Ms. Rice, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) is considered a top candidate.
Ms. Rice had requested the Tuesday meeting on Capitol Hill, an aide to one of the senators said.
The three lawmakers had appeared at a news conference on Nov. 14 and vowed to block her confirmation as Mrs. Clinton's successor. Mr. McCain said that Republicans should do "whatever is necessary" to withhold confirmation in the event Mr. Obama nominated her.


Obama's Cliff Offer Spurned
President Barack Obama made an opening bid in budget talks with Republicans that calls for a $1.6 trillion tax increase, $50 billion in infrastructure spending in 2013 and new power to raise the federal debt limit, a provocative set of demands that Republicans said represented a step backward in efforts to avoid looming tax increases and spending cuts.
The proposal marked an opening salvo in negotiations over the fiscal cliff and represented a particularly expansive version of the White House's wish list, with a heavy focus on tax increases and spending proposals—including keeping in place a payroll-tax cut and extended unemployment benefits.
Republicans haven't put any comparable offer on the table. They have indicated willingness to accept $800 billion in revenues over 10 years, half the amount Mr. Obama proposed. And they have sought far more in spending cuts in exchange for their concessions on taxes.
"No substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks," House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said after meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Thursday and speaking to Mr. Obama by phone Wednesday night. "The White House has to get serious."
The talks, which have weeks to go, will likely result in many twists and turns, with the White House offer a potential starting point for negotiations. It already has signaled it isn't wedded to raising the top income-tax rates all the way back to peak Clinton-era levels. Both sides have a good sense of what concessions they are willing to offer, but neither wants to go first for fear of losing leverage.


Snake Tale: How Venom Binds U.S., Iran
CAMP LEATHERNECK, Afghanistan—Relations between Iran and the U.S. are poisonous, with one exception: an antidote for snake bites.
In a surprising—and irony-rich—byproduct of the Afghan war, the Pentagon finds itself dependent on a scientific research arm of the Iranian government to treat bites by Oxus cobras, Haly's pit vipers and other snakes peculiar to the battlefields of southwest Asia.
Despite U.S.-led international sanctions designed to paralyze Iran's trade with the outside world, the Defense Department buys the drugs through a middleman, with orders totaling 115 vials at $310 apiece since January 2011.
Medical guidance issued by U.S. Central Command says drugs made by Iran's Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute "should be the first line of antivenin therapy" because they counter venoms of the most-common Afghan snakes, said a U.S. officer who has read it.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers Razi antivenin an experimental drug, and requires military doctors to file a report any time the antivenin is used. FDA-approved antivenins won't work on Afghan snake bites because they are manufactured from snake venom found in U.S. species, say military doctors.


High Court Will Rule on Gay Marriage
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court entered the debate over gay marriage, saying it would hear cases challenging a federal law and a California law that limit the rights of same-sex couples.
The move Friday means that a defining legal moment is set to come by next June, after a year in which gay marriage assumed even greater prominence in the national debate and social acceptance widened. President Barack Obama in May said he personally believed gay couples should have the right to wed, becoming the first sitting president to take that stand.
In November, Maine, Maryland and Washington state became the first states to approve gay marriage at the ballot box, joining six other states and the District of Columbia that had authorized the unions through legislative acts and judicial rulings.
The decision to take both cases—including one involving California's voter-approved ban on gay marriage—suggests the justices are ready to tackle the issue fully.
The first case before the high court concerns the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law denying benefits to same-sex spouses. Two federal appeals courts have found it unconstitutional, ruling that no legitimate purpose justifies penalizing lawfully married people because they are gay.


Obama Takes Fiscal-Cliff Case to Public
Anyone seeking a road map for President Barack Obama's handling of the current budget crisis need only consider his actions during the 2011 fight over the debt limit—and assume he'll do the opposite.
In debt talks last year, Mr. Obama made concessions on spending cuts early and often. This time, he has so far made none while remaining uncompromising on his ideal level of tax increases.
In the last go-round, he holed up in the White House for marathon meetings that excluded some leaders in Congress. Now he is taking his case to the public and tapping his network of campaign supporters to maximize pressure on congressional foes.
And while the White House saw business executives last year as adversaries on the outside peering in, they are now being wooed by Mr. Obama and brought into the West Wing with a seat at the table.
"They've internalized what went wrong the last time around during the debt-ceiling debate," said Jim Manley, a former spokesman to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.). "They've learned their lessons and taken a harder line toward the Republican leadership and taken their case directly to the American people."


Afghans Probe Corruption at Borders
KABUL—Afghan President Hamid Karzai has launched a crackdown on unofficial taxes that have allegedly enriched the country's power brokers, a move that senior officials said was prompted by a Wall Street Journal article about an influential governor.
As a result, Kabul has shut down an operation at the Torkham Gate border crossing on the route from Kabul to Peshawar, according to Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal. Officials at the crossing levied an unauthorized tax, on top of the legitimate tax collected there, U.S. officials have said. They allege the operation was a lucrative source of revenue for Nangarhar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai, a presidential aspirant who was once a favorite of U.S. military commanders.
Gov. Shirzai, who has previously dismissed the allegations that he was running an illegal tax-collection operation as politically motivated, couldn't be reached to comment.
Mr. Karzai last month created a commission to probe unauthorized revenue collection at Afghanistan's border crossings and customs-collection points, said Mr. Karzai's spokesman, Aimal Faizi. The aim was "to see where there were cases of illegal tax, and to report it to the palace," Mr. Faizi said.
Members of the commission—headed by Mohammad Tahir Safi, an adviser to Mr. Karzai—have visited 12 provinces mostly in the eastern and northern parts of the country, said Mr. Faizi. They arrived Monday in the southern city of Kandahar, a trade hub for goods brought in from Pakistan, provincial officials said.


Midtown Shooting Victim Was Lured
A Los Angeles man with a puzzling past that includes stints in both law school and jail was apparently lured to a Midtown street where he was shot at point-blank range Monday in what authorities have said appears to be a "hit."
A video of the murder of Brandon Lincoln Woodard viewed by The Wall Street Journal appears to show the 31-year-old glancing at his phone and buildings numbers along West 58th Street moments before Monday afternoon's murder, as though he was searching for an address. His killer, who had been waiting at the spot for about 20 minutes, shoots him once in the head before turning to enter a waiting getaway car.
Based on the video footage, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said at a news conference Tuesday that it was a "distinct possibility" that Mr. Woodard was lured to the spot.
Mr. Woodard, who arrived in the city Sunday night after booking a one-way ticket from California, had a criminal record that included 20 arrests in that state, Mr. Kelly said. NYPD detectives have been dispatched to Los Angeles.
"It was very brazen," Mr. Kelly said of the murder, adding, "Obviously, a lot of cameras in New York City, so you can characterize it as either being brazen or foolhardy."


U.S.: Damascus Fires Scud Missiles
WASHINGTON—The Syrian government fired Scud missiles at targets inside Syria in recent days, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, a development some saw as a sign of an escalating battle.
A U.S. official said there have been no confirmed casualties from the missile strikes and the American government hasn't determined why forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the weapons.
The Scuds were fired from Damascus into northern Syria. Some officials played down the weapons' significance, saying Mr. Assad's intent was unclear.
Chemical weapons could be loaded onto Scuds, but there is no evidence that Mr. Assad was testing the missiles for that purpose, the official said.
The regime also could have just been firing the Scuds to scare Syrian rebels or signal its intent to use tougher tactics.


Argentine Firms Get Creative
Newsan SA made its name in Argentina making Sanyo plasma-television screens and JVC video cameras. But last year, the electronics company branched out in a surprising direction: it created a fishery business to catch, freeze and export shrimp and hake.
The decision had nothing to do with a strategic business plan and everything to do with navigating Argentina's increasingly unorthodox macroeconomic policies, which many of the country's businesses say are becoming a headache.
Last year, President Cristina Kirchner's government sought to stem an outflow of dollars, help companies and protect local industry by creating a new trade policy that allows imports of foreign goods only if they are equally matched by exports.
To comply with the law, Newsan now sells around 3,600 tons of seafood a year to buyers in Europe, Russia, China and elsewhere—to be allowed to import needed electronic parts for its main business. It is also considering exporting biofuels.
Such deals are a short-term fix for companies as they cope with import restrictions, but critics say they are inefficient for businesses and the new jobs they create could vanish if the government changes its policy. Indeed, Argentina officials are now weighing whether such deals will be allowed to continue, said a person close to the government.


Chávez's Condition Worsens
CARACAS—Venezuela's ailing President Hugo Chávez is facing new complications and remains in a delicate state as he recovers from cancer surgery in Cuba, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday night in a nationally televised address.
"After 19 days since the complex surgery, the state of President Chávez's health continues to be delicate, presenting complications that are being tended to, in a process not without risks," said a somber-sounding Mr. Maduro, who was recently tapped by the leader as his preferred successor.
As Mr. Chávez, who has been battling a postoperative respiratory infection, remains in a "difficult situation," Mr. Maduro said he had planned to stay in Havana with the president and his family in the coming hours to see how his health evolves. Mr. Maduro didn't give specific details on the new problems faced by the leader.
Mr. Chávez is slated to be sworn into his next term on Jan. 10, but doubts over his ability to attend the ceremony have launched a debate over the country's constitution. Many constitutional experts say the president-elect must attend the inauguration or be declared absent from office. That would trigger new presidential elections within 30 days, which is a legal requirement in Venezuela when a president is incapacitated or dies.


Obama Draws Flak For Signing Defense Bill
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama dropped his veto threat and signed a defense-policy bill into law, prompting complaints Thursday from human-rights advocates that he was breaking a promise to close the terrorist-detention system set up by his predecessor, George W. Bush.
The National Defense Authorization Act gives rough spending levels for 2013 and sets policy for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama approved the law, saying it was a key piece of legislation for the military, but issued a signing statement criticizing some policy restrictions in the measure.
In the statement, Mr. Obama singled out curbs on his authority to transfer detainees held in Afghanistan and Guantanamo. Although the White House has issued previous such signing statements, this year's language was stronger than in the past.
Mr. Obama said restrictions on transferring non-Afghan detainees held at the Parwan detention facility in Afghanistan were unconstitutional and "could interfere with my ability as commander-in-chief to make time-sensitive determinations" about prisoners held in a war zone.
He also repeated his objections to restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo to sites in the U.S. He said limits on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees "substitutes the Congress's blanket political determination for careful and fact-based determinations, made by counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals."Mr. Obama said the curbs prevent the executive branch from prosecuting some detainees in federal courts and violate the constitution's separation-of-powers principle.


Mermaids and Coconuts
PALM BEACH, Fla.—Things don't change all that often in Palm Beach. That's one of the great things about this little island, but also one of the frustrating things about it. When we come here for the holiday season, as many people who don't want to go somewhere far flung (St. Barth, Gstaad, Cabo, Sydney) do, we know what we're getting into.
This year, surprisingly, there were some new(ish) things to toot about.
First, the Coconuts, the big black-tie party at the Flagler Museum on New Year's Eve that brings out everyone from the Kochs to the Meighers to the Geary-Rosses, had, as usual, a spectacular fireworks display by David Koch. This week's show was in honor of Robert Leidy, one of the Coconuts—an all-male group of big shots that pays for this party annually—who passed away just before the weekend. Mr. Leidy, who went by "Lighthouse," was the ex-son-in-law of Lilly Pulitzer Rousseau and was a Palm Beach fixture for 60 years.
The soundtrack to this year's display featured tunes from the Killers and Nicki Minaj and the "Dark Knight Rises" score. But a new addition to the cascades in the sky: green lasers. For your viewing pleasure, there was a host of outdoor furniture and other decorative elements courtesy of Bronson van Wyck. (In previous years, the party has been tented.)
It doesn't sound like a lot, but in Palm Beach, where, if you'll recall, last year's big news was the re-opening of a Publix supermarket, lasers and outdoor furniture mean progress.


Cuomo Seeks Overhaul in Gun Control
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing for a five-part package of new gun-control laws in negotiations with state legislative leaders, including making the assault-weapons ban stricter and requiring gun owners to renew their licenses every five years, according to people familiar with the talks.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is eager to be among the first governors to sign new gun laws in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and a Christmas Eve shooting in Webster, N.Y. He hopes to propose a new package of gun laws in his annual state of the state address Wednesday.
Mr. Cuomo is pushing for five items, according to people close to the negotiations.
The one that could generate the most opposition is requiring gun owners to periodically renew their licenses. Currently, gun licenses in New York state are "generally valid until revoked," except in New York City where they must be renewed every three years, and in suburban Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties, where they must be renewed every five years, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
Mr. Cuomo also plans to propose broadening the definition of what kind of gun falls under the state's assault-weapon ban and would seek to limit the size of gun ammunition magazines, the people said.


Solis to Leave Labor Secretary Post
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis will step down from her post, the latest member of President Barack Obama's cabinet who won't stay for a second term.
The president said Wednesday that the former California congresswoman had been "a tireless champion for working families" and a "critical member" of his economic team and the effort for recovery.
Ms. Solis had a tough nomination process during which congressional Republicans suggested she would favor unions over employers. In her first months on the job, she announced she was "a new sheriff in town," irking business groups who have accused the agency of taking a more forceful approach to enforcing rules instead of a cooperative one. She oversaw tougher enforcement on everything from workplace-safety laws to regulations that govern overtime pay.
The daughter of a Teamsters union member, Ms. Solis grew up in a large Mexican-American family and became the first Latina to serve in a cabinet-level position. She said in a statement that she made the "difficult" decision to resign over the recent holidays while with her family in California.
A person familiar with Ms. Solis's plans said she may run for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.


Ferry Captain Says Boat Lost Engine Power
The captain of the ferry that crashed Wednesday in Lower Manhattan described to federal investigators a frantic wheelhouse scene as the throttles aboard the 140-foot boat—and then its engines—malfunctioned moments before it struck an East River pier.
Capt. Jason Reimer's narrative, provided Thursday to investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, gave the clearest suggestion yet that mechanical failure triggered the morning rush-hour accident that sent more than 70 people to hospitals in the area.
The NTSB interviewed all five crew members, including Mr. Reimer for three hours. In addition to interviewing crash victims, the agency will examine maintenance records, prior incident reports and, on Friday, the damaged ferry vessel itself, said safety-board member Robert Sumwalt. Navigational and communications records were collected on Thursday from a Coast Guard facility on Staten Island.
Seastreak Chairman Robert Barker confirmed Wednesday that the ferry company overhauled the Seastreak Wall Street last year, replacing the water-jet propulsion engines with which it was launched in 2003 with twin diesel propeller engines, to improve its fuel efficiency.
Federal investigators will be trying to determine if that overhaul was related to Wednesday's accident.


For Splendid Isolation, Hard to Top Todt Hill
Todt Hill, in Staten Island, seems very far from Manhattan.
Hundreds of acres of parks and woodlands comprising part of Staten Island's beloved Greenbelt are in or abutting the neighborhood. Detached houses are set on 10,000-square-foot lots. The area lacks shops, restaurants and even sidewalks.
Yet it is only a short drive down the hill to stores and services, and around 20 miles into Manhattan.
"It has a bucolic atmosphere—trees and winding streets. It's suburban living, but it's very convenient to New York," says Connie Profaci, owner of Connie Profaci Realty, who has lived on Todt Hill for 40 years.
That woodsy, suburban atmosphere—as well as its spacious Tudors, Colonials, ranches and some sprawling mansions—are part of what make Todt Hill one of Staten Island's priciest, most sought-after neighborhoods, where even starter homes can rarely be had for less than $1 million. A house on the east side of the hill was used as the home of Don Corleone in "The Godfather."


How to Impress a Bird
Even their names are vivid: Magnificent Riflebird. Splendid Astrapia. Superb Bird-of-Paradise.
Found in the New Guinea region and in parts of Australia, birds of paradise are a study in evolution and sexual selection. Males often have extravagant, colorful plumage to attract potential mates, made possible by a shortage of predators (there's less danger their appearance will attract unwanted attention). And in most species, the males perform complicated courtship dances. The exhibit "Birds of Paradise" at the National Geographic Museum in Washington, along with a book by Tim Laman and Edwin Scholes, offers research, photographs and video of the 39 species of the bird—which, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote in 1869, "must be ranked as one of the most beautiful and most wonderful of living things." Here is a look at some photos from the book; the exhibit runs until May 12.
GREATER BIRD OF PARADISE. Nearly every morning, the adult males of this species gather on branches and display their yellow feathers. In one courtship pose, the male turns away from the female on a downward-sloping branch so his plumes cascade over his back.
VICTORIA'S RIFLEBIRD. Sexual selection at work: This male riflebird shows how female mating preferences have altered the aerodynamically optimal wing shape in favor of blunttipped feathers that make an attractive ovoid display.
WILSON'S BIRD OF PARADISE. Evolving in isolation on New Guinea's mainland, both males and females of this species have an unusual skullcap of bare blue skin subdivided by a narrow web of tiny feathers.


Without Chávez, Annual Speech Falls Short
CARACAS—Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, filling in for ailing leader Hugo Chávez, announced the appointment of a new foreign minister as part of a seven-minute state of the union address Tuesday—a far cry from the nine-hour session delivered by Mr. Chávez last year.
Mr. Maduro gave few details in his brief remarks, but repeatedly invoked the name of Mr. Chávez, who hasn't been seen in public since he underwent surgery for his cancer in Cuba in early December. Lawmakers allied with the ruling socialist party repeatedly chanted "Onward, Comandante!" in support of Mr. Chávez as the vice president took the podium.
Mr. Maduro, whom Mr. Chávez chose as his successor should the populist succumb to cancer, suggested the leader's health had improved slightly in the past few days.
"Yesterday we saw President Chávez and we can tell you that he is climbing the hill, and is fighting with his spirit, his love..filled with the will to live," Mr. Maduro said. "[President Chávez] told us to send greetings to all the assemblymen and assemblywomen."
Mr. Maduro went on to announce that Mr. Chávez had designated former Vice President Elías Jaua as foreign minister, a job Mr. Maduro had held while also vice president.


U.S., U.K. Vow to Pursue Hostage Takers
The British and U.S. defense leaders vowed Saturday to go after the perpetrators of the Algerian terrorist attacks as well as Islamist militants fighting in Northern Mali.
At a joint news conference with his British counterpart, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said no terrorist group can attack the U.S. and "get away with it."
"Just as we cannot accept terrorist attacks against our cities, we cannot accept attacks against our citizens and our interests abroad," Mr. Panetta said at a London news conference with his British counterpart as the three-day crisis was ending on a tragic note. "Neither can we accept an al Qaeda safe haven anywhere in the world."
Philip Hammond, the British defense minister, added Britain's pledge: "The full force of the United States, United Kingdom and African countries will bear down upon them," he said.
But as U.S. officials and their allies consider their next steps in Africa, the Algeria crisis demonstrates the outer limits of U.S. influence in Africa's al Qaeda fight.


Mali Advance Shows Paris's Dilemma
After a decade of trying to reduce its military footprint in Africa, France on Tuesday gained European financial backing for its latest mission in Mali, where 2,000 newly arrived French soldiers this week helped to reverse an advance by al Qaeda-backed militants.
The Mali campaign, which comes just weeks after France dispatched soldiers to two other countries, underscores Paris's Africa dilemma: In spite of its increasingly stated desire to distance itself from the continent's conflicts, it has continued to step in.
Late last year, President François Hollande gave voice to French reluctance, telling Senegalese lawmakers he would provide only logistical aid and training to West African countries fighting radical Islamists roaming through Mali and the vast Sahara. He wouldn't send troops, he stressed.
Just weeks later, French soldiers are on the ground in Mali. After French troops helped to retake the towns of Diabaly and Douentza from al Qaeda-backed rebels on Monday, Mr. Hollande says he is ready to see out a protracted war against a foe that is blamed for last week's deadly attack on a remote natural-gas complex in Algeria, which left at least 37 foreign nationals dead.
"Only France could decide and make this intervention," Mr. Hollande said in a speech in Dubai last week.


Obama Praises Clinton in Joint Interview
His endorsement is a prize a future Democratic presidential candidate might want.
Her political pedigree is an asset any Democratic candidate would envy.
Yet through a joint interview on CBS's "60 Minutes," President Barack Obama gave no endorsement and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made no declaration she wanted his job.
It made for tantalizing political theater as the two old rivals from the 2008 campaign talked about the unlikely path that led them to that moment.
Mr. Obama had sought the interview, he said, to "publicly thank" Mrs. Clinton for serving four years in his cabinet.


Immigration Proposal Gains Support
The push to overhaul immigration laws gathered momentum Monday, as a bipartisan Senate proposal to liberalize the treatment of illegal immigrants drew support from business and labor groups. Some leading Republicans, who represent the biggest potential obstacles, either held their fire or welcomed the plan.
The Senate proposal was unveiled by eight senators a day before President Barack Obama was expected to release his own blueprint for an immigration-law overhaul in a Las Vegas speech.
House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) gave a measured welcome to the senators' framework, even though it offers a path to citizenship for many of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants—something conservatives have long opposed. The framework was co-written by Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a conservative who has argued that his party has to improve its standing among Latino voters.
A Boehner spokesman said that the speaker "welcomes the work of leaders like Sen. Rubio on this issue and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days."


Secret Service Head to Step Down
WASHINGTON—The director of the U.S. Secret Service is retiring from the agency that guards the president following a prostitution scandal last year.
Mark Sullivan, who led the agency for six years, apologized for his agents' alleged involvement with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, days before President Barack Obama was scheduled to speak at an economic summit there. The accusations came to light up in April after an early-morning payment dispute between a Secret Service employee and a woman he had brought to his room in Cartagena. The agents have offered different accounts: Some say they brought women to their rooms but didn't pay for sex, according to a person familiar with the matter.
In 2009, Mr. Sullivan apologized after a Virginia couple vying for a spot in the cast of a reality-TV show was able to crash a White House state dinner for the prime minister of India. The couple, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, were photographed with Mr. Obama on the receiving line. They also had their pictures taken with Vice President Joe Biden.
Some lawmakers called for Mr. Sullivan's resignation following the prostitution scandal, saying it raised questions about the agency's culture and discipline.
Mr. Obama said in a statement Friday, "I want to thank Mark Sullivan for nearly 30 years of service."Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised Mr. Sullivan's decades of government service. "His commitment to keeping our country and its top officials safe is unparalleled, and his devotion to the mission of the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security has been unwavering," she said in a statement.


Directors of Boy Scouts Urged to End Gay Ban
IRVING, Texas—Gay-rights activists gathered at the Boy Scouts of America headquarters here Monday, urging the group to drop its longtime ban on gay scouts and leaders.
Members of the Scouts' national executive board, who began their annual meeting this week, are considering whether to end the policy, leaving it up to local organizations that sponsor scout troops to set their own membership rules.
But about a dozen activists, including several scouts and former scout leaders, said Monday that they want all troops across the country to be open to gay members.
The activists, some dressed in their scout uniforms, delivered boxes they said contained more than a million signatures on a petition against the ban gathered through Change.org.
Jennifer Tyrrell, a former den leader who said she was ousted from the Scouts because she is gay, said "1.4 million people agree that we should all enjoy scouting."


L.A. Sheriff Disciplines Deputies
LOS ANGELES—The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said it intends to fire seven deputies who officials say had formed a clique within the department. The deputies allegedly share similar tattoos and engaged in "inappropriate behavior," according to a department spokesman.
Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore declined to detail the specific behavior from the group that the sheriff found objectionable. But the planned firings come as the department—the largest sheriff's department in the U.S.—and its leader, Sheriff Lee Baca, have come under criticism for allowing secret gangs and cliques to develop within the department.
"This is another example that the sheriff will not tolerate any behavior that flies in the face of our core values," Mr. Whitmore said.
The names of the deputies wasn't made public.
Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Sheriff Baca and other sheriff's officials in federal court, alleging deputies abused inmates in county jails and formed their own secret gang units within the jails.


For Salmon, Magnetic Fields Point Way
Salmon find their way home guided by a natural magnetic map, confirming that fish are attuned to the planet's force field and use this sixth sense to navigate hundreds of miles in open water, scientists reported Thursday.
To find out how fish get their bearings, researchers compared records of local magnetic fields and 56 years' worth of commercial fishing data documenting routes taken by homing sockeye salmon during the annual Fraser River salmon run—which historically yields about $1 billion or more in fish in the Pacific Northwest and adjacent Canada.
By a fluke of geography, these spawning salmon must detour north or south around Vancouver Island to reach the waters of their birth along the Fraser River in British Columbia. The researchers, led by Nathan Putman at Oregon State University, determined that a salmon's route was shaped by the magnetic setting of its internal guidance system, which appeared to shift to keep the fish aligned with changes in the intensity of the local magnetic field.
"The fish are basically forced to make a decision" about their route, said biologist Kenneth Lohmann at the University of North Carolina, who was part of the research team. "That decision about the direction of their approach can be related to very slight changes in the earth's magnetic field."
No one is certain how the salmon sense magnetic fields, but previous laboratory tests with sea turtles have shown those creatures readily detect changes in the magnetism around them. Earlier this year, researchers discovered that the flesh of rainbow trout contains microscopic crystals of magnetite—the same mineral used in compass needles.


Couple Won't Face Charges for Adopting Deer
Criminal charges were dismissed Friday against an Indiana couple who gained national attention after being prosecuted for taking in an injured baby deer they named Dani.
Jeff and Jennifer Counceller were charged with a misdemeanor of illegal possession of a whitetail deer after fostering the animal for nearly two years on their small farm about 60 miles east of Indianapolis. State conservation officers said they found the deer living in a pen on the Councellers' property and planned to kill it because of its extensive exposure to humans. Before that happened, the deer got loose.
The decision to drop the charges came after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence asked the state Department of Natural Resources to re-evaluate the case. On Friday, prosecutors said the department requested dismissal, but declined to comment further.
The couple said they were glad the charges had been dropped and remained surprised at the attention their case drew. Ms. Counceller said she now hopes state legislators will re-examine the law under which she and her husband were charged to ensure an act of compassion isn't treated as a crime in the future. As for Dani, Ms Counceller said the deer seems to be adapting to life in the wild. She recently saw her drinking from a nearby pond with other deer.

Mixed Blessing for Snow-Removal Firms
The blizzard howling through the Northeast this weekend will put a strain on hundreds of local snow-removal firms, which have been struggling with downward pressure on their fees and rising costs for equipment and insurance.
Heavy snowfall should be good for snow removers. But too much all at once can force them to pay large amounts of overtime, and in some cases the firms are locked into contracts that cap the amount of revenue they will receive in a season, no matter how much snow falls.
"Everybody needs service at the exact same time," said Grant Mitchell, senior vice president of Divisions Inc., Newport, Ky., which does snow removal, landscaping and other work for retailers in about 30 metro areas. "You have guys in trucks for 30 hours, 45 hours. It's kind of dangerous, but it is also an opportunity. A lot of guys go longer than they should sometimes."
In the past decade, dozens of national or regional management companies like Divisions have sprung up to provide one-stop snow-removal shopping for large retail chains and other customers with facilities scattered around the nation. That is convenient for customers that don't want to have local managers negotiate for services at each location. It also allows big companies to use their size to press for discounts. The snow-removal management companies then find local entrepreneurs to do the work.


Cyprus Vote Looms as Clock Ticks
NICOSIA, Cyprus—Cypriots head to the polls Sunday to elect a president who will need to unblock an increasingly thorny, multibillion-euro bailout for the island's teetering banking system and its cash-strapped government.
Opinion polls show conservative leader Nicos Anastasiades, head of the center-right Democratic Rally party is expected to top a three-way race for president with about 40% of Sunday's vote. If no candidate gets 50%, a runoff would come a week later.
Mr. Anastasiades's closest rival is Stavros Malas, backed by the Cypriot communist party AKEL, with the support of 23% of poll respondents. Giorgos Lillikas, supported by the socialist EDEK, has about 20% backing.
But the clock is ticking on the country's bailout, and Mr. Anastasiades will need all of the advantages he can draw upon to help mend relations with Europe. Those were sorely tested by his predecessor's unyielding stance on austerity measures and privatizations that Europe and the International Monetary Fund have demanded.


Last Marine Standing: Tormented by Survival
MISSOULA, Mont.—Many troops have lost a close friend in combat. Travis Williams lost them all.
On bad days he is tortured by guilt for having gotten out of Iraq alive. On good days he feels guilty for not having a bad day. "It's like I lost 11 family members, and I'm still trying to figure out what to make of it," Lance Cpl. Williams said.
During more than a decade of continuous war, the military has made a priority of treating post-traumatic stress disorder, learning lessons from Vietnam veterans whose psychological problems went unchecked. Now, clinicians fear many combat veterans are suffering from symptoms that PTSD treatment alone doesn't best address.


Conservative Wins Round in Cyprus
NICOSIA, Cyprus—Cyprus's conservative leader Nicos Anastasiades emerged victorious in a first-round presidential vote Sunday but failed to clinch the absolute majority needed and will face a second electoral battle next week in a vote seen as key to the country's bailout hopes.
Mr. Anastasiades is expected to win in the second round, and he will immediately be responsible for negotiating a multibillion-euro loan for Cyprus and turning around the country's recession-struck economy, which is threatening to become the next flash point in Europe's debt crisis.
Mr. Anastasiades, a 66-year-old lawyer by profession, is seen by analysts as being able to get the Cypriot economy, now in its second year of recession, back on its feet. He also is a stalwart of Europe's conservative party caucus and close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who publicly supported his bid during a visit to Cyprus in January.
He will need those skills to help mend relations with Europe, which were sorely tested by his predecessor's unyielding stance on austerity measures and privatizations that Europe and the International Monetary Fund have demanded.
Despite some hopes that Sunday's vote would lead to a clear, first-round win for Mr. Anastasiades, analysts said the results were expected. With 100% of the vote counted, Interior Ministry data showed that Mr. Anastasiades, head of the center-right Democratic Rally, or Disy, garnered 45.46% of the vote. He will face off against Stavros Malas, backed by the Cypriot communist party AKEL, who was backed by 26.9% of voters. Giorgos Lillikas, supported by socialists EDEK, came in third with 24.9% of the vote Sunday.


Bangladesh Considers Ban on Islamist Party
DHAKA, Bangladesh—The Bangladesh government said Sunday it was considering banning an Islamist party that it blames for the death of an online activist who helped organize the mass protests that have swept the nation's capital.
Ahmed Rajib Haider was found hacked to death late Friday in front of his home, police said. The 26-year-old blogger helped coordinate protests to demand harsher punishments for Islamists accused of committing atrocities in the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The demonstrations are Bangladesh's largest in two decades.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, speaking on television after visiting Mr. Haider's home Saturday evening, blamed Jamaat-e-Islami, the nation's largest Islamist party, for his slaying.
Shafique Ahmed, the law minister, said Sunday that the government was considering banning Jamaat-e-Islami because of its "violent tactics."
"The parties which practice killing people cannot be allowed to operate," he said at a news briefing.


Suspect 'Fit' in Shop Killings
Doctors have determined that a Staten Island apparel salesman is fit to stand trial in the alleged serial killings of three Brooklyn shopkeepers.
In a psychological evaluation released Friday, two doctors who evaluated Salvatore Perrone, 64 years old, determined he suffers from "grandiosity," but his disorder isn't a "mental disease."
"According to these two doctors, the defendant appears to be cleanly groomed, does not suffer from any hallucination or delusional thinking, understands the charges against him," Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Alan Marrus said. "He expresses no suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
Appearing in the court, Mr. Perrone was subdued but combative during the proceeding, asking for a new attorney and insisting that he have contact with his daughter, whom prosecutors have said doesn't want to be involved in her father's life.
He spent more than 10 minutes sparring with Justice Marrus, rejecting advice from the judge not to speak and to listen to his attorney.


Christie Unveils Modest Budget
TRENTON—Gov. Chris Christie unveiled a $32.9 billion budget Tuesday that would fund the administration's phased-in statutory pension obligation, expand Medicaid coverage to the uninsured and roll out an additional $214 million in tax cuts for businesses.
In his last budget plan before seeking re-election, Mr. Christie proposed a safe course of spending that includes a modest $97 million increase in school funding and $40 million in contingency money for costs associated with superstorm Sandy not covered by federal aid.
Mr. Christie's budget address lacked the bold rhetorical flourishes of last year, when he championed the "New Jersey comeback" and promised to cut income taxes by 10% across the board. The Legislature, controlled by Democrats, refused to pass the tax cut or a compromise proposal to reduce property taxes last year, citing weak revenues in the state.
But the Republican governor hasn't dropped the income tax issue, and said Tuesday he would make it an issue for voters as he campaigns.
"You have reneged on your promise to me and the people of New Jersey," Mr. Christie said during the 43-minute speech at the Statehouse. "I am content to let the voters decide this in November."


Campaigns Woo Latinos
New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio stood outside City Hall last week reading a few sentences in Spanish from a cue card held by an aide in hopes of reaching a Latino audience with his message about borough inequality.
Mr. de Blasio, one of a handful of candidates seeking the Democratic mayoral nomination, has stepped up efforts in recent months to summarize his news conferences in Spanish. On Tuesday, he lunched with Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., the city's highest-ranking Latino official, at Enzo's on Arthur Avenue.
As the race to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg heats up, so has the competition for Latino voters, a swath of the electorate campaign officials and political experts say will be influential. Roughly one-quarter of the city's electorate—in both the Democratic primary and the general election—is expected to be composed of Latino voters, according to polling and census data.
"I feel like the homecoming queen—everyone wants to take me to the dance," said Mr. Diaz, a Democrat who hasn't yet endorsed anyone in the mayor's race. He spoke twice with John Liu, an expected mayoral candidate before breaking bread with Mr. de Blasio.
"It's a giant awakening," Mr. Diaz said of the Latino vote and the community's growing sense of political empowerment. "The four major Democratic candidates have a lot of work to do in the primary to make sure they can get the Latino vote..No one has a lock on it."


A Culinary 'Peep Show'
When you're on the social circuit you get used to the same, ordinary kinds of hors d'oeuvres: maybe some shrimp cocktail, a crab cake, a little bruschetta, a fried macaroni-and-cheese square, perhaps some tuna tartare in a form of edible cone.
Pinch, a Manhattan catering company that is the brainchild of a chef (Bob Spiegel) and a set designer (TJ Girard), tries to do it all a little differently. They make party food interactive. Two waiters for instance, might carry around a long piece of wood on which focaccia pizza hangs from hooks. Lots of cute tools might be used for a "chef's table," including a squeegee and a plant humidifier.
Pinch had an open house recently, what they call a "peep show," at its West Chelsea headquarters to show off some of its latest machinery and, of course, its menu items.
There was a make-your-own sashimi bar featuring various toppings (tomato, almonds, farro) and infusions (ponzu, yuzu, red pepper) and the mini plates slid on marbles. Later, for dessert, the mise en scène would be converted into a similar construct of panna cotta in flavors like buttermilk and butterscotch.
Along the wall hung various vats of beverages, alcoholic and nonalcoholic, including a virgin hibiscus cocktail, as well as tequila-grapefruit-jalapeño and vodka-apple-ginger concoctions. A waiter filled your glass with your choice via a large turkey baster.


Notable & Quotable
Sen. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.), in a letter to the White House Office of Management and Budget, Feb. 26:
The administration is warning sequestration may force the laying off or furloughing of air traffic controllers, border patrol officers, food inspectors, Transportation Security Administration screeners, or civilians supporting our men and women in combat in Afghanistan. I would suggest the better approach is to consolidate duplicative positions with overlapping responsibilities and nearly identical jobs.
In just the past two years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified more than 1,362 duplicative programs accounting for at least $364.5 billion in federal spending every single year. . . .
During a time of budget cuts, it is irresponsible to pay two or more people to do the same job, while laying off other employees in essential positions performing critical duties.


Boston Archbishop Urges Steps to Fight Sex Abuse
VATICAN CITY—Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Archbishop of Boston, said the next pope will face a "monumental task" in making sure measures aimed at combating sexual abuse by clerics are enforced across Roman Catholicism's global sprawl.
"The Holy See is going to have to mandate into these polices. They have to make sure that they're well written and then to guarantee that their implementation is carried out," the cardinal said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Stopping sexual abuse by priests is one of the toughest tasks facing cardinals as they gather in Rome to elect a successor to former Pope Benedict XVI. A few cardinals voting in the next conclave to elect Benedict XVI's successor have apologized for failing to report allegations of sexual abuse over the decades, allowing abusive priests to continue their ministry long after the first allegations surfaced.
In recent years, the Vatican has required bishops conferences around the world to come up with measures for handling allegations. The results have not been uniform, nor have they been as stringent as some of the "zero tolerance" policies adopted by Cardinal O'Malley in Boston and in other dioceses in the U.S.
A crucial task facing the next pope, Cardinal O'Malley said, is reviewing the thicket of guidelines developed by national bishops conferences world-wide. Bishops in Italy and Germany, for example, created their own policies a decade after the crisis first exploded in Boston, under Cardinal Bernard Law, Cardinal O'Malley's predecessor. By then, hundreds of people had come forward across Europe to report allegations of sex abuse dating back decades.


Golan Strategy Is Revisited as U.N. Waits to Recover Hostages
The abduction of 21 United Nations peacekeepers in the Golan Heights this week and other spillover from Syria's civil war has forced the U.N. and Israel to shift operations at a once-quiet border—and spurred talk of a possible withdrawal of the 39-year-old observer force.
An agreement was reached with Syrian rebels on Friday for the release of the peacekeepers, but efforts to retrieve the hostages were postponed until Saturday because of fighting and darkness, the U.N. peacekeeping department said Friday. The Filipino observers had been held in the Syrian village of Jamlah since Wednesday.
The U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on the strategic Golan Heights plateau, established through an agreement ending the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, was largely peaceful until late last year, when peacekeepers reported getting caught in the Syrian crossfire.
Syrian fighting this week prompted the peacekeepers to abandon two outposts and, on Friday morning, evacuate seven peacekeepers to Israeli-controlled territory, the U.N. and the Israel army said.
U.N. officials described dangers for the over 1,000 international members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or Undof. "Of course we are looking very closely at the modus operandi of the mission in the situation it is facing, of very degraded safety and security conditions," peacekeeping chief Hervé Ladsous said Friday.


Suu Kyi Calls for Party Unity
YANGON, Myanmar—Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking to thousands Saturday at the National League for Democracy's first-ever congress, called for unity amid reports of infighting and fractures in the party as it edges closer to Myanmar's general elections in 2015.
"Our country is a union, and that is why our party's unity is very important," said Ms. Suu Kyi, speaking at the congress's opening ceremony at the Royal Rose restaurant in Yangon, minutes from the party's headquarters. "To be united in a diverse group is very important for our country."
The three-day congress is seen as the first test of the party's ability to organize and set its political priorities as it transitions from a symbol of defiance to an entity capable of governing the country. That is particularly important given the NLD's support among average voters could propel Ms. Suu Kyi into the presidency in 2015, political experts say.
The NLD—founded in the wake of a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1988—meets as it is coming under fire by some human rights groups and others who accuse it of straying from its founding principles in its transition to a mainstream party under current President Thein Sein's nominally civilian government. Ms. Suu Kyi, whose speech was projected by microphones outside the restaurant to hundreds of supporters crowding the streets nearby, maintained the party's vision is to "establish real democracy" in Myanmar.
In the days leading up to Friday's opening of the congress, the party's historic gathering was marred by reports that members were suspended for behavior that might "destroy unity within the party," according to a news release by the NLD. In party offices in townships across the country, reports of heated arguments and threats to resign—particularly between younger members and longtime volunteers—-were common. Other members expressed grievances about the party's new procedures, specifically the practice of electing central committee members from states rather than appointing them primarily from Yangon, as was done in the past.


Push for Storm 'Bank'
Sen. Charles Schumer is expected to urge federal officials Monday to let New York turn some of its superstorm Sandy grant money into a loan fund to pay for long-term infrastructure improvements.
In a letter to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Mr. Schumer said such a fund could provide low-cost financing and help attract private money to make improvements to important facilities and to brace infrastructure for climate change. The fund would use a chunk of the $16 billion in Community Development Block Grant funding approved after Sandy.
Mr. Schumer wrote that climate change would "continue to threaten the vulnerable networks that connect our communities and power our everyday lives."
"A loan fund like this is a creative way to take the resources we've already secured and do much more with them," Mr. Schumer said through a spokesman. It "would allow us to leverage private capital and expertise, and tackle the scores of mitigation efforts that need to be completed, but that we otherwise would simply not have the resources for right now, and do them in a more cost-effective way."
Mr. Schumer's proposal shouldn't be a surprise to watchers of the veteran Democrat, who backed a similar proposal for a national infrastructure bank. Such an institution would use long-term loans to finance rebuilding of some of the U.S.'s aging infrastructure, from water and sewer projects to bridges, roads and highways. The national bank was pushed unsuccessfully in 2011 by President Barack Obama. Then-Sens. Christopher Dodd and Chuck Hagel advanced an earlier version of the proposal the Senate.


CIA Steps Up Iraq Role
WASHINGTON—The Central Intelligence Agency is ramping up support to elite Iraqi antiterrorism units to better fight al Qaeda affiliates, amid alarm in Washington about spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria, according to U.S. officials.
The stepped-up mission expands a covert U.S. presence on the edges of the two-year-old Syrian conflict, at a time of American concerns about the growing power of extremists in the Syrian rebellion.
Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist network's affiliate in the country, has close ties to Syria-based Jabhat al Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front, an opposition militant group that has attacked government installations and controls territory in northern Syria. The State Department placed al Nusra on its list of foreign terror organizations in December, calling the group an alias for al Qaeda in Iraq.
In a series of secret decisions from 2011 to late 2012, the White House directed the CIA to provide support to Iraq's Counterterrorism Service, or CTS, a force that reports directly to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, officials said.
The CIA has since ramped up its work with the CTS—taking control of a mission long run by the U.S. military, according to administration and defense officials. For years, U.S. special-operations forces worked with CTS against al Qaeda in Iraq. But the military's role has dwindled since U.S. troops pulled out of the country at the end of 2011.


Council Member Assails the Police After a Rampage
A protest over the fatal police shooting of a teenager that turned violent Monday night in Brooklyn led to a terse exchange between a City Council member from that district and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly on Tuesday.
The council member, Jumaane Williams, assailed Mr. Kelly during a planned council hearing, accusing him and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of ignoring minority neighborhoods where tensions exist between police and young people. Such tensions reached a violent climax on Monday when a small group attending a vigil for the deceased teenager began clashing with police and damaging shops.
"We're not going to pretend that what happened yesterday was just one incident," Mr. Williams said during the hearing. "It is not about the details of one shooting, it is about how you and the NYPD and the mayor have reacted to these communities. It is about years of not being heard."
Mr. Kelly responded that the council member was omitting the fact that 16-year-old Kimani Gray was armed with a pistol when he was approached by two plainclothes officer late Saturday. Police officials have said Mr. Gray had pointed the loaded weapon at the officers before he was shot several times.
Anger over Mr. Gray's killing was evident late Monday, when a group of about 40 people splintered from a peaceful vigil and began hurling bottles at officers at the 67th Precinct in East Flatbush. One officer suffered minor injuries, police said.


Japan Approves BOJ Leadership
TOKYO—Japan's parliament approved the government's pick for the central bank's leadership, setting the stage for the incoming governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, to push ahead with more-aggressive easing measures than his predecessor.
The nominations of Mr. Kuroda and his two deputies—Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso--passed a vote in the upper house following their approval in the lower house on Thursday.
Mr. Kuroda, who has criticized policies under current Gov. Masaaki Shirakawa, has told his confirmation hearings that he was ready to do "whatever it takes" to achieve 2% inflation in two years, a target that the BOJ was forced to adopt in January, soon after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into power on a platform calling for further action from the BOJ.
The 68-year-old Mr. Kuroda, who is stepping down as the president of the Asian Development Bank to take on the new role, has said the BOJ should step up its purchases of Japanese government bonds by increasing the amount as well as buying longer bonds. He has also said buying of more risk assets by the central bank was an option.
The former Japanese top currency official has also said the BOJ should consider bringing forward the starting date of its planned "open-ended" purchases of JGBs from January of next year.


Anti-Euro Party Mobilizes in Germany
A prominent group of anti-euro German economists and business leaders has formed a political party to challenge Germany's support for euro-zone bailouts, a move that could test the ruling center-right coalition's hold on conservative votes in the fall general election.
With just six months until the election, the new party, which calls itself Alternative for Germany, is unlikely to gain enough traction to win seats in Parliament, analysts say. Yet even if the party comes in below the 5% threshold needed to win representation, it could still attract enough conservative votes to prevent a return of the current coalition government, a combination of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, their Bavarian sister party, and the pro-business Free Democrats.
If Ms. Merkel's coalition were to fail to garner enough support in the fall, she would likely be forced to reach out to the center-left Social Democrats, Germany's other mainstream political party, to form what Germans call a "grand coalition." While such a combination would enjoy a large parliamentary majority, it would likely force Ms. Merkel's party to abandon a more-conservative agenda.
Ms. Merkel's party has gone on the offensive. "If this group criticizes our euro policies, we will stand firm," Volker Kauder, the head of the conservative parliamentary group, said last week. "There is an alternative to everything—even to the euro. But every alternative to the euro is much worse for Germany."
At an event outside Frankfurt to kick off their election campaign last week, the Alternative for Germany's leadership left little doubt about their objective.


Immigrant-Wage Issue Stalls Talks
Negotiations between business and labor appeared to reach a breaking point Friday evening, jeopardizing the Senate's effort to finish its plan to overhaul the nation's immigration system.
A disagreement over how to set the minimum wages for future low-skilled workers effectively stalled immigration negotiations Friday evening. A bipartisan group of senators working on immigration legislation are expected to continue discussing the issue over the two-week recess but it appears they will fall short of their goal to reach a consensus on how to rewrite immigration laws before they leave town.
Even if the senators are able to reach an agreement amongst themselves, they may have to push forward without business and labor's endorsements, threatening the future of any immigration plan once the group unveils it.
The AFL-CIO and Chamber of Commerce have broadly agreed to create a new visa category for low-wage workers, which would allow them to come to the U.S. and work year-round. The number of workers would rise and fall, based on the state of the U.S. economy, and would have an overall cap of 200,000 a year, people familiar with the talks said.
Wages for those workers have proven more difficult to negotiate. The Chamber said it would support the formula government agencies currently use to calculate wages for low-skilled workers who come to the U.S. under a temporary visa program. That would ensure that immigrants were paid similar wages to their American colleagues, according to the Chamber.


New, Blue Figure Joins Consulate
Is it a bird? A leaping stick-figure man? Viewers of a new sculpture by Joel Shapiro at the nearly completed American consulate in Guangzhou, China, will have to figure it out for themselves.
"I want the piece to be a celebration of individuality," said the 71-year-old, a major American figure in abstract art, in a video interview from his home in New York, ahead of a trip to China. Viewers can interpret the sculpture "any way they'd like to, as long as it stimulates the imagination," he added.
In China last week, Mr. Shapiro oversaw installation of the 22-foot-tall outdoor, bright-blue metal work. The bright-blue Guangzhou work is made of six parts bolted together. Why blue? "I like blue," Mr. Shapiro said, wearing a blue button-down shirt. But he also explained that the hue "gives the piece a solidity, and it doesn't reflect light. It amplifies the mass of the piece." He chose a durable matte paint used by the U.S. military for covert operations.
The sculpture, the result of a seven-year process, was made in a foundry north of New York City. Mr. Shapiro donated the piece to the consulate at the behest of the nonprofit Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies, which paid for the fabrication of the sculpture and has given work by over 200 artists to American outposts in more than 140 countries. In 1999, FAPE arranged for the artist to donate a 40-foot-high bronze sculpture for the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa.
Mr. Shapiro is a New York City native who has participated in the important biennials held at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art and regularly exhibits in galleries. At Christie's New York last May, an almost-11-foot-tall untitled bronze of his, created from 2000 to 2003, sold for $266,500.


Large Crowd Rallies Outside High Court
WASHINGTON—Inside the Supreme Court, the lawyers and justices were debating gay marriage. Outside, in louder voices, a large crowd was doing the same.
The case regarding California's Proposition 8 has been more than four years in the making, and many in the crowd had waited a long time for the chance to express their views outside the nation's highest court.
The crowd was tightly packed and lively, quickly gaining energy as the sun warmed the chilly morning air and a string of speakers delivered passionate speeches. Most participants carried signs, chanted slogans and wore stickers that made it easy to distinguish supporters from opponents of gay marriage.
The event was mostly peaceful, although one heated exchange broke out shortly after oral arguments began.
A parade of people opposed to gay marriage moved in a line through First Street in front of the court—some shouting "one man, one woman"—prompting supporters to try to drown them out. One man approached the opponents, accused them of being "bigots" and told them to "own their hate."


Fewer Students Suspended
The number of New York City suspensions issued to public-school students last fall plummeted by more than a third after the city relaxed disciplinary policies.
Students received more than 16,000 suspensions between July and December, a 36% decrease from the nearly 25,250 suspensions during the same time period in 2011.
Over the summer, the Department of Education said schools could no longer mete out suspensions for more minor misbehaviors such as swearing, smoking or leaving school without permission. In addition, students were given less severe punishments for defying authority or entering schools without permission.
Previously, those infractions could trigger suspensions of more than five days, and now the disciplinary code limits the suspension to five days.
The changes were in response to widespread criticism, including from advocates and City Council members, of the rising number of students suspended.


A Different Kind of Civil War Memorial
The opening credits of "House of Cards," the new Netflix-produced political thriller, are set against time-lapse views of Washington that include the Capitol and the Kennedy Center. Yet the most prominently featured landmark, the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial, is likely to be less familiar to most viewers.
Its relative obscurity today is unfortunate, because this monument is one of the greatest works of commemorative art this country has produced. More than a monument, it is a symbol both of Washington's aspirations as a city at the dawn of the 20th century and of the nation's increasing prominence at that same moment.
More than 250 feet wide and 70 feet deep, the memorial sits at the foot of the Capitol. An expansive reflecting pool fans out before it, with the National Mall beyond. At the center of a broad stepped marble plaza, a bronze portrait of Grant stands atop a tall marble pedestal. Four recumbent lions flank the statue, while low-relief panels on the pedestal's sides depict marching infantrymen. On either side but at some remove are two massive bronze sculptural groups, one depicting a cavalry charge, the other a field artillery unit wheeling into battle position.
After his death in 1885, Union veterans who had served under Grant campaigned for a monument to be erected in Washington. Their efforts led to Congress appropriating $250,000 in 1901, at that time an unprecedented sum for a federally funded monument. The following year, the three-member Grant Memorial Commission selected New York sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady from a field of 27 candidates, most with far more experience in the realm of public sculpture.
The memorial would become his life's work. He spent 20 years on it and died at the age of 52, just weeks before its dedication in 1922. But if you're going to leave only one masterwork, you could do a lot worse than this one. The visitor who takes the trouble to seek it out is rewarded for the effort.


Woman Takes Rare Lead Role at Mormon Event
For the first time anyone can remember, the person leading millions of Mormon faithful in a prayer at an important church conference Saturday was a woman.
Sister Jean A. Stevens offered a benediction at the Mormon church's semiannual General Conference in Salt Lake City, a two-day meeting of sermons broadcast to Mormons around the world. The move coincides with increasingly vocal demands by some members of the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the U.S. for greater gender equality, particularly in leadership positions.
Women routinely speak at the General Conference, but hadn't led prayer, according to existing records and church historians. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins said he couldn't confirm it was the first time a woman had prayed but said he couldn't point to a specific other time. "It's certainly the first time in a long time," he said. Prayers at the conference aren't scripted and aren't political statements, he said.
In her prayer before a crowd of 21,000 at the church's downtown Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Ms. Stevens didn't address gender equality directly in her prayer. But she did give thanks for the "blessings of priesthood power."
Ms. Stevens holds the title of First Counselor in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Primary General Presidency, a group that oversees the church's programs for children. Church spokeswoman Jessica Moody said Ms. Stevens wasn't available to comment.


Chicago Mayor's Pension Conundrum
CHICAGO—Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who built a reputation in Washington as a blunt problem solver, is grappling with one of the nation's biggest municipal-pension shortfalls, setting up a showdown with labor unions as he stakes his first term on reshaping city government.
The former chief of staff to President Barack Obama inherited a retirement system for teachers, firefighters and other city workers that is underfunded by almost $24 billion—and the bills are starting to come due.
Under Illinois law, the city schools in coming months must resume regular payments to the teachers retirement system at a cost of $404 million a year, or nearly 8% of current Chicago education spending. Mr. Emanuel also faces a state mandate to more than double payments to the pension funds for police, firefighters and other unions.
If these payments were funded by property taxes, his administration estimates residents would face a 150% increase—an option Mr. Emanuel says he won't consider.
His other options also are tough. Mr. Emanuel could try to reach agreements on benefits cuts with individual unions, though such efforts so far have fallen flat. Or he could bypass unions by persuading the Illinois legislature to trim pension benefits for city employees and current retirees or give the city the power to do it.


Charity Ex-Chief Sentenced
The former executive director of a Brooklyn nonprofit group founded by Assemblyman Vito Lopez was sentenced to one year of probation and was fined $2,500 on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court.
Christiana Fisher pleaded guilty in November to one charge of criminal contempt for lying to federal investigators about a large pay raise she received as chief of the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council. Her salary jumped to $659,591 a year from $235,135, according to court records.
"I know I've made mistakes," Ms. Fisher said in court before being sentenced by U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV. "I've lost my livelihood."
"I don't ask your honor to sanction what I've done," she added, "but I ask you to view these events in the context of my whole life and the work I have done and to give me the opportunity to continue my life's calling and helping others."
Ms. Fisher was charged in a federal investigation that started after the city's Department of Investigation referred findings of its own probe in 2010. The city DOI accused Ridgewood Bushwick of submitting expense reports for government funding that were riddled with errors. The group has a $120 million budget and provides social services to a swath of Brooklyn and Queens.


Bird-Flu Case Reported in Beijing
BEIJING—Chinese authorities said a girl in the northern Chinese capital of Beijing had tested positive for a deadly new form of avian flu, in the first reported case outside the region surrounding the eastern city of Shanghai.
Beijing's health bureau said on Saturday that a 7-year-old girl surnamed Yao tested positive for the H7N9 bird flu. The girl is in stable condition at a local hospital, it said. Officials said her parents are poultry sellers and live in Beijing's Shunyi district.
Authorities said her parents don't appear to have the disease. Experts both inside and outside of China say the disease doesn't appear to be contagious from person to person, which would make it considerably more dangerous.
The Beijing infection increases the total number of known cases in China to 44, of which 11 have died. On Friday authorities reported five new cases. Until Saturday the cases have been in Shanghai or in the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui, on China's eastern coastal region. Many of the reported cases have involved people in close contact with birds.
Since March 31, when the first infections were reported, local officials in the region have closed live poultry markets and culled birds in a number of places. National authorities have also revved up their response.


Liu Aide, Backer Stand Trial
A longtime political supporter and the campaign treasurer for city Comptroller John Liu "tried to corrupt an election here in New York City," a federal prosecutor charged Tuesday in opening statements at the pair's fundraising-fraud trial in Manhattan federal court.
But lawyers for Xing Wu "Oliver" Pan, 47 years old, and Mr. Liu's former campaign treasurer, Jia "Jenny" Hou, 26, offered the jury alternative narratives in the conspiracy case. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty. Mr. Liu hasn't been charged in the investigation, which dates to 2009.
Opening remarks by attorneys focused on the crux of the case—the concept of straw donors, a technique to shield campaign donors who want to exceed campaign-contribution limits. Mr. Pan and Ms. Hou are accused of operating such a scheme, under which operatives secure a big donation, then hide it by recruiting so-called straw donors, who each contribute smaller sums—only to be reimbursed with the money from the big donor.
Gerald Lefcourt, attorney for Ms. Hou, told the jury "you won't hear any evidence" that his client had knowledge of an Aug. 17, 2011, fundraiser where prosecutors alleged she and Mr. Pan conspired to raise campaign money through straw donors. "Ladies and gentlemen, Jenny Hou is not guilty and the evidence will show that she is not guilty."
Mr. Pan's attorney, Irwin Rochman, said there was no debate Mr. Pan took part in obtaining straw donors for that event. "This case is not about whether," he said. "It's about why."


Small Town's Grim Day
WEST, Texas—This small town just off I-35, known in central Texas as a good place to pull off the highway for Czech pastries, spent Thursday coming to grips with a landscape of flattened homes and diminishing hopes that friends and neighbors will be found alive in the aftermath of a devastating explosion.
The blast Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant here has left more than a dozen dead, and 150 injured. It destroyed a school and 75 or so homes—damaging a sizable portion of a tightknit town of 2,800 with a Czech heritage that stretches back generations.
The majority of the dead are believed to be first responders, who had raced to the scene to try to tame a fire at the plant, not knowing the mammoth blast was coming. The explosion had the force of a 2.1 magnitude earthquake, seismologists said.
Law-enforcement officials are still sifting through the rubble in search of survivors, but none are expected, said Tommy Muska, the town's mayor. Mr. Muska, who lost his own home on Wednesday, is a volunteer firefighter himself—as well as an insurance agent in town.
"Our town is definitely hurting," he said. His office was flooded with insurance claims.


Miranda Laws Have Flexibility
A federal law-enforcement official said Friday that authorities would take Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev into custody without reading him his right to remain silent, in order to question him about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence.
Such a move is part of an exception to Miranda laws that officers can use when there is a concern for public safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation considers the exception to Miranda rules to be a "powerful tool with a modern application for law enforcement," wrote Carl Benoit, a legal instructor at the FBI Academy, in a law-enforcement bulletin.
The Obama administration set new emergency rules in 2011 for Miranda rights, allowing for extended questioning of suspects before they are read their right to remain silent. The move was intended to blunt criticism from Republicans that a valuable intelligence-gathering opportunity might be lost if suspects were allowed access to lawyers quickly.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Friday took to Twitter, before Mr. Tsarnaev was captured alive, to urge the administration to detain a Boston suspect as an enemy combatant for intelligence-gathering purposes. "The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to 'remain silent,' " said a post on Mr. Graham's Twitter account.
A spokesman for Mr. Graham didn't respond to a request for comment.


Russia Distances Itself From Suspects
MOSCOW—A Russian intelligence official told the Interfax news agency that Russian security services couldn't have provided meaningful operational information to the U.S. about Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhkokhar Tsarnaev because the brothers didn't reside in Russia.
"Seeing as the Tsarnaev brothers didn't reside in Russia, our security services couldn't have provided meaningful operational information to our foreign partners," Interfax quoted a "source in the Russian security services" as saying Saturday.
A spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service declined to confirm the statement made to Interfax when contacted Saturday. He said to call back on Monday when the agency should have more information.
Since a high-profile manhunt in Boston shined the spotlight on the two bombing suspects, Russia has started distancing itself from the Tsarnaev brothers, whose parents are currently in Dagestan, a republic in the south of Russia that borders Chechnya.
"Their presence in Russia is minimal," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Wall Street Journal on Saturday morning. Ramzan Kadyrov, the current President of Republic of Chechnya in southern Russia, decried "any attempt" to connect the brothers with Chechnya in a statement Friday night. "They grew up in the United States. Their attitudes and beliefs were formed there. One must look for the root of the evil in America," Mr. Kadyrov said. The Federal Security Service spokesman on Saturday immediately pointed out that one of the alleged bombers was a U.S. citizen.


Bomb Victims Make Recovery Progress
Some victims of the Boston bombing began to reach the first milestones of their recoveries this week but faced a long, sometimes uncertain path forward.
Sydney Corcoran took her first steps since the bombing with help from a walker earlier this week, her uncle, Tim Corcoran, said Tuesday. On Monday, she began to walk with crutches, he said, after several surgeries to repair a major artery in her leg that was severed in the bomb blasts.
Physical therapy would come next, but it wasn't clear when Ms. Corcoran, age 18, would begin, Mr. Corcoran said. "There's no word on that. We're still in the healing process," he said.
For Sydney's mother, Celeste Corcoran, age 47, the road is even longer. The elder Ms. Corcoran lost both legs to the explosions, and mother and daughter were separated during the chaos. Though it is unclear when his sister-in-law will be able to leave the hospital, her sense of humor is returning and she has joked a bit with visitors, he said.
A total of 264 people were injured in the bombing, according to updated figures from the Boston Public Health Commission. Many of the hospitalized patients have been discharged, but 44 remain hospitalized, with two in critical condition.


Habit of Restraint on Display on Catalonia Vote
Spain's economic crisis has confronted Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy with an old grievance in Catalonia: a conviction that the relatively wealthy northern region contributes too much to national coffers.
Catalonia plans a referendum next year asking its voters whether the region should declare independence from Spain.
Many Spanish politicians view this as a grave threat to the constitutional order stitched together after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. Some supporters of Mr. Rajoy have urged him to act aggressively against the Catalan leadership.
Yet, it was precisely Mr. Rajoy's habit of restraint, said former Prime Minister Jose María Aznar in a memoir, that made Mr. Aznar want Mr. Rajoy to succeed him as head of Spain's conservative Popular Party.
The idea was that Mr. Rajoy's natural caution would help him in dealing with restive regions. Aides say he understands how an ill-chosen word from Madrid can inflame regional tensions, partly because his native Galicia, like Catalonia, has its own language and cultural identity.


Queens Man Is Sentenced in Terror Case
A Queens man who a prosecutor said was the "less active participant" in a two-man terrorism plot in 2011 to attack synagogues was sentenced to five years in prison on Friday.
Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus sentenced Mohamed Mamdouh to five years for conspiracy as an act of terrorism and two other weapons charges. That sentence will run concurrently with a 31⁄2-year sentence that the 22-year-old is already serving for an unrelated burglary, the judge said.
Appearing in court in an untucked, white dress shirt and dark pants, Mr. Mamdouh, a U.S. citizen of Moroccan descent, declined to make a statement before his sentencing. His attorney, Aaron Mysliwiec, told the judge Mr. Mamdouh feels "genuine remorse" for his actions. The attorney told the judge that through his dealings with Mr. Mamdouh he's come to know him as "a man who doesn't have hatred in his heart" for other "religions, races or creeds."
He pleaded guilty in February 2012, court records show, but that pleading wasn't made public until Friday. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on why the guilty plea wasn't previously disclosed. Mr. Mysliwiec declined to comment on when his client pleaded guilty or whether Mr. Mamdouh cooperated with the investigation.
Prosecutor Gary Galperin told the judge his office acknowledges that Mr. Mamdouh was "without a doubt a less active participant in the crimes."


FEMA to Release More Cash
Six months after superstorm Sandy, hundreds of millions in additional dollars in federal storm-recovery funds soon could be flowing toward the region's battered coastal communities.
A $267 million grant announced last weekend to the Long Island Power Authority was set to nudge the Federal Emergency Management Agency's spending past $2.5 billion in New York state.
That sum equates to $131 for every person in New York, the funding ratio that is expected to trigger a richer reimbursement rate by FEMA. The agency now can increase its reimbursement to towns and agencies from 75% to 90% of storm-damage costs—with the rest paid by local governments.
The paperwork for the LIPA grant should be completed by Wednesday, a FEMA official said.
"Everyone at these meetings with town leaders asks me that question. It's the one question I get every time. This large LIPA grant should throw us over," said Mike Byrne, FEMA's top-recovery official in New York. "And I think it's going to make a big difference."


U.S. Aims to Fix Rift Among Mideast Allies
WASHINGTON—Divisions among the U.S.'s closest Arab and Muslim allies are imperiling the Obama administration's efforts to forge unified responses to crises in the Middle East, including Syria's civil war and Egypt's economic turmoil.
Administration officials have intensified efforts to bridge the differences as it gropes for answers on hot spots and tries to muster support for renewed Arab-Israeli peace talks. As part of that effort, Secretary of State John Kerry met with leaders of the Arab League on Monday, a week after President Barack Obama met with the rulers of Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, U.S. officials said.
The regional divisions, described by senior U.S., European and Arab officials, are driven by religious, political and economic rivalries that have been exacerbated by the revolutions and rebellions that have swept across the Mideast and North Africa since early 2011.
"There is no coherent Arab coalition," a senior U.S. official said Monday, adding that the divisions now could spur a power struggle in the future.
In one camp, said the officials, are Qatar and Turkey, whose leaders are supportive of a political Islam that is gaining hold in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia and Libya. Qatar and Turkey have shown particular support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement whose politicians now dominate the governments in Cairo and Tunis and are active in Syria's opposition.


Bishop Plays Key Role in New Jersey Politics
NEWARK, N.J.—Bishop Reginald Jackson is no stranger to politics, having endorsed New Jersey candidates for decades and recently winning election to one of the top positions in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
But whom to endorse for governor this fall has presented a dilemma for the former pastor in Orange who is arguably one of the most influential African-Americans in New Jersey.
Bishop Jackson supports some of Republican Gov. Chris Christie's views on education, and Mr. Christie is known to call him for policy advice. But as a lifelong Democrat with ties to the national party, Bishop Jackson says he not only admires the presumptive Democratic nominee for governor—Sen. Barbara Buono—he counts her as an old friend.
"I am Democrat with an open mind," said Bishop Jackson, 59 years old, during an interview in his office last week. He endorsed Democrat Jon Corzine in the last governor's race. "Most times I'll support the Democrat, but if there's a race where I think the Republican is the better candidate, then I'm going to endorse the better candidate."
Bishop Jackson has pledged not to hand down an endorsement until after the June primary, injecting drama into what otherwise has so far been a low-key contest for governor. Mr. Christie leads Ms. Buono by 30 points in several recent polls and has raised five times the amount of money, according to the campaigns.


Security Tight for Bikers Through New York's Five Boroughs
Amid heavy security Sunday, a popular annual bike race—one of the first large-scale public events since the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon—rolled through New York City without major incident.
The "Five Boro Bike Tour," which brought up to 32,000 cyclists out onto the city's streets, posed a significant security challenge for authorities on heightened alert after last month's attack.
The biking event began in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood early Sunday and ended in Staten Island. The New York Police Department confirmed Sunday evening there were no alerts or arrests in connection with the event, which dates back to 1977.
The grueling 40-mile cycle did claim one victim; a 51-year-old Michigan man died from a heart attack while pedaling across the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, officials said.
Security was noticeably increased for this year's tour, with police officers posted along the route and a helicopter flying overhead. Authorities also set up manned checkpoints at the circuit's five bridge crossings, and cyclists reported police checking their jerseys for entry numbers.


Hezbollah Steps Up in Syria; Israel Eases Tone
Hezbollah fighters joined Syrian government forces in the siege of a rebel-held town inside the war-torn country on Monday, local residents said, deepening the Iran-backed group's involvement in Syria's civil war and raising alarm among U.S. officials.
Israel tried to tamp down tensions in the region, meanwhile, one day after it launched its second recent attack on arms shipments inside Syria that intelligence experts say were Hezbollah-bound Iranian missiles.
The latest phase of Syria's conflict raises fresh U.S. concerns about Hezbollah, a Tehran-backed group that is a member of Lebanon's governing partnership and is deemed by the U.S. to be a terrorist organization. U.S. officials have seen units of Hezbollah fighters emerging in different parts of Syria with numbers ranging from 2,000 to 2,500 fighters, a U.S. official said.
"These folks will turn up trained and battle-hardened," the official said.
This development has changed the calculations of U.S. intelligence and diplomatic officials who are trying to gauge how long Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will remain in power. This development bolsters Mr. Assad "in a huge way," said the U.S. official, and it makes the Syrian opposition fighters less effective.


Candidate for Mayor Apologizes for Comment About Port Authority Police
Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota apologized Wednesday for calling Port Authority police officers "nothing more than mall cops" at a candidates forum Tuesday evening.
The apology comes a few months after Mr. Lhota, then chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, apologized to Mayor Michael Bloomberg for referring to him as an "idiot." And that came a few weeks after Mr. Lhota apologized for a heated exchange in which he urged an authority board member to "be a man." That apology came a few months after Mr. Lhota apologized to a state senator whom he had accused of talking a lot about fighting rats in the subway, but taking no action.
So it has gone for Mr. Lhota as he has entered two high-profile roles in the past two years after spending decades behind the scenes. He has a pattern of saying impolitic things in public that lead to a backlash and an apology later.
On Tuesday, Mr. Lhota sounded as if he knew as he was speaking that what he was about to say was politically unwise.
"I don't think the Port Authority does a good enough job in anything that they do, quite honestly, but clearly in the area of security," Mr. Lhota said. "Those cops get paid more than NYPD cops, and quite honestly—I know I'm going to get into trouble for saying this—they're nothing more than mall cops."


Cramped Space, Heaping Dishes
By 10 a.m., crowds are already gathering outside La Isla, a sliver of a restaurant that belies the creative Cuban-inflected cuisine inside.
Savvy diners know to look past the dingy walls, harsh lighting and narrow strip of tables (party limit: four people) and to focus on something more important—the food plates. Order towering French toast dipped in a cinnamon egg batter, coated with corn flakes and almonds and stuffed with a sweet, oozing blend of guava, strawberries and cream cheese ($10). Those seeking savory dishes should try La Papa—a crispy, breaded ball of mashed potato filled with ground meat and topped with bacon, two fried eggs, salsa and swiss cheese ($8). Order it all with a side of sweet fried plantains ($4.50) and ask your waiter to blend the creamy, iced latte ($3) to create a Cuban Frappuccino.
Chef and co-owner Omar Giner said he is in the process of overhauling the menu to include more vegetarian and possibly gluten-free items. He is also exploring a new, more spacious location in uptown Hoboken.
Regardless of any changes, every dish will retain a Latin theme, because: "I don't want to be just like everybody else," he said. "You've got to have something a little different. That's why people come to you."

Gunfire Kills Girl Riding Bus in Queens
A 14-year-old girl who had just boarded a New York City bus following a Sweet 16 party was fatally shot during a barrage of gunshots Saturday night, police said.
Police said they were searching for a young man on Sunday who they believe fired the shot that killed Daja Robinson on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Q6 bus at Sutphin and Rockaway boulevards in the South Jamaica neighborhood of Queens.
It wasn't clear what motivated the shooting, but there is "certainly a possibility of some gang involvement here," New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Sunday. He said Daja wasn't the target of the shooting, but instead the victim of "another senseless murder."
"The events are being aggressively investigated," Mr. Kelly said.
"It's just absolutely terrible," Mr. Kelly added. "This is, as I say, another senseless shooting. This young girl should be having the time of her life. She went to a party. It was a happy affair. There were no problems at the party, inside the lounge, to the best of our knowledge at this time."


Twin Bomb Attacks Kill 20 in Niger
Suicide bombers killed 20 people in separate attacks on a military base and a uranium-mining site in Niger on Thursday, and government officials said the twin strikes were likely the work of a militant group from Mali that may have re-established itself in Libya.
The attacks underline the risk that multiple Islamist insurgencies in the Sahara could spill into previously peaceful Niger.
French nuclear-engineering company Areva SA said its uranium mine in Arlit, about 100 miles north of Agadez, was also attacked by a car bomb early Thursday, leaving one of its employees dead and wounding 14 others.
The U.S. military has been considering Agadez as a possible base to fly the surveillance drones it deployed to Niger this year as part of a broader international effort to search for and fight al Qaeda and other Islamist guerrillas in North and West Africa.


After Murder Suspect's Death, Probe Is Decried, Defended
WALTHAM, Mass.—A state prosecutor probing an unsolved 2011 triple homicide defended the investigation on Thursday after federal officials said they believe Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev helped carry out the murders.
Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan, who was appointed to the post last month, said the case is still open and active. "This office and its law-enforcement partners have conducted a thorough, far-reaching investigation beginning in 2011 when this horrific crime occurred," Ms. Ryan said. "This investigation has not concluded and is by no means closed."
She released the statement a day after two U.S. officials said that investigators believe Mr. Tsarnaev participated in the September 2011 murder of three men who were found in an apartment outside Boston with their throats slit. Ms. Ryan said she was legally barred from speaking more specifically about the case.
Mr. Tsarnaev's possible involvement in the murders raises a delicate issue for local law enforcement: It would represent a missed opportunity to apprehend him before the April 15 bombing at the Boston Marathon that left another three people dead and more than 260 injured. Authorities believe Mr. Tsarnaev, who died at age 26 after an April 19 shootout with law enforcement, carried out the attack with his younger brother Dzhokhar, who is being held in a prison hospital.
Dzhokhar, 19 years old, has been charged but hasn't entered a plea. Authorities also believe the brothers killed a campus police officer in Cambridge, Mass., after the bombing, but charges haven't been filed in that case.


City Official for Homeless Services Gets State Job
The commissioner of New York City's Department of Homeless Services, an agency that has been the target of intense criticism, is leaving his post to join Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration, a shakeup that comes seven months before a new mayor takes over City Hall.
The governor on Tuesday appointed Seth Diamond, head of the city's homeless services agency since 2010, to serve as director of storm recovery. In that role, he will oversee the state's storm recovery initiatives for Sandy, Irene and Lee, including programs for housing, business, transportation and coastal and inland infrastructure, the state said in a news release.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed Michele Ovesey, legal counsel to the Department of Homeless Services, to replace Mr. Diamond.
Critics say one of the greatest failures of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure is his administration's approach to homelessness. This year, more than 50,000 people were sleeping in city homeless shelters, an all-time high and a 61% rise since Mr. Bloomberg became mayor in 2002.
Earlier this spring, the department reported a 13% increase in the number of homeless sleeping on city subways, prompting the administration to outline a new plan to combat the problem. Overall, the city estimated there were 3,180 unsheltered homeless people in January, a slight decline of 82 people from 2012.


Thompson, Quinn Recycle Trash Fight
Two heavyweights in the race for mayor, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and former Comptroller Bill Thompson, are having their first major campaign clash over what seems like a neighborhood issue: the construction of a garbage-transfer station on the Upper East Side.
The disagreement between the two Democrats has exposed the subtexts of race and class that lurk beneath the vexing problem of where, in a crowded city, to put undesirable facilities.
The transfer station has been a flash point in Manhattan politics since Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed reopening a dormant site over a decade ago as part of an overhaul of the city's trash-removal system, which had relied largely on trucks and facilities concentrated in low-income neighborhoods in boroughs outside Manhattan.
The plan, approved in 2006 by the City Council under Ms. Quinn's leadership, called for spreading trash facilities throughout the city and replacing trucks with barges and trains to reduce traffic and pollution.
Mr. Thompson, who is black, came out against building the facility Thursday morning. He joined neighborhood politicians and some of his rivals in the mayoral race who oppose the station—under construction on the east end of 91st Street—because they say it would be overly burdensome for the area.


City Seeking to Attract Gay, Lesbian Foster Parents
New York City is launching a campaign to recruit gay and lesbian foster parents, part of a major push to expand the kinds of families who consider fostering and to find more welcoming homes for children who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer.
The public ad campaign, set to roll out this week, features images of an interracial gay couple spending time with a young child. "Be the reason she has hope," one of the ads reads. In another, a black woman is pictured alone with a white teenage boy. "Be the reason it gets better," the message says.
How many of the nearly 13,000 children in New York City's foster-care system identify as LGBTQ is unclear because the city does not keep such data. But, citing anecdotal evidence, researchers, child advocates and city officials insist that the children are disproportionately represented in the foster care system and say the need to find them supportive homes is great.
"When we decided to do this campaign we knew that LGBTQ young people are disproportionately represented in our foster care population, especially among our teens," said Ronald Richter, commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, the city's child welfare agency.
Mr. Richter, citing a study the city commissioned last year, said the data show that adults who identify as LGBTQ are more likely to want to foster a child who may also identify that way.


Diplomats Hit by Accusations
WASHINGTON—The U.S. ambassador to Belgium denied published reports about a memo that alleged he had solicited prostitutes, one of a series of accusations involving the State Department.
Ambassador Howard Gutman, a political appointee, issued his statement Tuesday, a day after a CBS News report cited what it said was an internal 2012 memo from the State Department's Office of Inspector General that outlined a string of abuses allegedly committed by U.S. personnel overseas.
Included in the memo were allegations that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail hired prostitutes and engaged in other improper activities while on diplomatic missions, and that senior State Department officials sought to stop probes of the allegations, according to the CBS report.
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki denied reports that State Department officials tried to stop any investigations. She said the inspector general was continuing to investigate the various accusations and has brought in law-enforcement officials to aid in the probe.
"All cases mentioned in the CBS report were thoroughly investigated or under investigation, and the department continues to take action," she said.


Legislator Seeks to Fix New York State's Divorce Laws
Just three years after New York passed sweeping changes to its matrimonial laws, a legislator has proposed an overhaul of its alimony guidelines, including setting new formulas to determine the length and amount of post-divorce awards. The legislation would also abolish an unusual legal precedent that treats professional degrees as marital assets.
The changes came in response to a report from an independent commission last month that recommended sweeping changes after a nearly three-year study. Not all of the report's recommendations were incorporated into the new bill, prompting criticism from divorce lawyers who worried it would be rushed through before the legislative session ends on June 20.
"We're really just trying to accommodate a lot of interests in a very quick fashion," said Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, a Westchester Democrat. "I think everybody's very pleased with the direction that we're going."
Not everyone agreed.
"We believe this bill should be rejected," said Michael Stutman, president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. The chapter's board of managers held a unanimous vote to oppose the bill and would be urging members to protest, he said.


Former Assemblyman Lopez Faces Ethics Fine
The New York state Legislative Ethics Commission fined former Assemblyman Vito Lopez $330,000 after finding that he violated three provisions of the state's public officers law.
Mr. Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat, is accused of having sexually harassed several female staffers, and in May the state ethics commission, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, found that he violated state law by doing so, and referred its findings to the Legislative Ethics Commission.
In a report issued Tuesday, that commission concluded that by "making numerous inappropriate actions and offensive comments of a sexual nature with certain legislative staff members under his supervision and professional employment" and by "subjecting certain female legislative staff members..to unwanted physical contact," among other actions, Mr. Lopez had indeed violated three provisions of the state's public officers law.
The commission also said that it found at least 33 violations of one provision of the state's public officer's law against at least four of the staffers.
Mr. Lopez has denied wrongdoing and said he resigned from office in order to pursue a seat on the New York City Council.


Firefighters Gain Ground in Colorado
DENVER—A wildfire that killed two people, burned more than 400 homes and forced thousands to evacuate near Colorado Springs was 55% contained late Saturday, allowing emergency officials to begin shifting attention to assessing its toll.
The Black Forest Fire, which has charred more than 15,000 acres outside Colorado Springs, didn't destroy any additional ground or homes overnight and firefighters were able to substantially improve upon the prior estimate of 30% containment, officials said at a noon briefing local time.
El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said the number of people assigned to assess damage to homes—an issue of great concern to evacuated residents—had been increased from 12 to 20 in an acknowledgment that firefighters were gaining the upper hand.
Incident commander Rich Harvey said at an evening news conference that containment of the fire was at 55 percent, up from 45 percent earlier Saturday.
While no additional homes were destroyed, the assessments led to a higher updated tally for previous damage: 473 homes ruined, making it the most destructive fire in Colorado's history.


Democrat Jeff Klein Under Microscope
ALBANY—As the legislative session winds down, all eyes in the Capitol are on Jeff Klein, a state senator from the Bronx who is seen as wielding tremendous power over Gov. Andrew Cuomo's agenda.
Mr. Klein leads the Independent Democratic Conference, which broke away from the Democrats—who hold a majority of seats in the Senate—to share power with Republicans. In the final few weeks of the session, his first as a legislative leader, Mr. Klein has found himself in the cross hairs of Mr. Cuomo, advocacy groups and lobbyists, who have targeted him as the key to whether legislation such as Mr. Cuomo's drive to amend abortion rights in New York or introduce a system of public financing for elections can find a way to a vote.
In recent days, a coalition of women's groups pushing Mr. Cuomo's Women's Equality Act, which includes provisions concerning abortion, began airing a commercial in Mr. Klein's district. "Sen. Jeff Klein made a promise to New York women," the ad says. "Klein promised to support our right to choose. Now Klein is blocking a vote on the Women's Equality Act."
On Monday, Mr. Cuomo, who has called for Mr. Klein to force votes on the issues even if they are bound to fail, went a step further, warning in a radio interview that "campaign finance—public finance—and the choice issue are going to be significant election-day issues next year."
Of the abortion issue, Mr. Cuomo said, "The big question is going to be for the IDC," describing the conference members in an aggressive dig as "theoretically" Democrats. "How do you let them not take a vote?"


WikiLeaks Reasserts Itself by Helping Leaker
Since publishing an explosive series of classified U.S. documents in 2010, WikiLeaks' fortunes have faltered. But the anti-secrecy group roared back to prominence on Sunday by helping NSA leaker Edward Snowden try to evade U.S. prosecution.
As Mr. Snowden unexpectedly flew out of Hong Kong, WikiLeaks said it was helping him seek asylum in Ecuador—the same Latin American country that threw WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a lifeline last year as he was trying to avoid extradition to Sweden from the U.K. for questioning in a sexual-assault case.
Ecuador's decision to grant Mr. Assange political asylum and a place to live at its London embassy for the past year has created friction among the countries involved. But the WikiLeaks-Ecuador connection could potentially spark a much larger political incident if Mr. Snowden is granted asylum.
In a series of statements on Sunday, WikiLeaks said Mr. Snowden had asked the group for assistance. "Mr. Snowden requested that WikiLeaks use its legal expertise and experience to secure his safety," the group said, adding that WikiLeaks "legal advisers" were escorting Mr. Snowden in his travels.
The news of the apparent involvement marked a comeback of sorts for WikiLeaks, which has suffered setbacks in recent years. Mr. Assange's confinement to the Ecuadoran Embassy in London has largely deprived the group of its founder, although Mr. Assange has said he is still able to work from inside the embassy. WikiLeaks has also complained that a U.S. effort to block funding to the group has left it without much cash. And WikiLeaks has suffered from the departure of several associates who quarreled with Mr. Assange.


One Women's Rights Bill Does Pass in Albany
ALBANY—While Gov. Andrew Cuomo's women's rights agenda failed to pass the state Legislature last week, lawmakers managed to rescue a single piece: a bill that would extend to 17 from 15 the age at which judges can offer counseling instead of jail time to minors facing prostitution charges.
The bill, initially part of anti-sex trafficking legislation included in the failed Women's Equality Act, was introduced in the Assembly as a separate bill Tuesday, when it became clear that the 10 planks in the women's agenda were likely dead.
Late Friday night, the provision passed both legislative chambers and supporters expect it to be signed into law by Mr. Cuomo, making it the only piece of the women's rights agenda to succeed in Albany so far this year.
Advocates called the legislation, which expands a 2008 Safe Harbor provision allowing judges to offer services to juveniles instead of prosecuting them, a victory that would treat those arrested for prostitution as victims.
It also gives 16- and 17-year-olds charged with prostitution youthful-offender status, allowing their records to be sealed after their 18th birthdays.


DOMA decision prompts new moves in New Jersey
Lawyers in a New Jersey same-sex marriage case said Wednesday that they intend to make a new court filing after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that strikes down a federal ban on recognizing gay unions.
In the hours after the Supreme Court's ruling that invalidated parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, advocates for gay rights were sorting out the details of their legal and political approach in New Jersey, one of seven states that offers gay couples the legal protection of marriage but does not recognize their nuptials. Lambda Legal lawyer Hayley Gorenberg said she planned have a conference call Wednesday with a judge and lawyers for the state government to discuss the next filing. It was not clear exactly when or where the filing will be made, she said.
Len Deo, president of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, which opposes gay marriage, said he believes that under Wednesday's court ruling, New Jersey couples with civil unions could receive those federal benefits. That interpretation is different from what most gay rights groups say the ruling says.
"It gives the states jurisdiction to decide what marriage is," Deo said. "New Jersey's choice has been civil unions and it matters not what the other states have done."
Lawmakers in New Jersey last year passed a law to allow gay marriage, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed it.

Potential TB Drug Shortfall Poses Risks
MUMBAI—India faces a potential shortage of a critical medication for drug-resistant tuberculosis that could deepen an already acute drug- shortfall-problem in the country with the highest burden of the deadly contagious disease.
Tuberculosis officials in several Indian states said this week that their stocks of kanamycin, an injectable antibiotic commonly used to treat drug-resistant TB, are running low, and an Indian government official acknowledged that the country has only a three-month supply left.
The potential shortage would be the latest of several that India is facing with its TB drugs, and is particularly worrying because sporadic supplies of medications for drug-resistant forms of the disease can actually fuel further drug resistance. If a patient who is ill with TB starts and then stops taking a TB drug, even if it isn't for long, the bacteria that cause it can quickly become resistant to it. Patients can also die waiting for drugs, according to TB experts.
India initially asked the Global Drug Facility, a TB drug procurement organization in Geneva, for an emergency supply of about 400,000 vials of the antibiotic, officials from both the Indian government and the Stop TB Partnership, which oversees the GDF, confirmed. Then the government failed to sign tax exemption and port clearance documents to allow importation of the shipment from its manufacturer in Japan.
Niraj Kulshrestha, a senior official at the country's Central TB Division, said he didn't know why the documents weren't signed. He said the government now will resolve the shortage "by making emergency purchases" locally. "By the first week of July we will get the drugs," he said.


Abortion-Drug Case on Docket for Now
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday expressed interest in examining an Oklahoma law restricting the use of abortion-inducing drugs, raising the prospect of a ruling on an increasingly prevalent form of abortion.
The high court hasn't previously considered what kind of rules on drug-induced abortions might pass constitutional scrutiny. In the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and subsequent decisions modifying it, the Supreme Court has said women have a right to an abortion, while upholding certain state restrictions, such as waiting-period requirements.
The justices announced in a short written order that they would review the Oklahoma case, but added an asterisk: Before the court would move forward, it wished to hear the Oklahoma Supreme Court's views on how the state's law works. That left open the possibility that the high court could delay action or drop the case altogether after the Oklahoma court responds.
The appeal before the Supreme Court centers largely on RU-486, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 for use in terminating pregnancies.
Abortion-rights supporters say the drug and others like it expand women's access to abortion, because they are cheaper and less invasive than surgical abortions, can be taken privately and can be made available in areas where there are few or no abortion providers.


Mayor Says Whites Stopped 'Too Much'
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday he believes the New York Police Department stops white people too much and nonwhite people too little based on murder suspect descriptions.
His comments sparked outrage one day after the City Council overwhelmingly approved bills aimed at cracking down on the controversial stop-and-frisk tactic.
"One newspaper and one news service, they just keep saying, 'Oh, it's a disproportionate percentage of a particular ethnic group.' That may be. But it's not a disproportionate percentage of those who witnesses and victims describe as committing the murders," said Mr. Bloomberg, speaking on his weekly radio show about the large percentage of blacks and Latinos who are stopped by police in the five boroughs each year.
"In that case, incidentally, I think, we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little," the mayor said. "It's exactly the reverse of what they're saying. I don't know where they went to school, but they certainly didn't take a math course, or a logic course."
Mr. Bloomberg said flatly on Friday: "Nobody racially profiles."


Term-Limits Decision Taking a Toll on Christine Quinn in Mayor's Race
It has been almost five years since City Council Speaker Christine Quinn helped change a city law so Mayor Michael Bloomberg could run for a third term in office, but many voters are still holding it against her.
Now that Ms. Quinn is in the thick of her own campaign for mayor, the lingering anger over that move has been stoked by her opponents and has already put some Democratic primary voters out of her reach.
In more than two dozen interviews last week with registered Democrats who participated in a Wall Street Journal/NBC 4 New York/Marist College poll that showed Ms. Quinn dropping to second place in the primary field, many volunteered that her handling of the term-limits issue led them to rule her out.
"I'm not voting for Quinn because I voted for term limits and they repealed them," volunteered Robert Shells, a 65-year-old hospital chef who lives in upper Manhattan, when asked why he was considering voting for former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former city Comptroller Bill Thompson but not Ms. Quinn. "It's going to come back to haunt her."
Voters across boroughs and demographic divides said that even if they didn't have strong opinions about term limits themselves, they were upset that elected officials had undone the will of the public. New Yorkers approved a two-term limit in 1993 and rejected a proposal to extend the limit to three terms in 1996.


Kerry Cites Progress in Mideast Talks
TEL AVIV—U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry concluded four days of intense negotiations with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Sunday without a deal to resume face-to-face peace talks, but he cited steps forward.
"We have made real progress on this trip," Mr. Kerry told reporters at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport before wrapping up his fifth visit to the region since taking office. "I believe that with a little more work, the start of final-status negotiations could be within reach."
Mr. Kerry is leaving aides behind in the region to continue mediating a resumption of direct peace talks, which have been stalled since 2010 over disputes about construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
But Palestinian and Israeli leaders sounded a more cautious note Sunday. Palestinian veteran chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters that Mr. Kerry's meetings with President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah had been "positive and profound," but that "there had been no breakthrough so far that would allow for a renewal of negotiations."
"There is still a gap between the Palestinian and Israeli positions," Mr. Erekat said.


Immigration Overhaul Will Pass, Treasury Secretary Says
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew predicted Sunday evening that Congress would eventually pass an immigration overhaul, rejecting the common view in Washington that differences between House and Senate lawmakers may be too great to overcome.
"We have to do it because it's the right thing to do," he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. "We have to do it because it's the smart thing to do."
Mr. Lew declined to predict what the final immigration package would look like. He said any final deal would have to be something that the Senate and White House officials agreed to, suggesting an openness to future negotiations.
The Senate passed an immigration overhaul bill last week that was backed by all the chamber's Democrats and some Republicans. House Republicans said the bill wouldn't pass the House, but they are discussing how to proceed.
Mr. Lew touched on a number of domestic and foreign issues in his Aspen appearance.


Coney Island's Astrotower Is Dismantled
Authorities re-opened most of Coney Island's Luna Park on Thursday after construction crews worked feverishly to dismantle a section of a 236-foot-tall former observation tower that had been teetering dangerously for days.
The emergency work involved two large cranes and dozens of workers, who removed 53 feet from the top of the tower down, authorities said. Police on Tuesday night had cordoned off a three-block area near the tower, including two of the park's most popular rides, the Cyclone roller coaster and Deno's Wonder Wheel. In all, 19 rides and dozens of businesses were closed for nearly 48 hours.
By 3 p.m. Thursday, city officials decided that the significantly shorter tower was no longer swaying, making the Brooklyn amusement park safe again for large crowds on what is the typically busy Fourth of July holiday.
"We have been successful, we have been able to mitigate the risk," said Robert LiMandri, the city Building Department commissioner. Two more sections of the Astrotower were scheduled to be removed on Friday morning, officials said.
The gyro tower with a two-story observation deck was built in the 1960s as part of Astroland, a futuristic theme park. The ride took visitors to a donut-shaped landing, which had fondly been referred to as a "big bagel in the sky." The tower ceased operations when Astroland closed in 2008.


Employer Mandate? Never Mind
These columns fought the Affordable Care Act from start to passage, and we'd now like to apologize to our readers. It turns out we weren't nearly critical enough. The law's implementation is turning into a fiasco for the ages, and this week's version is the lawless White House decision to delay the law's insurance mandate for businesses, though not for individuals.
The employer mandate is central to ObamaCare's claim of providing universal coverage. Companies with 50 or more "employee equivalents" must pay a $2,000 penalty per full-time employee if they don't provide government-approved health insurance. The provision was supposed to start in January, and delaying it is like Ford saying its electric car is ready to go, except the electric battery doesn't work.
But all of a sudden on Tuesday evening Mark Mazur—you know him as the deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy—published a blog post canceling the insurance reporting rules and tax enforcement until 2015 as Washington began to evacuate for the long Independence Day weekend. Enjoy the holiday, mate.
White House fixer Valerie Jarrett tried to contain the fallout with a separate blog post promising that ObamaCare is otherwise "staying the course." That's true only if she's referring to the carelessness and improvisation that have defined the law so far.
Mr. Mazur cited the "complexity of the requirements" as the reason for the delay. He isn't talking about business confusion and uncertainty, as damaging as those are. This is probably an admission that Treasury's information technology isn't ready to process and cross-check paperwork across the 5.7 million businesses in America, especially the pass-through S-corps and partnerships that file under the individual tax code.


Park Sang Hak: North Korea's 'Enemy Zero'
Paju, South Korea
It's nerve-racking to drive toward the North Korean border with Park Sang Hak. Called "Fireball" by his admirers, the North Korean-born Mr. Park is designated "Enemy Zero" by the Pyongyang regime, which two years ago sent an agent into South Korea to assassinate him with a poison-tipped pen. On this summer morning, he promises to do again what so infuriates the Kim dictatorship—launch large balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets, computer-memory sticks and sweets for the oppressed people of the hermit kingdom.
In return, Pyongyang promises to "physically eliminate the kind of human scum that commits such treason." Adds the North Korean military: "The U.S. and the present puppet authorities of South Korea should not forget even a moment that the Rimjin Pavilion"—Mr. Park's favorite launch site near the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries—"is within the range of direct sighting strike" of the Korean People's Army.
North Korean threats are generally discounted as bluster, but driving toward the border has a way of concentrating the mind. The highway from the South carries little traffic in either direction and is separated from the Imjin River by barbed-wire fences, guard towers and civil-defense loudspeakers.
Yet once we arrive at the balloon-launch site, it becomes clear that Mr. Park has a different antagonist to contend with: South Korea, which has deployed a few hundred police to stop his airborne humanitarian mission. The police let him speak to assembled local media, but when Mr. Park tries to retrieve his balloons from a pickup truck, three rows of plainclothes officers block the way. Mr. Park tries to push through, but the police push back. When he tries to drive the truck slowly through the cordon to a different launch site, a large scuffle breaks out.


NTSB: 10 Killed in Alaska Plane Crash
Federal aviation regulators and accident investigators said they intend to examine the fatal crash of a propeller-powered air taxi plane, operated by Rediske Air Inc., which crashed and burned at the airport in Soldonta, AK., Sunday morning.
The Federal Aviation Administration said local law enforcement officials reported all 10 people aboard the de Havilland DHC-3 Otter perished, but details about what occurred remained fuzzy. Agency investigators headed for the crash site, even as an FAA spokesman said it wasn't clear whether the charter company's aircraft was taking off or landing at the time of the crash
The National Transportation Safety Board put out a separate release announcing that it was sending its own team, including a senior accident investigator and board member Earl Weener, to the site.
An employee who answered the telephone at Rediske's offices Sunday night said the company wasn't making any comments or issuing any statements.
For years, federal air-safety officials have been seeking ways to upgrade crew training, maintenance and other safety programs at many air-taxi operators.


Former Mafia Boss to Be Freed for Cooperation
A former mob boss, who once faced the death penalty after his conviction in eight murders then received a life sentence when he cooperated with authorities, was ordered released from prison Wednesday after serving 101⁄2 years behind bars.
Joseph Massino, the 70-year-old former head of the Bonanno crime family, was the highest-ranking member of a New York Mafia to turn state's witness.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said while he was "under no illusions about the motives for Mr. Massino's cooperation,..Quite simply, Mr. Massino may be the most important cooperator in the modern history of law enforcement efforts to prosecute the American Mafia."
"He has provided information about the highest levels of the Mafia, including testifying in open court, assisting dozens of investigations and helping lead to numerous additional arrests and convictions," the judge said.
Mr. Massino made a brief statement before Judge Garaufis announced he would grant the prosecution's request to reduce Mr. Massino's sentence.


Day Spas Busted for Alleged Prostitution in Brooklyn
A sudden spike in massage parlors in a compact section of Brooklyn led authorities to raid 12 businesses and arrest 19 people as part of an alleged prostitution ring, authorities announced Thursday.
The sting was the result of a yearlong investigation that began after residents in the neighborhoods of Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge began complaining about suspicious activity at new businesses operating as day spas and massage parlors, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said.
Complaints of street solicitation, late night traffic, drawn curtains and explicit Internet advertisements prompted authorities to conduct surveillance and undercover operations that led to Wednesday's raid, officials said.
"In this case, there were 19 massage parlors in a relatively small area," Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. "We know that people in Bay Ridge have back pain, but we don't think that it is enough to sustain 19 massage parlors.
"What's unique here is the rapid proliferation," Mr. Kelly said.


Contractor's Ties to China Fuel Dispute
When CCA Civil Inc. won a bid this spring to rebuild a section of the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey, the runner-up in the contest saw a chance to snatch away the huge road-building job.
CCA Civil is a division of China Construction America Inc., the U.S. arm of China State Construction Engineering Corp., one of the largest Chinese building companies.
Because the government of China has an ownership interest in the parent company, and in companies that have done energy-sector work in Iran, the rival contractor charges, CCA Civil should be barred from receiving government contracts in New Jersey under a new divestment law aimed at isolating the Middle Eastern nation.
The rival contractor, Conti Enterprises Inc., unsuccessfully petitioned the New Jersey Department of Transportation to choose not to award the contract, and has filed to block it in state appellate court.
In filings to the DOT and legal briefs, CCA Civil denied claims that it is directly owned or controlled by China, that it has corporate links to companies working in Iran and that it is subject to new laws that ban certain companies from receiving government contracts.


Drug War Grinds On After Cartel Arrest
MEXICO CITY—Mexico's capture of Miguel Ángel Treviño—who authorities say ran the Zetas drug gang with such ferocity that he'd sometimes boil enemies alive in grease—leaves the government a key challenge: How to dismantle the rest of the decentralized cartel.
The Zetas differ from other drug cartels in that local cells handle most of the crime, from transporting drugs to extorting local businesses, law-enforcement officials and analysts said on Tuesday.
"Capturing the head doesn't signal the death knell of the Zetas," said Gavin Strong, the Americas analyst for security firm Control Risks. "They can lose top leadership but the model stays intact."


Quake Rattles New Zealand
WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Wellington's downtown was largely deserted on Monday, with banks, trading rooms floors and government agencies including New Zealand's treasury shut as engineers assessed buildings for structural damage after a magnitude-6.5 quake Sunday. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he was advised that the capital city didn't sustain any major damage. No injuries were reported.
However, parts of the city remained cordoned off due to falling masonry, there are numerous smashed windows resulting in glass being strewn on the streets and a number of offices have sustained minor damage with televisions falling off walls, computer screens being knocked over and ceiling panels dislodged.
The earthquake struck off the east coast of New Zealand's South Island in Cook Strait at a depth of just 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. More than 20 aftershocks have been recorded since the main earthquake, according to GeoNet, a New Zealand government monitoring agency.
A number of buildings have been cordoned off as they are checked for structural weakness. Access to areas of New Zealand's parliament was restricted for a time.
Windows shattered, masonry fell and fire alarms were tripped at a number of buildings and emergency services continue to check safety.


Labor-Board Picks Vow to Be Impartial
WASHINGTON—Two new nominees for the National Labor Relations Board, both Democratic lawyers, responded to tough questions from Republican lawmakers during their confirmation hearing Tuesday, pledging to take a neutral approach to union-management issues.
Nancy Schiffer, a former associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO, and Kent Hirozawa, who works at the board as chief counsel to Chairman Mark Pearce, faced skeptical Republicans on the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah who said other union lawyers who'd become board members had broken similar promises to be impartial.
Looking squarely at Ms. Schiffer, Mr. Hatch asked, "How can you assure us you won't be another union partisan on the NLRB?"
Ms. Schiffer acknowledged she has advocated for unions while working at the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers, but said that during her stint at an NLRB regional office in Detroit she investigated and prosecuted unfair labor practice cases against employers and unions and brought picket line injunctions against unions.
"I can assure you that I understand the importance of this office and how critical it is that board members be neutral arbiters of the law," she said.


Teresa Heinz Kerry Leaves Hospital
Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Secretary of State John Kerry, left a rehabilitation hospital in Boston on Saturday, nearly three weeks after she was stricken with a seizure, a spokesman said. She is expected to make a full recovery.
Mrs. Heinz Kerry, 74, showed signs of a seizure and was rushed to the hospital near the couple's home in Nantucket, Mass., on July 7. She was quickly transferred to a hospital in Boston and days later to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
Doctors expect her "to complete a full recovery at home after some limited outpatient treatment," Glen Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said.
He previously said doctors had ruled out underlying problems such as a heart attack, stroke or brain tumor.
Born and raised in Mozambique, Mrs. Heinz Kerry is the widow of U.S. Sen. John Heinz, heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune, who died in a plane crash in 1991. She married Mr. Kerry in 1995.


New York State Rethinks Medicaid
To bring down its soaring Medicaid budget, New York state wants to move thousands of low-income patients from hospitals, homeless shelters, group homes and nursing facilities into apartments.
The state says many of the people it wants to shift don't need the expensive, residential medical care they now receive, which is paid for by the state and by a crucial financial match from Medicaid, the federal program that provides health care for the poor.
Instead, the patients would live in what is known as supportive-housing apartments, which provide services such as counseling, budgeting help and coordination of medical care.
Some advocates and families, however, worry the arrangements wouldn't provide adequate security or care for residents, and the adult-home industry has also opposed such moves. And so far, the federal government has declined to match funds for the project, saying Medicaid dollars aren't designed to pay living costs.
But the state intends to go ahead with the pilot project and spend $47 million on its own to build 12 supportive-housing facilities, where 5,000 people would live. The apartments would cost New York $50 to $70 per day per patient, compared with $210 for a nursing home and significantly more in a hospital, said Jason Helgerson, New York state's Medicaid director.


You Can Take It With You When You Visit National Parks
National Park Service chief groundskeeper Anthony Migliaccio piloted his utility vehicle down the George Washington Memorial Parkway, surveying the good, the bad and the ugly in the government's new effort to get visitors to do something that doesn't come naturally: haul away their own garbage.
The idea behind project Carry In-Carry Out, explained Mr. Migliaccio, is to free up the park service's trash haulers to pursue more noble beautification projects, such as flower planting.
On a recent day, one lonely can in a busy park overflowed with visitors' refuse. Meanwhile, a nearby dispenser of free plastic trash bags—each printed with a plea for folks to retain their own waste—remained full.


Mugabe Tightens Grip on Zimbabwe
HARARE, Zimbabwe—President Robert Mugabe has tightened his grip on power with a commanding victory in a disputed election, heightening Zimbabwe's political instability and exacerbating the troubled southern African nation's diplomatic and economic isolation.
The 89-year-old Mr. Mugabe, who has governed since leading Zimbabwe out of white-minority rule in 1980, won 61% of 3.5 million votes cast in Wednesday's election, official results released Saturday show.
Longtime foe Morgan Tsvangirai won 33%. There were 6.4 million eligible voters.
Meantime, Mr. Mugabe's Zanu-PF party garnered a two-thirds majority in the separate Parliament ballot, improving from less than half before.
The election, however, was tinged with allegations of irregularities that included votes allegedly cast on behalf of more than 1 million deceased voters and the names of many active voters being omitted from the rolls.


Street Safety Gains Traction as Political Issue
Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio wants to get the number of New Yorkers who are killed or badly injured in city traffic crashes down to zero.
The Brooklyn Democrat isn't alone among mayoral hopefuls making campaign promises to make city streets less hazardous. This week, fellow Democrat Anthony Weiner's new policy package included calls for improvements in pedestrian and traffic safety. Christine Quinn has pledged to cut the number of fatalities in half by 2021.
Advocates for pedestrians and cyclists plan Wednesday to rally at City Hall for more attention to street safety following a spate of crashes that killed pedestrians around the city, including a 16-year-old girl crossing the street July 31 on the Upper East Side.
The attention to traffic safety is a positive sign for supporters of some of the street-management policies implemented by the Bloomberg administration and its transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan. But they want more.
A mayoral field that feels the pressure to propose solutions to dangers faced by walkers, bicyclists and drivers is one that will do so, said Noah Budnick, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, which is organizing Wednesday's rally. The group recently completed a survey of mayoral candidates and found them insufficiently aggressive on pedestrian safety, he said.


Crackdown Looms in Egypt
CAIRO—Egyptian government officials said police could crack down as early as Monday on two vast camps in Cairo supporting ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a move that could lead to clashes as impassioned demonstrators hunker down in the tent cities.
Thousands of protesters have created a vast city of their own within Cairo's Raba'a al Adiwiya square over the past six weeks, pitching tents that now house pharmacies, bouncy castle playgrounds and entire families. As children slept on a recent night, sounds of wedding celebrations and political chants filled the evening air.
But the camp's labyrinth of alleyways brimming with antigovernment demonstrators poses a logistical challenge to the Egyptian authorities, known for their use of force in clearing past protests. The military-installed Egyptian government announced last week that it would clear out Raba'a and Nahda square, home to the smaller camp, after negotiations over the current political stalemate with the Muslim Brotherhood failed.
The police say they plan to lay siege to the tent cities, using tactics such as creating cordons and refusing to allow food and water to enter the sit-ins. Muslim Brotherhood officials and camp residents say they are determined to withstand any blockade. To thwart the crackdown, protesters have used jackhammers to break up roads and erected a large, covered wooden structure at one of Raba'a's main entrances. Volunteers sporting hard hats and sticks guard the fortresslike walls.
"Do you know the Prophet Muhammad?" asked Essam El Erian, a senior Brotherhood official. "He and his followers lived for three years under siege by the infidels without food or water."


In Iowa, It Looks a Lot Like 2016
AMES, Iowa—Iowans this past weekend had their pick of corn dogs, pork chops, Rick Santorum or Ted Cruz.
The first two offerings were popular delicacies at the state fair. The others are Republicans already jockeying over what is expected to be a wide-open 2016 presidential race, barely nine months after the latest one concluded and more than two years before any party primaries would start.
Mr. Cruz, a first-year U.S. senator from Texas, on Saturday made his second trip to Iowa this summer. He and Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, addressed a forum of Iowa evangelicals here. They were joined by real-estate developer turned reality-television star Donald Trump. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow Republican, was in Des Moines a week earlier to attend an event organized by a prominent GOP donor in the state.
Democrats looking to 2016 aren't advertising their intent as openly because President Barack Obama has more than three years left in his term, and because prospective candidates are waiting for a decision from the putative front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hasn't made her intentions known. That said, Vice President Joe Biden caused a stir late Sunday when a representative confirmed he will speak next month at Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, a traditional platform for White House hopefuls.
Meanwhile, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had made overtures to the Iowa delegation during last year's Democratic National Convention, will be headlining a fundraiser for the North Iowa Democrats later this week, making her the first potential Democratic candidate to visit the state this year. Ms. Klobuchar has played down her interest in the race but hasn't dismissed the prospect of a bid entirely.


New Jersey Gay Marriage Case Stalled
TRENTON—A New Jersey judge declined to rule Thursday on a case seeking to bring gay marriage to New Jersey following the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to strike down key provisions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
Attorneys arguing the case said they weren't surprised by the postponement in the complex case, but it was a blow to the gay couples who have petitioned for marriage for years.
"Why do we have to wait even one more day?" said Cindy Meneghin, a 55-year-old Butler, N.J., resident who is a plaintiff in the case with her partner of 38 years and their two children. "The state of New Jersey wants to treat me like a second-class citizen when it comes to my relationship."
State attorneys have fought against the effort, arguing New Jersey's current civil unions suffice for gay couples. Republican Gov. Chris Christie supports civil unions but is against gay marriage, and he vetoed a bill passed last year that would have allowed for it.
Advocates are working to override Mr. Christie veto in the Legislature, and have made progress in appealing to some Republicans, said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, New Jersey's main gay rights group.


China's Xi Embraces Mao as He Tightens Grip
WUHAN, China—On a visit here in July, Chinese President Xi Jinping went to a lakeside villa where Mao Zedong spent summers in the 1950s enjoying such luxuries as a swimming pool and air conditioning. Opening a new exhibition there that makes no mention of the millions who died under Mao's leadership, Mr. Xi declared that the villa should be a center for educating youth about patriotism and revolution.
A week earlier, he went to a village from which Mao attacked Beijing in 1949. There, Mr. Xi vowed that "our red nation will never change color."
It isn't just Mr. Xi's rhetoric that has taken on a Maoist tinge in recent months. He has borrowed from Mao's tactical playbook, launching a "rectification" campaign to purify the Communist Party, while tightening limits on discussion of ideas such as democracy, rule of law and enforcement of the constitution.
Mr. Xi's apparent lurch to the left comes as Chinese authorities prepare for the coming trial of Bo Xilai, the former party rising star who led a Maoist revival movement until his dramatic downfall last year. Two of Mr. Bo's lawyers said they expected the trial where he faces corruption charges to take place next week. Before he was detained, Mr. Bo rejected allegations of corruption.
The Chinese president's Maoist leanings have dismayed many advocates of political reform, who hoped that Mr. Bo's downfall signaled a repudiation of his autocratic leadership style and might lead to a strengthening of the rule of law and other limits on party power.


U.K. Told White House of Plan To Detain Reporter's Partner in Advance
SÃO PAULO, Brazil—The U.K. informed the White House in advance that it would detain the Brazilian partner of a Guardian reporter during a stopover at London's Heathrow Airport, White House officials said Monday.
A White House spokesman said U.S. officials hadn't been involved in the decision to detain the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has written a series of stories on U.S. surveillance programs based on documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
"There was a heads-up that was provided," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. "But that detention was a decision that was made by the British government," he added, referring further questions to U.K. authorities.
U.K. authorities cited terrorism laws for detaining David Miranda, 28 years old, for nine hours as he was changing planes for Brazil over the weekend and confiscated his computer and other electronics.
Mr. Greenwald told the Associated Press in an email that Mr. Miranda was transporting documents between him and a documentary filmmaker related to his NSA stories. In a statement, the Guardian said it paid for Mr. Miranda's flights and that although he wasn't an employee of the British newspaper, Mr. Miranda often assisted Mr. Greenwald in his work. In an editorial published online Monday, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger called the use of terrorism laws to detain people such as Mr. Miranda a "threat to journalism."


Stringer, Spitzer Clash in Comptroller Debate
In their last official debate before the Sept. 10 Democratic primary, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer each played up their roots Thursday night.
There was Mr. Spitzer, the brash, self-described fighter claiming that his lack of political friends gave him valuable independence. Then there was Mr. Stringer, who repeatedly argued that his establishment support and experience showed that he was a trustworthy, steady hand fit to run the city's pension system
It is a clash that has defined the contentious primary between the two vastly different politicians and continued Thursday on issues ranging from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ambitious plan to rezone Midtown East (Mr. Stringer supports it, Mr. Spitzer does not) to whether they'd accept the job's $185,000 salary (Mr. Spitzer, a multimillionaire, would work for $1 a year; Mr. Stringer, who isn't as wealthy, wants the full paycheck).
The pair differed on powerful state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is under fire from critics for inadequately responding to sexual harassment claims against Assembly members. In response to a question about whether the speaker should resign, Mr. Spitzer said the Assembly should elect a new speaker, while Mr. Stringer, who served with Mr. Silver in the Assembly, said he wanted to see the results of an investigation first.
Mr. Spitzer repeatedly attacked Mr. Stringer for supporting the overturning of term limits in 2009, a move that let Mr. Bloomberg run for a third term as mayor—something unpopular with the Democratic primary electorate.


GOP Mayoral Race Gets Hostile With New Ads
Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis on Monday released a new television advertisement bashing rival Joe Lhota for describing Port Authority police officers as "nothing more than mall cops," the latest attack in an increasingly hostile battle for the GOP nomination for New York City mayor.
Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a former deputy mayor in Rudy Giuliani's administration, apologized in May for the remark.
"I'm very, very much concerned that he doesn't have the temperament to be mayor—he flies off the handle," Mr. Catsimatidis, a businessman, said in an interview. "Why would he call hard-working policemen mall cops? I mean, see, there's a flaw."
Mr. Catsimatidis, who is behind Mr. Lhota in polls, also cited the time Mr. Lhota referred to Mayor Michael Bloomberg as an "idiot" after superstorm Sandy, another remark for which Mr. Lhota apologized. When reminded of Mr. Lhota's apology record, Mr. Catsimatidis replied, "What good is apologizing if you do it? I mean, 'Oh, I'm sorry I murdered you.' I think an apology is no good. It shows the inner quality of a person."
The commercial—the latest in an escalating ad war—was being run on broadcast and cable networks. An aide to Mr. Catsimatidis said the candidate has purchased air time for a number of ads at a cost that is in the high six figures. The campaign has "maxed out" how much it can buy on some stations, the aide said.


Nursing Homes' Drug Use Falls
A two-year effort by the federal government and the nursing-home industry has reduced the use of powerful antipsychotic drugs among elderly nursing-home residents, but the decline fell short of the program's goal, according to U.S. officials.
The percentage of patients receiving antipsychotics fell to 21.7% in the first quarter of 2013 from an average of 23.9% in the last quarter of 2011—a 9% decrease, according to data the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to release as early as this week.
When CMS, which oversees spending on the big federal health-care programs for the elderly and poor, embarked on its effort to work with the nursing-home industry to cut the use of such drugs, the agency's goal was for nursing homes to achieve a 15% reduction in the rate of usage by the end of 2012.
The effort came amid fears that antipsychotic drugs were being overused, especially on the elderly with dementia or Alzheimer's, to whom the drugs pose a potentially higher risk of death. In recent years, the rise of a new type of antipsychotic known as atypicals—originally hailed as having fewer side effects and sold under names like Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa or Abilify—coincided with their growing use among people in nursing homes.
There are about 1.5 million nursing-home patients in the U.S, according to CMS.


Long Shots Are Carrying On
Sal Albanese, George McDonald and the Rev. Erick Salgado Jr. have a few things in common.
First, they all want to be your next mayor after Michael Bloomberg vacates City Hall in four months. Second, like Mr. Bloomberg in the 2001 mayoral election, all three will tell you they're the only candidate who isn't a "career politician." And third, a solid majority of New Yorkers has no idea who they are.
In an election cycle filled with big political personalities, celebrity endorsements and the occasional scandal, Messrs. Albanese, McDonald and Salgado are the long-shot candidates. And they have labeled as unjust the lack of attention given to their campaigns.
"How do you get to pronounce someone a loser before the election?" Mr. McDonald, a Republican, asked on Friday in an interview near Gramercy Park. "What is my service to New York City worth to the political pundits? Not much."
Mr. McDonald is running against two better-known GOP opponents, former Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Joe Lhota and billionaire John Catsimatidis, the owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain. In an Aug. 16 Wall Street Journal/NBC 4 New York/Marist poll, Mr. McDonald garnered 12% of registered Republican voters, compared with 33% for Mr. Lhota and 22% for Mr. Catsimatidis. The margin of error was 8.5 percentage points.


New Polls Show Slip in Support for Spitzer
Eliot Spitzer's standing in the race for city comptroller has fallen sharply in recent weeks, according to a pair of new polls released Thursday, with Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer appearing to have chipped away at the former New York governor's popularity among black voters.
Mr. Spitzer is tied at 46% with Mr. Stringer among likely Democratic primary voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.
A separate poll from amNewYork-News 12 and Penn Schoen Berland shows that Mr. Spitzer has 46% support among likely Democratic primary voters, with Mr. Stringer at 43%.
Those results mark a substantial shift from recent poll figures. A Quinnipiac poll released just two weeks ago gave Mr. Spitzer a 19-point lead over Mr. Stringer. But Mr. Spitzer had a narrower lead among likely Democratic primary voters—just four percentage points—in a Quinnipiac poll taken one month ago.
"I think it's pretty clear when I can contrast my record with that of my opponent, we're getting votes," Mr. Stringer said Thursday. "When I can introduce my record to people, we're getting votes."


Crooks in the Cubicle
A new study has found a different type of gender gap in the workplace: Women tend to be more honest.
In a study of a Justice Department database of 83 corporate frauds from 2002 to 2009, researchers found that women were way less likely to take part in such crimes. Indeed, three-quarters of the conspiracies covered in the study were entirely male, but not one was entirely female. Of the 436 defendants in the study, fewer than one in 10 was a woman. "Men are disproportionately involved," says Darrell Steffensmeier, the lead author.
When women were involved, they tended to play a minor supporting role—and to receive way less of any ill-gotten gains, even controlling for their generally lower corporate rank. While more than half of male defendants made at least $500,000, more than half the women made no personal profit. Some knowingly broke the law to help the company they worked for, or simply at the direction of a boss.
Only three of the women were identified by the researchers as conspiracy ringleaders, and only one of those three wasn't married to a male ringleader. By contrast, 156 of the men qualified as a ringleader. "Sex segregation in corporate criminality is pervasive," the researchers write.


Candidates Find Boston Mayor a Tough Act to Follow
BOSTON—The planned retirement of Mayor Thomas Menino, the longest-serving mayor in Boston's history, has unleashed the pent-up political ambition of a generation, with a dozen contenders vying to take his place in the city's first competitive mayoral election in 20 years.
Labor Day weekend marks the start of a final campaign push toward a nonpartisan preliminary vote on Sept. 24, when two finalists will head into the November election. The winner will replace Mr. Menino, when his fifth term ends in January.
For many Bostonians, breaking up with Mr. Menino is proving hard to do: As candidates struggle to overcome weak name recognition and identify compelling platforms, two recent polls found that at least 35% of voters remained undecided, while no contender has attracted more than 12% of voter support. Meanwhile, a poll in July showed Mr. Menino enjoyed an 82% approval rating.
A panoply of colorful campaign signs lining the fence in front of Randy Browne's auto-repair shop in the Dorchester neighborhood illustrates the mood. Mr. Browne said he allowed any campaign that asked to put up a sign to do so. But with a shrug, the 59-year-old registered Democrat acknowledged he is unfamiliar with the field and hasn't decided whom to back. "I know Menino," he said. "I vote for Menino."
Slowed by an array of health problems, the 70-year-old Mr. Menino, a Democrat, said in March he wouldn't run for re-election, ending a tenure that began in 1993. Then a Boston City Council president, he rose to acting mayor when former Mayor Raymond Flynn was named ambassador to the Vatican. Mr. Menino was elected on his own that November.


At the Last Minute, Obama Alone Made Call
After a 45-minute walk Friday night, President Barack Obama made a fateful decision that none of his top national security advisers saw coming: To seek congressional authorization before taking military action in Syria.
The stunning about-face after a week of U.S. saber rattling risked not only igniting a protracted congressional fight, which could end with a vote against strikes, but a backlash from allies in the Middle East who had warned the White House that inaction would embolden not only Syrian President Bashar al-Assad but his closest allies, Iran and Hezbollah.
Aides said the decision was made by Mr. Obama and Mr. Obama alone. It shows the primacy the president places on protecting his hoped-for legacy as a commander in chief who did everything in his power to disentangle the U.S. from overseas wars. Until Friday night, Mr. Obama's national-security team didn't even have an option on the table to seek a congressional authorization.
The only real discussion was a plan to punish Mr. Assad for what the U.S. and others have called a chemical-weapons attack amid Syria's grinding civil war. The final question, policy makers thought, was how many targets to hit and when to tell the Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean to open fire.
Yet Mr. Obama made no secret to aides he felt uncomfortable acting without U.N. Security Council backing. Current and former officials said his decision reflected his concerns about being seen as acting unilaterally—without political cover from Congress and without the U.K. at his side. Arab states, for their part, have offered little public support despite their private encouragement.


Putin Admits Early Snowden Contact
MOSCOW—President Vladimir Putin conceded that Edward Snowden contacted Russian diplomats in Hong Kong a few days before boarding a plane to Moscow, but said that no agreement was reached to shelter him and that the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor decided on his own to come to Russia.
Mr. Putin had previously said that Mr. Snowden's arrival at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 was a "complete surprise."
But in an interview with Russia's Channel One and the Associated Press, released on Wednesday, he acknowledged that he had some prior knowledge that the fugitive might be headed Russia's way.
"Mr. Snowden first appeared in Hong Kong and met with our diplomatic representatives," Mr. Putin said. "It was reported to me that there was such an employee, an employee of the security services. I asked, 'What does he want?' He fights for human rights, for freedom of information and challenges violations of human rights and violations of the law in the United States. I said, 'So what?' "
He said he had been willing to allow Mr. Snowden to come to Russia, but only if he stopped leaking highly classified details of U.S. intelligence programs.


Jilting EU, Armenia Ties Knot With Moscow
European diplomats were stunned this week by word that Armenia, which had been heading toward strengthening ties with the European Union, will instead join a customs union led by Russia—handing the Kremlin a victory in its tug of war with Brussels for influence in the region.
The question now is whether Armenia's move foreshadows similar decisions by other former Soviet republics.
Armenia's shift was announced Tuesday in a statement posted on the Kremlin website during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Armenian counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan.
"This is a rational decision, it is a decision based on Armenia's national interests," President Sargsyan said afterward, according to a transcript on the Kremlin's website. "The decision is not a rejection of our dialogue with European institutions."
The small country in the South Caucasus region had been expected to initial an "association agreement" with the EU at a summit in November, in Vilnius, Lithuania, strengthening trade relations while committing Armenia to democratic changes.


Colombia's President Shuffles Cabinet as Farmers' Strike Persists
BOGOTÁ—President Juan Manuel Santos overhauled some key posts in his cabinet Thursday as his government works to end a strike led by poor farmers that has sapped his popularity ratings.
Mr. Santos late Thursday said he was replacing five of the 16 ministers in his cabinet, including Agriculture Minister Francisco Estupiñán and Fernando Carrillo, the Interior Minister, the pair who spearheaded the government's efforts in the past few weeks to end the strike by farmers demanding tax exemptions and government subsidies.
Ruben Dario Lizarralde, a former businessmen in the farming sector, will now lead the agriculture ministry while Aurelio Iragorri, who has served as an adviser to Mr. Santos, will take over the interior ministry. Other changes also included the heads of the environment ministry, the energy and mining ministry, and the justice ministry.
The changes signal that Mr. Santos is looking to revamp his administration ahead of a potential re-election bid in 2014 that has been jeopardized by a plunge in his popularity ratings. His government has struggled to address the demands of the farmers, who continue to block major roads in large parts of the country leaving several towns isolated.
It was the ministers of agriculture and interior that represented the government at the negotiation table with a group representing the bulk of the striking farmers that continue to demand tax exemptions for fertilizers and other inputs, and subsidies to offset a decline in the prices of their crops.


Tough Pitch Made to Weary Nation
In his speech to the nation Tuesday night, President Barack Obama had to muster not one argument, but two.
The first was an argument for keeping alive the threat of military action against Syria. The civilized world, he said, must respond to a use of chemical weapons there, and only the U.S. can lead that response.
That, in some ways, was the simpler argument. Mr. Obama, in fact, didn't ask for anything in particular from Congress or the American people, except that they not slam shut the door to a military strike in case diplomacy doesn't rein in Syria's arms programs.
Mr. Obama's second argument, though, was broader and harder. It was an argument against his country's fundamental war weariness.
That weariness is the backdrop of the times, and Mr. Obama acknowledged that he shared it; indeed, some would argue that he won the White House by capitalizing on it.


U.S., Russia Agree on Syrian Plan
GENEVA—The U.S. and Russia agreed Saturday on a broad framework for destroying Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons by the first half of next year.
Under the agreement between Moscow and Washington, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must provide a complete list of the types, quantity and locations of his country's chemical-weapons stockpiles to the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons by next Friday.
The plan will be codified in a U.N. Security Council resolution that won't rely on a threat of military action for enforcement, officials indicated. The U.S., France and Western allies had favored arming any U.N. resolution with a threat of force for noncompliance. But opposition from Moscow forced the Obama administration to drop the demand to pursue a diplomatic outcome and avoid U.S. military action.
Instead of a threat of force, an initial U.N. resolution will put into effect the process of inspection and destruction of Syria's chemical warfare infrastructure. If inspectors complain of noncompliance, a second U.N. resolution could be adopted under a U.N. rules that in some instances allows for the use of force.
However, Russia's opposition to force makes it nearly certain that any U.N. resolution on Syria will avoid military penalties, U.S. officials acknowledge, while reserving the right for military strikes by the U.S. acting on its own or with allies.


James Roberts: The Missing Medals of Honor
On Aug. 26, Army Staff Sgt. Ty Michael Carter received the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. The 33-year-old husband and father of three was given the nation's highest military award for braving enemy fire to carry a wounded comrade to safety during a fierce battle in eastern Afghanistan on Oct. 3, 2009.
The award is cause for renewed pride in today's military. It invites reflection on the extraordinary actions of the 74 living recipients of the Medal of Honor whose service spans more than six decades, from World War II to Afghanistan. So far, however, that list does not include Iraq.
Four posthumous Medal of Honor awards have been presented to the families of men who were killed Iraq. But the absence of awards for living veterans of that war is a serious injustice. It is time for remedial action.
Consider: 124 Medals of Honor were awarded for service in World War I, 464 in World War II, 136 in the Korean War and 247 in Vietnam. Two soldiers who died in Somalia in 1993 and eight who fought in Afghanistan received the award (three of them posthumously). Yet for Iraq—a conflict that lasted for almost a decade in which more than 1.5 million American men and women served, 32,226 were wounded, and 4,487 were killed in action—there have been only four awards, and none to living veterans.
In 2009, there were no living Medal of Honor recipients from either the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. That changed after then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said during a Pentagon news conference that it was impossible to believe that none of the more than 2.5 million servicemen and women who had seen combat in those conflicts had earned the honor.


Violent Exchanges Followed Initial Confusion
The mentally troubled gunman who opened fire at a building in the Washington Navy Yard on Monday spent more than a half-hour in the building, and his shooting spree was brought to an end by a series of violent exchanges with heavily armed police, authorities said Tuesday.
The new information was part of a clearer picture authorities were able to piece together of the violence after initial confusion, although many details remained unclear.
Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old who worked for a Navy subcontractor, drove onto the facility Monday morning, using a valid contractor identification card that allowed him access to both the Navy Yard complex and individual buildings, authorities said.
He walked into Building 197 with a Remington tactical shotgun he had legally purchased the previous week in Virginia, police officials said. A lawyer for the gun store where Mr. Alexis purchased the weapon said he also bought 24 shells for the shotgun. Mr. Alexis also used an AR-15 rifle at the store's practice range but didn't purchase one, the lawyer said.
Investigators increasingly believe Mr. Alexis carried the shotgun up to the fourth floor of the building, where he fired the weapon down at unsuspecting workers. He then left that position, shot a security officer, took the officer's handgun, and then used that handgun to continue firing on people in and outside the building, according to an official.


As 2016 Looms, Two Governors Take Partisan Spat to the Airwaves
Republican Gov. Rick Perry has been traveling the country—to states led by Democrats—in an effort to lure companies to his home state of Texas, which he says has the low-tax climate and regulatory environment most favorable to business.
But Mr. Perry's trip Wednesday to Maryland has drawn particular attention, and not just because the state's Democratic governor, Martin O'Malley, has fired back by accusing the Texas governor of promoting a "slash-and-burn economic philosophy" that cuts funding for schools and health care.
The overlay of the still-distant 2016 presidential election brings extra attention to the spat. Both Messrs. Perry and O'Malley are potential candidates for their party's nomination, and each is pushing economic arguments aimed at appealing to his party's base voters.
Moreover, both are going out of their way to draw attention to their dispute, by appearing Wednesday evening on the CNN program "Crossfire," which specializes in such partisan firefights.
Mr. Perry arrived in Maryland Wednesday, the sixth stop on a tour touting his state's economic policies. He has been running advertisements preceding his visit to each state. In the most recent ad, he pointedly advises business owners to "think Texas" when they tire of "Maryland taxes squeezing every dime out of your business."


Germany's Election About Nothing
What will German voters be choosing when they go to the polls on Sunday? A new Parliament, definitely, but not likely a new direction for their government. In this year's federal election campaign, the parties' platforms could have been written two years ago, the candidates for Chancellor are allergic to bold ideas, and opinion polls have been flat for months, only tightening a little in the last few weeks. Europe's most important election since the financial crisis is an election about nothing.
It's a problem most politicians would bail out Greece four or five times to have. The strength of the Continent's largest economy means neither voters nor elected officials in Germany feel the need to try something different. But the low-stakes campaign this year has largely avoided the high-stakes questions about fortifying Germany's economic resilience. And it has postponed the even higher-stakes questions about resolving the problems still festering in the euro zone.
***
The surest bet for the government in Berlin that emerges after Sunday is that Angela Merkel will still lead it. Chancellor Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats, or CDU, have governed in coalition with the Free Democrats since 2009, and before then with the center-left Social Democrats since 2005. Steering the country through eight stormy years, Mrs. Merkel has won a reputation for solidity, competence and quiet cunning.
But the Chancellor's 60%-plus personal approval rating has made her party content to coast this year. The CDU platform calls for higher child allowances to encourage larger families, a cap on rent increases, and continued commitment to Germany's rigorous fiscal discipline. But the party spurns bolder policy changes like tax cuts, which were on the Merkel government's agenda after the 2009 election. Mrs. Merkel's pitch this year boils down to "Trust me. Deutschland is doing all right."
This should have been a natural opportunity for the business-friendly Free Democrats, or FDP, to offer a redoubled reform agenda for Germany. Yet the party's campaign this year contains little to address the rigid labor laws, extensive professional protections and high labor taxes that restrict Germany's growth potential. This failure, exacerbated by intra-party feuding, has been costly. On Sunday the FDP will be lucky to scrape together the 5% of the vote needed to win seats in the Bundestag.


Jim Gray: Our City Did Pension Reform and Lived to Tell the Tale
Lexington, Ky.
If there is any hopeful news for Chicago, Detroit, Illinois and the other places where public pension funds are collectively underwater by an estimated $1 trillion, it is this: A body of pension-reform successes now exists to light the way. Our reform in Lexington has been described as a national model, and there are lessons for those hoping to avoid the bankruptcy fate of Stockton, Calif., and Central Falls, R.I.
Lexington normally feels like a well-off university city of 300,000. It's a culturally rich urban island surrounded by world-class thoroughbred farms and infused with a tradition of progressive, nonpartisan governance.
Yet by 2012 Lexington's police and fire pension obligations were wreaking havoc on the city's budget. Annual payments had exploded from $10 million in 2005 to a projected $48 million for 2013. Despite an infusion of $135 million from pension bonds between 2009 and 2012, the unfunded liability reached $296 million or $2,400 per household in 2012.
Today Lexington is being held up by pension watchers as a model for its sweeping reform. So how were we able to cut our unfunded liability by 45%, (effective the moment Gov. Steve Beshear signed the reform into law on March 14), institute comprehensive benefit changes, and still have a whopping 76% of beneficiaries vote to send the reform package to the state legislature?


BofA Ordered to Pay About $2.2 Million for Alleged Hiring Bias
A U.S. Department of Labor administrative law judge has ordered Bank of America Corp. to pay 1,147 African-American job applicants back wages and interest for alleged race-based hiring discrimination at the bank's Charlotte, N.C., location in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Judge Linda Chapman ordered the bank to pay the African-American job applicants roughly $2.2 million as a result of "unfair and inconsistent selection criteria" which excluded African-American applications for teller and entry-level clerical and administrative positions, according to a press release on Monday from the Department of Labor.
Nearly $1 million will be distributed to 1,034 applicants who were rejected in 1993. The remainder will be given to 113 individuals rejected between 2002 and 2005, the agency said. The bank will also be required to offer jobs "with appropriate seniority" to 10 individuals.
The case has spanned nearly two decades after the agency's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs in November 1993 found "systemic hiring discrimination" at the Charlotte facility, according to the release.
"We are currently reviewing this recommended decision and order, which arises from a 1995 review," a Bank of America spokesman said in an emailed statement. "At Bank of America, diversity and inclusion are part of our culture and core company values. We actively promote an environment where all employees have the opportunity to succeed."


Tehran Stands Firm on Nuclear Program
UNITED NATIONS—Iran's new President Hasan Rouhani pledged on Tuesday that his government will remove "all reasonable concerns" about Tehran's nuclear program, but insisted that the West recognize Iran's right to enrich uranium.
In his first major appearance on the world stage, Mr. Rouhani sought to reinforce an image as a moderate voice, saying he was ready to engage in "time-bound and results-oriented" nuclear talks and would look to improve ties with the U.S.
However diplomats said Mr. Rouhani's half-hour speech to the United Nations General Assembly offered no major breakthrough. Although he spoke just a few hours after President Barack Obama, the two didn't meet.
"Iran's nuclear program—and for that matter, that of all other countries—must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes," Mr. Rouhani said. "Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran's security and defense doctrine," he added. "Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran's peaceful nuclear program."
Mr. Rouhani took office last month after a sweeping win in Iran's presidential elections in June. Since that victory, he has made several gestures aimed at differentiating himself from Iran's previous leaders, above all his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.


Groups Leading Insurance Sign-Ups Haven't Tested Program's Web Tool
Many of the community groups that will sign up New Yorkers up for health insurance beginning Tuesday are uneasy they haven't tested the online portal that governs the system.
"That's the one thing we would have liked," said Elizabeth Benjamin, with the Community Service Society of New York, who added that she believed the system would work.
State officials said they never planned to allow community providers access to the portal before the Oct. 1 launch. A state Department of Health spokesman said testing was still under way to ensure the system worked but that everything was "on track."
The online sign-up involves combing through coverage options, deductibles and prices, a process expected to take 30 to 45 minutes. The community workers have been trained on the Web tool but haven't tried it.
Others said they expected computer glitches in the first day or two. "The kinks, they'll all come out on day one," said Lorraine Leong, with the William F. Ryan Community Health Center.


Proceedings | Highlights from the Law Blog
Linkrot Attacks
The Supreme Court
Linkrot.
It sounds like what happened to the Law Blog's leftover Memorial Day hot dogs.
But the term actually refers to broken links on old Web pages, an irritating but inevitable part of online life. The scourge afflicts not only online news sites and film-review aggregators but U.S. Supreme Court opinions as well.
Since 1996, the court has included more than 500 links to online material in its opinions. But according to a recent Harvard study, half the links in the opinions no longer work. The authors of the paper, Harvard law and computer-science professor Jonathan Zittrain and law student Kendra Albert, suggest a "permalink" solution. They are developing a site, perma.cc, that allows users, including Supreme Court clerks, to archive a website and provide access to it with a new everlasting URL.
Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg offered no opinion on perma.cc, but addressed linkrot more generally. "The court prefers to cite printed materials rather than materials available only on the Internet, precisely because of their transient nature," she said.


West Virginia Judge Pleads Guilty
A West Virginia judge pleaded guilty Wednesday to participating in a scheme to conceal alleged illegal drug use and election-law violations by a sheriff who was murdered earlier this year, amid a widening corruption probe in Mingo County.
Michael Thornsbury, 57 years old, who had served as the county's sole circuit judge since 1997, admitted to promising a local businessman a lighter sentence on a drug charge if he hired a new attorney, with the goal of silencing his cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Thornsbury is cooperating with prosecutors in the probe, according to Booth Goodwin, the U.S. attorney in Charleston, W.Va. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, and is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 13.
Mr. Thornsbury was suspended without pay by the West Virginia Supreme Court after he was indicted in August. On Wednesday, he notified West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin of his resignation as circuit judge. Under his plea agreement, Mr. Thornsbury agreed not to contest proceedings to take away his license to practice law, and he agreed not to run for public office again.
As part of his plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop an earlier charge brought in August that Mr. Thornsbury misused his office on several occasions over five years to try to illegally imprison the husband of his former secretary after she ended an affair with him in early 2008. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge.


Dancing With Default
For people who claim that defaulting on U.S. debt is unthinkable, President Obama and Harry Reid are sure behaving as if they can't wait for that day to arrive. Why else are they refusing to take up the multiple Republican offers to guarantee that the U.S. will never default?
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew now says his department can't be sure it will have enough cash to guarantee interest payments after October 17, and he is raising alarms about a default catastrophe. Mr. Obama declared again on Wednesday that he'll only negotiate with Republicans on taxes and spending if they first raise the debt limit without conditions—so dire would the damage from default be to the U.S. economy and reputation.
House GOP leaders also insist they don't want a default, and they've already passed a bill to prevent it—not that the media have paid any attention. First sponsored in 2011 by California Republican Tom McClintock and Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, the Full Faith and Credit Act is essentially an insurance policy against miscalculation. Their bill certifies that U.S. sovereign debt will always be repaid, on time and in full.
If Congress fails to authorize a statutory increase in the debt limit—during a period of, say, intense political conflict over the fisc like the one now—the bill stipulates that Treasury can continue making contractual interest and principal payments to bond holders and rolling over debt with incoming tax payments. Debt service gets the first call on revenue.
The McClintock-Toomey bill replicates the guarantees that state constitutions have had for hundreds of years to strengthen investor confidence. It gives the Treasury Secretary discretion to prioritize among other federal obligations until the political deadlock ends, tempers cool and the parties can reach a deal. But it makes his first priority to protect the full faith and credit of the U.S.


Buono, Christie Tussle Over Taxes, Marijuana and Gay Marriage
The two agreed on few issues in the hour-long debate here at William Paterson University that spanned more than a dozen topics, including gay marriage, the economy, property taxes and superstorm Sandy recovery. The debate aired on CBS in New York.
Mr. Christie was also asked if he was too blunt in his language, and if he planned on running to become the Republican nominee for president in 2016, which he declined to confirm or deny. "I can walk and chew gum at the same time," said Mr. Christie, in response. "I can do this job and also deal with my future and that's exactly what I will do."
Ms. Buono has trailed in polls and in fundraising, and had more at stake in the debate. Political analysts said she scored a few points against Mr. Christie, but seemed scripted and less comfortable than the governor.


Newark's Book of James
Former city Mayor Sharpe James, one of the most colorful and polarizing figures in New Jersey Democratic politics, is returning to some of his old ways.
After an 18-month stint in federal prison on a fraud conviction, Mr. James is back in the city he served for 38 years, armed with a scathing memoir and a growing behind-the-scenes role in Newark politics.
Mr. James is helping his eldest son, John Sharpe James, run a Municipal Council race that the Army National Guard major is favored to win in November.
Last week, Mr. James stunned the city's political establishment in endorsing his longtime foe, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, in his run for an open U.S. Senate in New Jersey.
And those in the crowded field of candidates hoping to succeed Mr. Booker as mayor next year have sought Mr. James's support.


No Longer Prohibited in Staten Island
More than 120 years ago, members of a national temperance organization bought land on Staten Island to create a summer retreat for their movement. The area, a onetime center of the antialcohol cause, gradually shifted from a resort community organized around Prohibition to a traditional neighborhood.
Now known as Westerleigh—a name derived from the Westerleigh Collegiate Institute of Staten Island, once nearby—the community no longer promotes temperance, but it retains the atmosphere of an oasis, with a close-knit population, beloved public park, characteristic single-family Victorian and Dutch Colonial houses and narrow, residential streets. Some streets are still named for prominent Prohibitionists.
"There is a sense of community here that is unique on Staten Island—[people] feel attached to the schools and the churches in the neighborhood," says Michael Morrell, the president of the Westerleigh Improvement Society, a 120-year-old neighborhood advocacy group with 600 members, and a resident of 42 years. "People have been here for generations, so they feel very comfortable talking to their neighbors and their neighbors' children."
Living on Staten Island's North Shore, Westerleigh's residents are a mix of civil servants who work locally and professionals who commute to Manhattan, either via the ferry or on express buses, which travel to Midtown in about an hour. Major roads and highways like Route 440 and Interstate 278 run nearby, offering easy access to other boroughs or New Jersey, but local streets, with few stores, restaurants and offices, can be quieter than nearby areas.
"There's always pressure for development," says Mr. Morrell, whose group has pushed for zoning protections. Areas of Westerleigh were most recently rezoned in 2008, to protect against developers replacing one-family houses with multifamily dwellings that residents feared would overwhelm the neighborhood and threaten its character. Still, Mr. Morrell says, congestion has increased.


Don't Abandon the Sequester
The way the budget showdown is going, Democrats may soon require the Republicans to pay ransom before they'll allow the GOP to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. That's how badly the party's Ted Cruz faction has messed up the politics of all this. But we sure hope part of that price won't be to abandon the budget caps that are the only restraint on President Obama's spending plans.
Democrats hate the spending caps and sequester because they squeeze their pet domestic programs, and two recent reports illustrate how much. The Congressional Budget Office's latest monthly update, for the first 11 months of fiscal 2013 through August, shows that total federal outlays are down $127 billion over the same period last year. This means that when the report comes in for the full fiscal year overall federal spending may have fallen two years in a row for the first time since the end of the Korean War.
Meanwhile, the Congressional Research Service has released a new report that shows the sequester caps are providing better fiscal discipline than any budget deal has since 1980. The report looked at nine major deficit reduction deals and concludes: "In nominal (i.e., not adjusted for inflation) terms, the Budget Control Act achieves the greatest amount of deficit reduction of any act since 1980 over five years, based on the estimates produced near the time of enactment where five year totals are available."
Adjusting for inflation, the report finds that the Budget Control Act's estimated deficit reduction over five years will be second only to the 1990 George H.W. Bush-George Mitchell deal. The Bill Clinton package of 1993 that liberals love came in third.


Another Soda-Tax Squabble
MEXICO CITY—New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken center stage in a heated debate in Mexico over whether to slap a special tax on sugary soft-drinks to help the country curb growing epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
Having been tripped up in his efforts to get New Yorkers to cut back on soda, Mr. Bloomberg has brought his campaign south of the border, where he has backed a government proposal to tax sugary drinks in a country that is a huge market for Coca-Cola Co. and other soft drink companies.
The bill seeks a one peso (eight U.S. cents) tax per liter of soda, part of a wide-ranging tax overhaul proposed by the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto last month. Some Mexican lawmakers are pushing to double the proposed tax to two pesos per liter.
Bloomberg Philanthropies, the umbrella organization for Mr. Bloomberg's charitable activities, has donated $10 million over the past two years toward combating obesity in Mexico under a three-year program. The organization's website lists "raising taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages" as one way to combat obesity in Mexico.
One of Bloomberg's beneficiaries, a group called El Poder del Consumidor, is a leading supporter of the soda tax.


Fear of Deeper Defense Cuts Drives New Budget Talks
The prospect of a deep cut in defense spending scheduled for next year is helping push Republicans and Democrats to look for a new budget deal, but the politics of the 2014 midterm elections could complicate any talks.
In the wake of the just-ended government shutdown, top Republican leaders have told the White House that they are open to rolling back parts of the automatic defense and nondefense spending cuts in any new budget deal. Democrats have broadly supported an easing of the cuts.
In exchange, the GOP leaders say they want reductions in entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, which Democrats say they would only back if a deal raised new revenue, a condition that Republicans oppose.
Still, the GOP overture has created the possibility of a deal if both sides can shake off their recent feuds, according to interviews with congressional aides.


At Last, a Real, Brave Hero In Washington
Thank you for the photo of former Army Captain William D. Swenson receiving the Medal of Honor for bravery on the field of battle and for the reference to his compassion for his fellow combatants (page one, Oct. 16). This recognition of his willingness to personally risk all stood in stark contrast to the headlines next to his photo about Congress and our representatives who demonstrate daily a lack of bravery to personally risk anything.

Indigenous Groups Protest Ecuador Oil-Drilling Plans
QUITO, Ecuador—Leaders of indigenous groups from Ecuador's Amazon region said Monday they won't allow new oil activity in their territories, saying they will go to international courts to block any new drilling.
About 150 indigenous women from the Amazon are in Quito asking to meet with President Rafael Correa and the National Assembly. The women came from the city of Puyo, about 143 miles south of Quito, in a march called the "Mobilization of Women for Life." Mr. Correa had offered to meet with them in the Amazon-region city of Pañacocha, but the women declined.
The group is against oil activity recently approved by the National Assembly in two blocks in the ecologically rich Yasuní national park, as well as any new activity in the Amazon region in general. This includes activity on 16 blocks to be auctioned off in a coming exploration-licensing round. The deadline for offers in this new round is Nov. 28.
"Our rights are being infringed and we are willing to go to all international bodies to make our voice heard," said Patricia Gualinga, a leader of the Sarayacu ethnic group.
The group's march on Quito comes two months after the government backtracked on a promise to not drill in a protected part of the Amazon. In August, the government said it would abandon a plan it announced six years ago to refrain from drilling in the rainforest if the world came up with $3.6 billion to make up for some of the lost revenue. Mr. Correa said only $13 million was raised—money that would be given back to donors.


Doubt Raised in Baby Hope Case
The attorney for Conrado Juarez, the man accused of killing "Baby Hope" more than 22 years ago, said Tuesday that he hasn't seen the alleged videotape confession his client gave during a police interrogation.
Lawyer Michael Croce's comments were made outside Manhattan Criminal Court, where he learned Tuesday that a grand jury voted to indict Mr. Juarez.
That indictment has been sealed until Nov. 21. Mr. Juarez wasn't present at the hearing and has previously pleaded not guilty. He has been held in jail without bail.
Investigators have said that Mr. Juarez confessed to killing 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo—who was known as "Baby Hope" until identified by police earlier this month—on video. But Mr. Croce said his client was interrogated for as many as 14 hours without an attorney present.
"I don't trust any statements that were made by any individual after being in custody for such an extended period of time," Mr. Croce said. He also questioned if Mr. Juarez was allowed to call a family member or attorney during questioning.


For Bergen County Prosecutor, Two Cases Linger
As the top law-enforcement official in Bergen County, N.J., John Molinelli set up the county's first cold-case unit, which went on to solve 18 old homicides.
But as his more than a decade tenure as prosecutor draws to a close, Mr. Molinelli leaves behind two unsolved murders that continue to unnerve county residents.
In 2010, two elderly women were killed several months apart in nearby New Jersey towns, both stabbed before their homes were set on fire in apparent attempts to destroy evidence.
While investigators are pursuing the possibility that the murders are connected, Mr. Molinelli, 56 years old, said authorities have no evidence that links them. And three years later, there are no suspects for either crime, he said.
Now, time is running out for charges to be brought under his watch in the murders of Joan Davis, 74, of Teaneck and Dolores Alliotts, 69, of Palisades Park.


More Law Firms Look Into Mergers
Merger talks between major law firms are heating up this fall, as firms seek strength in numbers to help improve their position in a tough legal market.
Last week Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP—two law firms with San Francisco roots—confirmed discussions about a potential merger that, if completed, would produce a roughly 1,700-lawyer firm with more than $1.4 billion in estimated combined revenue.
The news set tongues wagging in U.S. legal circles after what has been a relatively slow year for big law firm combinations. While a number of splashy cross-border tie-ups were announced last year, recent U.S. law firm combinations have mostly involved bigger or midsize firms acquiring much smaller groups.
Things may be picking up. Last month global firm Dentons and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP said they were in talks, a combination that could boost their head count to more than 3,000 lawyers world-wide. And word of another possible merger, between Patton Boggs LLP and Locke Lord LLP, emerged this weekend, though those talks aren't yet at an advanced stage, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
Still, there is no guarantee any of the talks will result in a union—much less one that improves the fortunes of both sides.


Argentine President Loses Ground
BUENOS AIRES—President Cristina Kirchner appears to have retained her congressional majority in midterm elections on Sunday, but her candidates were trounced in a crucial district, setting the stage for a fight within Argentina's ruling Peronist movement to succeed her.
The president's candidates received more votes nationwide than any other party, according to preliminary election returns from the Interior Ministry.
Nationally, Mrs. Kirchner's Victory Front coalition received almost a third of the vote in the lower house and the Senate.
Mrs. Kirchner's absence added to the gravity of the elections. The 60-year-old president hasn't been seen in public since she had surgery to remove a blood clot near her brain on Oct. 8. Her doctors prescribed 30 days of rest.
But the Victory Front's poor showing in Buenos Aires province where her former cabinet chief Sergio Massa, a current mayor in the province, took the most votes was a blow to the president.


Record Spent on New Jersey Campaigns
New Jersey state Sen. Barbara Buono, a Democrat, has trailed Republican Chris Christie by a wide margin in fundraising for her uphill campaign for governor—but she has benefited, in part, from a record amount of outside political donations flowing into the state in 2013.
Nearly $38 million has been spent on New Jersey's elections from independent expenditure groups through Oct. 30, the most ever in any state election and more than twice the previous record of $15 million in 2009, figures released Thursday by the state Election Law Enforcement Commission showed.
New Jersey ranked sixth in the amount of independent groups spending on any election in the country, behind three contests in California, one in Ohio and one in Florida.
"We already are in the top 10 state races of all time, and the election still isn't over," said Jeff Brindle, executive director of the commission, who called the total spending "mind-boggling."
The fundraising landscape across the country was altered after the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Citizens United case, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts on campaigns.


Contested Amnesty Bill Advances to Let Thai Ex-Leader Return
BANGKOK—Thailand's lower house rushed through a controversial amnesty bill in predawn voting on Friday that would allow former leader Thaksin Shinawatra to return home without serving a prison term.
The bill passed, 310-0, in the 500-seat House, which is dominated by the ruling Pheu Thai Party, after 19 hours of debate. The main opposition party walked out before the vote, which took place just hours after large anti-amnesty street protests.
The bill will be sent to the Senate, though it wasn't immediately clear when it might act. The bill's fate is unclear in the Senate, which is less heavily dominated by the Pheu Thai Party and where several anti-Thaksin senators have vowed to work to defeat it.
The main opposition Democrat Party launched a street rally on Thursday against the bill, which they say is intended only to serve Mr. Thaksin, brother of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and leader of the Pheu Thai party.
"We will fight against the bill until we win," said Sathit Wongnongtoey, a Democrat Party executive. "We must say 'no' to the law that will whitewash [Thaksin's] crimes."


Iraq Blames Violence on Syria War
WASHINGTON—Iraq's prime minister, visiting Washington on Thursday, blamed rising violence in his country on the civil war in Syria and the strength of al Qaeda-aligned groups there.
Nouri al-Maliki said in a speech at the U.S. Institute of Peace that the failure of the Arab Spring revolutions is directly responsible for the rise of violence in Iraq.
"Regretfully, the Arab revolutions were able to shake the dictatorships but weren't able to fill the void in the right way," Mr. Maliki said. "So a vacuum was created, and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations were able to exploit it and to gain ground."
But those views aren't widely shared in Washington some U.S. military officials say al Qaeda's rise in Iraq largely has been fueled by the government's own missteps, and that the militants would be enjoying a resurgence even without the civil war next door.
The prime minister heads a government dominated by Iraq's Shiite majority. But the country's Sunni minority complains of discrimination by Shiite leaders.


India Set to Launch Mars Mission
NEW DELHI—On Tuesday, India's space agency will launch a spacecraft designed to boldly go where no Asian nation has gone before: Mars.
The mission, if successful, would be a technological leap that would propel India ahead of space rivals China and Japan in the field of interplanetary exploration.
It will take more than 10 months for India's Mars satellite, equipped with instruments that can examine the surface of the Red Planet from above, to reach Martian orbit and begin beaming information back to Earth.
"This is a major turning point in our space program--towards exploration," said Koppillil Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, the country's civilian space agency. It will bring "technological advantage for the country."
Decades after the U.S. and Soviet Union battled for supremacy in space during the Cold War, Asian powers have embarked on their own space race—a contest with political, military and technical ramifications here on Earth.


Campaigns Make Dash to the Finish
Bill de Blasio and Joe Lhota campaigned across New York City on Monday—greeting voters at subway stops, schmoozing the lunch crowd at a senior center, trading insults on TV—in a final push a day before the city elects a new mayor for the first time in 12 years.
In this lopsided race, where Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has a staggering lead in the public polls, the final day of campaigning seemed more perfunctory than passionate. But that didn't stop Mr. Lhota, the GOP nominee, from declaring he would shock the city with a come-from-way-behind victory Tuesday.
"I'm seeing a groundswell of support in all five boroughs in the city," said Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a former deputy mayor in Rudy Giuliani's administration, during an interview on MSNBC. "People will be surprised tomorrow. It will be a close race, and I will eke it out."
The winner of Tuesday's election will succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman who has served as the city's chief executive since January 2002. Mr. Bloomberg's third four-year term ends Dec. 31.
At Bay Eden Senior Center in the Bronx, Mr. de Blasio, the city's public advocate and a former City Council member from Brooklyn, shook hands and posed for cell-phone photos. After speaking to the crowd about high water bills and other affordability issues, he toured the tables to greet individual voters.


Use of 'Allah' Sparks Legal Fight in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—A protestant church in Malaysia's eastern state of Sabah is seeking a declaration from a court that it can buy and use Bahasa Malaysia or Bahasa Indonesia translations of the Bible and other religious materials that refer to the Christian God as "Allah," saying it needs clarity after a court decision and conflicting comments by cabinet ministers.
"The declaration which we are seeking..[is] to once and for all put the matter out of question," said the Rev. Jerry Dusing, the president of the 80-year-old Borneo Evangelical Church in Sabah.
The request from Rev. Dusing isn't academic.
On Oct. 25, customs officials temporarily stopped some 2,000 copies of a Catholic newspaper from being distributed in Sabah. The newspaper, the Herald, is at the center of a court battle being appealed to the federal court, the nation's top court.
The court of appeals ruled on Oct. 14 that the Herald can't use "Allah" in the Bahasa Malaysia editions to refer to the Christian God, saying the word is reserved to Muslims in the predominately Muslim country. The stopped Heralds in Sabah were released after the home ministry concluded they didn't contain the word "Allah."


Nazis, Mr. Gurlitt and the Lost Masterpieces
BERLIN—In the final days of World War II, Dresden art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt packed his family, a supply of firewood and the works of some of the greatest masters of 20th century art into a truck and headed west.
As the Soviet army approached from the east, he drove for two days along bomb-cratered roads into the hill country of northern Bavaria. His destination was a castle called Schloss Aschbach, where the local baron agreed to shelter Mr. Gurlitt's family and his art.
That collection, much of it believed to have been acquired by Mr. Gurlitt in the years he worked as an art dealer for the Nazis, is now at the center of an investigation into the hoard of about 1,400 valuable works discovered in the Munich apartment of Mr. Gurlitt's now-elderly son, Cornelius.
Art historians hail the find as one of the greatest discoveries of lost art since the war. While it has given new hope to the heirs of Jews whose artwork was seized by the Nazis, it has raised uncomfortable questions for Germany and for the close-knit world of European art dealers.
Why have German authorities remained silent about the find for nearly two years? And given Hildebrand Gurlitt's work for the Nazis, how was it possible for his son to auction off works, as he did on at least two occasions, without raising suspicions?


Congo, Rebels to Sign Peace Accord
KAMPALA, Uganda—The Democratic Republic of the Congo is slated on Monday to sign a peace deal with the former fighters of the country's largest rebel group to end their bloody conflict in the country's east, Ugandan officials said Friday.
Ofwono Opondo, a Ugandan government spokesman, said a final peace accord has been drafted to pave the way for the demobilization of the former rebel fighters of M23. The rebels and their top commander, Sultani Makenga, surrendered to the Ugandan military this past week, Ugandan officials said, after Congo government forces drove them from their remaining strongholds near the Ugandan border.
A peace deal would cement the prospect of restoring order to the restive eastern Congo, after 20 months of war that aid groups say has displaced more than two million people from their homes within the country and sent refugees streaming across the border into Uganda and Rwanda.
M23 and the Congolese government in the past have missed several deadlines to sign an accord. The two sides were close to a deal in October, but the talks broke down after the government rejected a blanket amnesty demand.
Uganda has been mediating on-and-off talks between the rebels and the Congolese government since December 2012.


Big Law Mergers Fuel Skepticism
When it comes to law firms, bigger may not always be better.
A wave of legal tie-ups has created a fleet of supersize law firms with offices around the world, and more are in the works this fall.
Partners at cross-border entity Dentons and U.S. firm McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP, for example, are poised to vote on a union that would produce one of the top three global law firms by head count. Recent merger talks between two big U.S. firms—Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP—could lead to the creation of another big player.
But law firms with the urge to merge might check with their clients first.
Some top legal officers at Fortune 100 companies say the consolidation craze leaves them cold. Others remain agnostic, but point out that size or geographic reach is no guarantee of quality. And they caution that megamergers can bring unwelcome distractions that sometimes reduce efficiency, and increase legal bills.


Stephens: Axis of Fantasy vs. Axis of Reality
When the history of the Obama administration's foreign policy is written 20 or so years from now, the career of Wendy Sherman, our chief nuclear negotiator with Iran, will be instructive.
In 1988, the former social worker ran the Washington office of the Dukakis campaign and worked at the Democratic National Committee. That was the year the Massachusetts governorcarried 111 electoral votes to George H.W. Bush's 426. In the mid-1990s, Ms. Sherman was briefly the CEO of something called the Fannie Mae Foundation, supposedly a charity that was shut down a decade later for what the Washington Post called "using tax-exempt contributions to advance corporate interests."
From there it was on to the State Department, where she served as a point person in nuclear negotiations with North Korea and met with Kim Jong Il himself. The late dictator, she testified, was "witty and humorous," "a conceptual thinker," "a quick problem-solver," "smart, engaged, knowledgeable, self-confident." Also a movie buff who loved Michael Jordan highlight videos. A regular guy!
Later Ms. Sherman was to be found working for her former boss as the No. 2 at the Albright-Stonebridge Group before taking the No. 3 spot at the State Department. Ethics scolds might describe the arc of her career as a revolving door between misspending taxpayer dollars in government and mooching off them in the private sector. But it's mainly an example of failing up—the Washingtonian phenomenon of promotion to ever-higher positions of authority and prestige irrespective of past performance.
This administration in particular is stuffed with fail-uppers—the president, the vice president, the secretary of state and the national security adviser, to name a few—and every now and then it shows. Like, for instance, when people for whom the test of real-world results has never meant very much meet people for whom that test means everything.


Odds Lot: Statisticians Party Like It's 2.013 x 10 Cubed
LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, Belgium—When Ingrid van Keilegom tells people she is a statistician, they usually reply fearfully, " 'Oh, no,' " she says. "To them, it sounds like math."
Roughly 88% complete, the year gets a grade of 90% so far from Ron Wasserstein, head of the American Statistical Association and a lead coordinator of Statistics2013, as the 365-day function is known. He tallies up more than 2,250 participating organizations from almost 66% of the world's countries.


Convicted in Brazil Bribery Case Report to Jail
BRASILIA—Defendants in Brazil's biggest ongoing corruption case began reporting for prison terms late Friday, dispelling speculation that the high-profile politicians and bankers convicted a year ago would find legal loopholes to avoid jail time.
Obeying prison orders issued by the Supreme Court, several defendants turned themselves in, including the alleged mastermind, José Dirceu, the ex-chief of staff to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva; and José Genoíno, a former leader of the ruling Workers' Party, or PT.
Both men have denied wrongdoing and remained defiant as they entered the police stations. Mr. Genoíno raised his right fist in the air and shouted "I am innocent" to the television cameras.
In a statement on his blog, Mr. Dirceu, who faces some nine years in jail, said he would comply with the court order but "not without protesting and denouncing the unfair nature of the conviction I received."
Having politicians convicted and sentenced in a corruption case show up for prison isn't all that common in Brazil.


Afghan Leader Jeopardizes Security Pact
Obama administration plans to keep thousands of troops in Afghanistan for years to come were thrust into doubt on Thursday when Afghan President Hamid Karzai unexpectedly called for delaying a long-term security deal until his successor is elected next spring.
The surprise move, which Mr. Karzai announced in a televised address before a special Afghan council that will advise him on the deal, cast a new cloud of uncertainty over the fate of the security pact. The administration warned that failure to complete the agreement by the end of the year could force the U.S. to pull out of Afghanistan altogether in 2014.
Mr. Karzai's remarks came less than 24 hours after Afghan and U.S. leaders ironed out a disagreement over the circumstances when U.S. forces could enter Afghan homes, paving the way for a final agreement after a year of contentious negotiations.
This week, Mr. Karzai during a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry requested a letter from President Barack Obama admitting U.S. "mistakes" in the war and recognizing the suffering inflicted on Afghans by U.S. forces. Mr. Karzai wanted the letter as a condition to dropping his objections to U.S. forces raiding Afghan homes in exceptional circumstances.
Mr. Obama replied with a letter Thursday morning, Mr. Karzai said, but its text—initially released by Kabul—fell far short of the Afghan demands. The letter didn't acknowledge any American mistakes and said the U.S. has redoubled its efforts to ensure that Afghan homes are respected by U.S. forces.


Echoes of Past Rule In Honduras Vote
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras—Former President Manuel Zelaya, removed from power by the military in 2009 and put on a plane to Costa Rica in his pajamas, has a chance to return to the presidential palace in Sunday's national elections, only this time as first husband.
Mr. Zelaya's wife, Xiomara Castro de Zelaya, is neck-and-neck with conservative National Party candidate Juan Orlando Hernández in polls leading up to the vote, which is shaping up as a referendum on Mr. Zelaya and his populist politics, compared with the traditional parties that some see as out of touch.
Mr. Zelaya, widely viewed as close to Venezuela's Hugo Chávez during his 2006 to 2009 presidency, is constitutionally barred from being president again. But many here see him as the real candidate for the Partido Libre, or Free Party, a new coalition of leftist groups that is squaring off against a field of seven other candidates from eight political parties.
The lack of a clear front-runner has raised anxiety in a nation that is divided over Mr. Zelaya's legacy and the events in 2009, when the military rousted the former rancher from bed and sent him into exile, leading to months of protests and years of isolation for the Central American country. The U.S. government called the ouster a "coup."
The military said the move was justified by the fact that Mr. Zelaya was trying to change Honduras' constitution to allow for re-election, stoking fears that he planned to undermine democracy by following Mr. Chavez's playbook in Venezuela. Mr. Chavez changed the constitution several times to allow him to remain in power until his death in March from cancer. Honduras ultimately held elections a few months after the ouster, won by current President Porfirio Lobo.


Shaken NSA Grapples With Overhaul
WASHINGTON—Shortly after former government contractor Edward Snowden revealed himself in June as the source of leaked National Security Agency documents, the agency's director, Gen. Keith Alexander, offered to resign, according to a senior U.S. official.
The offer, which hasn't previously been reported, was declined by the Obama administration. But it shows the degree to which Mr. Snowden's revelations have shaken the NSA's foundations—unlike any event in its six-decade history, including the blowback against domestic spying in the 1970s.
The post-Snowden era has forced a major re-evaluation of NSA operations by the administration and on Capitol Hill, and the review is likely to alter the agency's rules of the road. "It was cataclysmic," Richard Ledgett, who heads a special NSA Snowden response team, said of the disclosures. "This is the hardest problem we've had to face in 62 years of existence."
Broad new controls, though, run the risk of overcorrecting, leaving the agency unable to respond to a future crisis, critics of the expected changes warn.
When the leaks began, some top administration officials found their confidence in Gen. Alexander shaken because he presided over a grave security lapse, a former senior defense official said. But the officials also didn't think his resignation would solve the security problem and were concerned that letting him leave would wrongly hand Mr. Snowden a win, the former defense official said.


After Serious Illness, Many Patients Face Second Recovery
Hospitals are doing more to help the growing number of patients who receive treatment for serious illness in the intensive-care unit—only to find their release is the start of a whole new set of problems.
With medical advances, even the sickest patients now often survive potentially life-threatening conditions after a stay in intensive care. Many experience aftereffects, not only of the illness but also of the very medical care that may have saved their lives.
Doctors call it "post-intensive care syndrome" and say it is becoming more common. In the ICU, patients may be heavily sedated and hooked up to a ventilator, keeping them immobile, breathing and free of pain. But they can develop a temporary brain injury known as "ICU delirium," that is linked to later problems with memory and thinking. As many as 80% of ICU survivors have some form of cognitive or brain dysfunction, according to the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and some never recover. Many experience post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, fatigue and prolonged muscle weakness.
More than five million patients are admitted to an intensive care unit each year for conditions such as respiratory failure and heart failure, and for monitoring after invasive surgery.
Especially at risk of developing post-ICU syndrome are patients who have sepsis. Often referred to as "blood poisoning," sepsis is the body's toxic response to infection and the most common life-threatening illness leading to ICU admission world-wide. It can arise from a seemingly benign cut or scrape, or set in as a complication of pneumonia, urinary tract infection or burst appendix.


50-Room French Castle Asks $17 Million
When Baron Jean-Pierre Potet bought a 50-room, Louis XIII-style château in the French countryside 40 years ago, it was empty. Occupied by German soldiers during World War II, the castle had been looted, with nearly all of its furnishings stolen, Mr. Potet said.
Luckily for him, he said, it was Frenchmen who did the stealing. That meant he's been able to retrieve nearly all of the castle's furnishings by trolling antique stores in the area, using old photos as a guide. The castle, where Mr. Potet lives with his wife Corinne and their two children, now looks much as it did a century ago, he said.
Château de Villersexel is in northeast France, near the Swiss border. For centuries, it had been the seat of the Grammonts, a noble French family. The castle was destroyed twice, Mr. Potet said: once around the year 1,000, and again in the Battle of Villersexel in 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War. During World War II, the Marquis de Grammont took part in the French Resistance, ultimately dying in the concentration camp at Dachau, according to Mr. Potet (who can trace his family line back to Charlemagne, but is no relation to the Grammonts). After the war, with the Germans gone, the castle was abandoned and ripe for looting, he said.
One of the founders of the L'Ecole des Métiers de la Communication, a graduate school with locations throughout the world, Mr. Potet purchased the castle from the Grammont family in 1976 for an undisclosed sum. At the time, he said, he "wanted to run away from Paris" and was looking for a simpler life. Now he says he's selling because he wants a smaller place.


On the Launch Pad
Space Exploration Technologies Corp. aborted two launches, one within seconds of liftoff, of its first commercial satellite in space Thursday.
Space X, as the Southern California company is known, aborted the launches at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for technical reasons.
An upgraded Falcon 9 rocket will eventually lift a three-ton communications satellite owned by SES SA of Luxembourg into high-earth orbit, shaking up the global launch market long dominated by larger American, Russian and European players.
SpaceX already has a total of more than four dozen launches on its manifest through 2018, including 10 cargo deliveries to the international space station on behalf of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
But this launch is the first essential step to demonstrate the Falcon 9's reliability to place big satellites into much higher orbits, which allows them to effectively hover at roughly the same spot above the earth while approximately 22,000 miles high.


U.S. Airlines Advised to Comply With China Defense Zone
The Federal Aviation Administration has advised U.S. commercial airlines to abide by China's newly declared air-defense zone in the East China Sea, Obama administration officials said.
The officials said the decision to advise carriers to comply with Chinese demands was made out of an abundance of caution to avoid any possible miscommunications. The decision is consistent with the FAA's standard operating procedure, the officials said.
The State Department on Friday said that it "generally expects" carriers to operate consistent with notices such as the one put out by China about the establishment of the new zone.
But administration officials said this has no effect on the U.S. position that the Chinese defense zone is illegitimate—and wouldn't affect U.S. military flights that are being made into the zone without notice to China.
"Any communications with airlines has no bearing on our strong stance about this concerning development," one of the officials said, referring to the U.S. government's decision not to recognize China's air defense zone.


Showdown on Tuition for the Disabled
Three years ago, Alexia Ricardo wanted to send her daughter to public school in New York City. But the nation's largest school district said it didn't have an appropriate place for her learning-disabled daughter. Ms. Ricardo, who was making about $13,000 a year at the time, did what she thought was best: She signed her daughter up for private school and filed with the city to request tuition payments.
In a lengthy legal fight that landed in federal court, the school system pushed back, and the two sides found themselves in a murky region of the law that is becoming increasingly problematic for parents and school districts alike.
The city argued that Ms. Ricardo acted in bad faith and never intended to send her daughter to public school. The city said she couldn't possibly pay the tuition to the Cooke Center for Learning and Development, a private school in Manhattan that cost $44,500 a year, because she was too poor.
More parents in New York state are enrolling their children with special needs in private schools and seeking taxpayer-funded tuition payments under a federal law. New York City, for example, will spend an estimated $223 million in 2013-14 on private-school tuition, up from about $63 million in the 2007-08 school year, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.
As the numbers climb, districts are balking. And who is right isn't always clear.


House, Senate Negotiators Announce Budget Deal
House and Senate negotiators, in a rare bipartisan act, announced a budget agreement Tuesday designed to avert another economy-rattling government shutdown and to bring a dose of stability to Congress's fiscal policy-making over the next two years.
Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), who struck the deal after weeks of private talks, said it would allow more spending for domestic and defense programs in the near term, while adopting deficit-reduction measures over a decade to offset the costs.
Revenues to fund the higher spending would come from changes to federal employee and military pension programs, and higher fees for airline passengers, among other sources. An extension of long-term jobless benefits, sought by Democrats, wasn't included.
The plan is modest in scope, compared with past budget deals and to once-grand ambitions in Congress to craft a "grand bargain" to restructure the tax code and federal entitlement programs. But in a year and an institution characterized by gridlock and partisanship, lawmakers were relieved they could reach even a minimal agreement.
"In divided government, you don't always get what you want," said Mr. Ryan in announcing the deal.


Foreign Pilots Face More Snags in Landing in San Francisco
Foreign airline crews experienced problems approaching San Francisco International Airport at a greater rate than U.S. pilots when the airport's landing guidance system was impaired, a Wall Street Journal analysis of government data found.
The findings, based on nearly 100,000 flights coming into the busy hub over six months, come as federal investigators held their first public hearing Wednesday on the crash last summer of an Asiana Airlines Co. jet in which three people died and 180 were injured. The pilots' undue reliance on automated flight systems has emerged as a key factor in that crash.
Asiana, based in South Korea, had the highest rate during the system outage of any carrier serving San Francisco for "go-arounds"—approaches broken off at low altitude before touchdown—the Journal found.
In July, an Asiana Boeing Co. 777, flying dangerously slow and low into San Francisco, slammed its tail into a seawall in front of its intended runway. Investigators of the crash are focusing on pilot confusion about automated thrust settings, coupled with the cockpit crew's failure to properly monitor the jetliner's speed and trajectory during the visual approach in good weather.
At its public hearing, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed Wednesday that the commander of the Asiana jet failed to respond to as many as four verbal warnings from a co-pilot that the aircraft was descending too quickly shortly before impact. The pilot flying the approach told investigators afterward he had been "very concerned" about executing the approach to San Francisco without precise vertical guidance.


Jury Convicts in Wine Scam
A California man was convicted Wednesday in Manhattan federal court in connection with his efforts to concoct and sell counterfeit wine after a trial that included testimony from a billionaire connoisseur and a trio of vineyard proprietors from France.
The seven-day trial of Rudy Kurniawan, 37 years old, of Arcadia, Calif., had plumbed the shadowy world of wine counterfeiting, where old bottles and old corks are used to make wine look well-aged—and expensive.
Mr. Kurniawan faces up to 20 years in prison on counts of mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with the scheme to manufacture and sell the phony vintages. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman set a sentencing date of April 24. Mr. Kurniawan also faces deportation to his native Indonesia.
Mr. Kurniawan sat motionless in the courtroom as the verdicts were read while his attorney, Jerome Mooney, patted him on the shoulder. The jury took two hours to return its decision. Mr. Mooney said the verdict disappointed him. He added he believed the defense had exposed a dirty secret in the rare-wine world, a "don't ask, don't tell mentality within the industry as to the authenticity of wine."
Prosecutors had charged that inside Mr. Kurniawan's suburban California home, he affixed forged labels of rare, pricey vintages on old bottles and filled them with masterfully mixed blends of cheaper wines. He sold millions of dollars of phony wine to friends and others victims, some of which he bragged came from a "magic cellar" in Europe, prosecutor Jason Hernandez said in opening statements.


Obama Issues Veto Threat on Iran Bill
WASHINGTON—The White House issued a rare veto threat in response to a bipartisan Senate bill that would slap Iran with new sanctions if it violates an interim deal reached last month to curb its nuclear program.
The threat sets up a standoff in the new year between President Barack Obama and more than two dozen Senate Democrats and Republicans who introduced the legislation on Thursday. The challenge to Mr. Obama is particularly stark because half of the lawmakers sponsoring the new bill are from his own party.
The bill could also imperil Mr. Obama's efforts to reach a diplomatic end to the decadelong standoff over Iran's nuclear program, which administration officials hope will be a signature achievement of his second term.
Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened in recent days to back out of negotiations with the U.S. and other global powers over Tehran's nuclear program if Washington enacts new sanctions.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney criticized the Senate move, saying such sanctions would undermine Mr. Obama's diplomatic efforts "no matter how they're structured."


Brazil Rains Cause at Least 22 Deaths
SÃO PAULO—Unusually heavy rains in southeastern Brazil have killed at least 22 people and left many tens of thousands homeless.
Hardest hit have been the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, with 16 and 6 confirmed deaths, respectively. More than 46,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Espirito Santo, and more than 700 are homeless in Minas Gerais, according to their state governments, with more than 5,000 of the total seeking refuge in state shelters.
Espirito Santo has had the most rainfall since record-taking began 90 years ago, and the state government has declared a state of emergency. Television pictures showed flooding in large areas.
President Dilma Rousseff traveled to Espirito Santo on Tuesday, where she overflew some of the damaged areas by helicopter with State Governor Renato Casagrande, and promised to help all those in need.
"The first thing the federal government will do is rescue people in difficulty," Ms. Rousseff said during a press conference after the visit, adding that she has ordered the armed forces to provide full support for rescue missions. The president's press department distributed a transcript of the conference by email.


City's Inmate Population Declines
The city's inmate population dropped significantly since 2001, while the national rate increased during the same time period, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday.
The rate of city residents who are incarcerated in local and state facilities dropped 36% from 2001 to 2012—from 669 prisoners per 100,000 residents to 448 per 100,000 residents, Mr. Bloomberg said. The city's overall population increased roughly 1 million during that time, officials said.
The national rate of incarceration from 2001 to 2012 grew by 3%—from 622 inmates per 100,000 people to 641 per 100,000 people, the mayor said, citing the federal statistics.
The drop includes the number of inmates from the city serving sentences in state prisons, which fell from 41,880 in 2001 to 25,316 in 2012. The number of inmates in city jails fell from 14,490 to 11,827 over roughly the same period.
The decrease was credited in part to prosecutors, judges and correction department officials using community-based alternative programs designed to keep defendants out of jail or keep them from returning to prison, city officials said.


For Bloomberg, an Awkward Day
Wednesday was Michael Bloomberg's first day out of office, and it began with a chance encounter with his successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Mr. Bloomberg, en route to the inauguration from his home on the Upper East Side, was emerging from the downtown City Hall station train platform with girlfriend Diana Taylor and an aide when he ran into Mr. de Blasio and his family, who arrived on a No. 4 train from Brooklyn. The men exchanged pleasantries before heading to the inauguration separately.
So it went on an awkward day for Mr. Bloomberg, who sat through a more than hour-long ceremony marked by harsh words about his 12-year tenure.
Mr. Bloomberg was stoic as actor and activist Harry Belafonte decried the stop-and-frisk police tactic defended by Mr. Bloomberg and referred to the city as a "community divided."
"He would no longer let this city linger in the shadows as a parallel story to Charles Dickinson's 'A Tale of Two Cities,'" Mr. Belafonte said of Mr. de Blasio.


Former Miss Venezuela Shot to Death
CARACAS, Venezuela—A former Venezuelan beauty queen and her partner were found shot to death in their car after an apparently botched highway robbery, authorities said Tuesday, putting a spotlight on the South American country's battle with rampant street crime.
The couple's 5-year-old daughter suffered a gunshot to the leg, but survived and was in the hospital, officials said.
The news comes amid growing debate over the government's efforts at tackling one of the region's worst crime rates and the dearth of statistics that officials disclose. The government insists the number of murders dropped last year, while nonprofit groups say they have risen to historic highs.
It is yet another challenge for President Nicolás Maduro, who in recent months has concentrated on solving the oil-rich nation's mounting economic woes, which includes the highest inflation rate in the Americas.
Mónica Spear, 29 years old, and Thomas Henry Berry, 39, were killed Monday night off a highway 125 miles from the capital, as they waited for a tow truck after their car was damaged by a pothole, José Gregorio Sierralta, director of the national investigative division Cicpc, said in televised comments.


Testimony in Assemblyman's Bribery Trial Continues
Bronx state Assemblyman Eric Stevenson offered to secure $50,000 in state funds for adult day-care centers in exchange for a kickback of half of the money, according to testimony in his corruption trial Wednesday.
Over breakfast at a Bronx diner, Sigfredo Gonzalez, who worked for several prominent New York politicians, recorded a conversation with Mr. Stevenson on Dec. 27, 2012, as part of his yearlong role as a government informant, he said during testimony in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
After eating, Mr. Gonzalez offered to take Mr. Stevenson to a meeting with state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, he testified. As they drove, the two discussed legislation that prosecutors said Mr. Stevenson agreed to draft in exchange for a $10,000 bribe from Mr. Gonzalez's Russian business partners.
That proposed bill called for a moratorium on any future adult day-care centers from being built in New York City—but allowed existing owners to expand, prosecutors said.
Mr. Stevenson, 47 years old, then changed the subject and said something unintelligible on the recording, followed by: "I give 50,000."


Indonesia's Watered-Down Ban on Ore Exports Takes Effect
JAKARTA, Indonesia—Indonesia's long-awaited ban on the export of mineral ores went into effect Sunday, but only after last-minute meetings left room for major exceptions as the government balances domestic political pressure with economic reality.
Energy Minister Jero Wacik told reporters late Saturday following a meeting of ministers that the export of mineral ores is no longer allowed, as required by a 2009 law "to enhance the value" of Indonesia's giant mining industry.
He said, however, that companies "that have been processing and will process their minerals" in Indonesia will be allowed to continue operations. He said details would emerge in coming days.
That statement squares with comments last week by R. Sukhyar, the ministry's director general for coal and minerals, that companies with clear plans to process ores domestically would be allowed to continue exporting unprocessed minerals as long as their plans, such as building smelters, are progressing.
Mr. Wacik's suggestion of exceptions likely means immediate change isn't in store for dozens of major mining companies, many of whom have broken ground, if tentatively, on processing plants. Currently, only a small amount of the ore mined in Indonesia is refined here.


BP Payments May Continue to Flow
BP PLC has argued for months in federal court and high-profile newspaper ads that the oil-spill settlement it signed in 2012 should be scrapped if what it believed to be fraudulent payments continued. But the company lost that option late Friday when the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the existing framework for reviewing claims and disbursing funds.
The ruling narrows BP's options for avoiding what it says are millions of dollars in payments to individuals and business not harmed by the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
A BP spokesman said the decision still leaves open the question of whether court-appointed administrator Patrick Juneau is interpreting the settlement accurately—an issue BP has raised with another set of Fifth Circuit judges that is pending.
The company contends Mr. Juneau is ignoring language in the settlement requiring proof that a claimant actually was damaged by the Deepwater Horizon spill, which it says has allowed widespread fraud. Mr. Juneau has said he is interpreting the settlement correctly.
"The company will continue to press its position on the agreement's threshold requirement that claimants' losses must be traceable to the spill," spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement.


Protesters Shut Down Parts of Bangkok
BANGKOK—Antigovernment protesters blocked off many of the roads leading to the commercial and business core of Thailand's capital on Monday, in their latest bid to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office and scuttle elections scheduled for Feb. 2.
The scene in the center of the city resembled a lazy Sunday rather than a rush-hour Monday. Demonstrators blocked off a series of intersections around the city, shutting the flow of traffic into the area, which includes some of Bangkok's busiest shopping hubs. Many commuters opted to take public buses or the city's rail links to get to work, while others chose to ride passenger ferries along a canal that bisects Bangkok.
Some offices closed for the day, along with many schools and colleges, though trading on the country's stock exchange opened as usual.
Authorities on Sunday issued an order prohibiting protesters from blockading Bangkok, a possible prelude to stepping up security measures, but protesters had occupied some areas by Sunday evening and showed no sign of leaving Monday.
Tensions have been building in the run-up to what protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban has billed a final showdown to drive out Ms. Yingluck and to install a nonelected government to carry out what he said are needed political overhauls. That is necessary, he said, to eradicate a pattern of corruption and vote-buying from Thai politics before another election can be held.


Christie Aides Pressed Hard for Endorsements
New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie's ability to secure Democratic endorsements supported his overwhelming re-election last year and helped establish him as a 2016 presidential contender, but now a traffic scandal has put the spotlight on his campaign's tactics with local officials across the state.
Interviews with mayors and other New Jersey Democratic officials show that Mr. Christie's allies in conversations that swung from friendly to persistent fostered a perception of better access to the governor's office and state commissions for those who cooperated, while a few who stayed neutral or endorsed Mr. Christie's opponent said they felt locked out. Others suffered no harm.
One question is whether carrot-and-stick political tactics by Christie aides played a role in a traffic scandal allegedly engineered as a political punishment for a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse the governor.
State lawmakers and federal prosecutors are seeking to untangle the facts behind days of lane closures in September that stalled traffic for hours on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, which links commuters with Manhattan. State officials initially said the lane closure was part of a traffic study.
New Jersey lawmakers will decide this week whether to reauthorize subpoena power for the investigation, and more subpoenas could be issued to Mr. Christie's staff as early as Monday.


Yale to Set Up Faculty Senate
Yale University is in the process of forming a faculty senate—one of the last schools among what it considers its top-notch national peers to do so—as college faculty and administrators across the country clash over issues such as online courses, overseas investments, pay and rising student debt.
Yale President Peter Salovey is forming a committee to design a faculty senate, a month after members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to establish an elected governing body. The committee is expected to propose its plan by the end of the year.
Compared with a group of nine peers including the University of Chicago, University of California, Berkeley and Duke University, Yale is a "considerable outlier in terms of faculty governance," according to a 2013 report by a faculty committee. While the "town-meeting" method of governance remains at Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, other schools have modernized their systems of governance, according to the report.
This change comes at a time when technology, lackluster job markets and high costs are pressing universities and colleges to re-examine how they do business.
"There are all these momentous changes going on, and yet we don't have faculty voice structure in place," said Seyla Benhabib, a Yale professor of political science and philosophy.


South Sudan Leader Enlists Uganda for Battle
JUBA, South Sudan—The president of South Sudan on Thursday said Ugandan troops are bolstering his fight against a political foe, as partners with a stake in this oil-rich nation back his push to gain leverage in peace talks through battlefield gains.
"I as the head of this government requested them to assist," Salva Kiir told The Wall Street Journal in an interview at his offices in the capital, the first he has granted since shortly after the fighting began in December.
A month of fighting has left the impoverished 21⁄2-year-old country in chaos and a U.S.-backed experiment in African nation-building in peril.
The U.S. has spent more than $600 million here in each of the past two fiscal years, making it South Sudan's biggest bilateral partner. Officials built the first paved highway and coached employees at new ministries. Washington even gave trucks to an anti-cattle-rustling unit.


Pedestrian Killed on Upper West Side
A 26-year-old woman was struck by two vehicles and killed early Sunday morning as she was crossing the street on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, the New York Police Department said.
Samantha Lee, who was near her home when the incident occurred, was crossing 96th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue in the middle of the block, when she was clipped by the driver's side window of an ambulance that was heading west, police said.
Ms. Lee fell face down into the eastbound lane of traffic where she was hit by a car that was travelling east, police said. She was pronounced dead on the scene by responding medics.
Both drivers remained on the scene. An investigation was continuing.
Ms. Lee was one of two pedestrians killed this weekend as a result of traffic accidents. Pedro Santiago was killed Sunday morning following a bike accident in Harlem. Bike deaths are counted as pedestrian deaths, an NYPD spokeswoman said.


Blast Hits Bangkok Protest Site
BANGKOK—At least 28 people were injured after an explosion at an antigovernment rally in Thailand's capital on Sunday, sharply raising fears that the country is entering a worsening cycle of political violence.
The early afternoon blast at a protest stage at the Victory Monument landmark came after a grenade blast on Friday that killed one person and injured 37 others. Police officials said security cameras in the area filmed the suspect in Sunday's attack, and said the grenade used was similar to that used in Friday's blast. The Bangkok city government's emergency-response unit said seven of Sunday's victims were reported as suffering severe injuries.
The attacks are deepening political divides in Thailand, one of Southeast Asia's most important economies and a major exporter of products that include automobiles, agricultural produce and hard disk drives.
The country already is badly polarized. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra says she is the country's democratically elected leader, and aims to secure a fresh mandate in snap elections she called for Feb. 2. But protesters led by Suthep Thaugsuban say Ms. Yingluck is a puppet of her elder brother, telecommunications mogul Thaksin Shinawatra, who ran Thailand until a military coup ousted him in 2006 and who now lives overseas to escape conviction on a corruption conviction he considers politically motivated.
For the past week, tens of thousands of demonstrators have stepped up their campaign against the government by attempting to seal off the center of the Thai capital in an operation they dub the "Bangkok Shutdown." They want Ms. Yingluck to step aside and allow an unelected people's council to take over and introduce new checks and balances to limit the power of the Shinawatra clan and their popular, pro-poor policies.


Access to Aid Is Weapon of Syria Warfare
DAMASCUS, Syria—Dozens of emergency-aid workers waited hours this weekend for government permission to evacuate hundreds of children, elderly and the sick from among tens of thousands of residents trapped with little food and medicine in a rebel-held neighborhood here sealed off by regime forces.
A clutch of women, some on stretchers, finally emerged from behind battle-scarred buildings. "Let everyone out. We are eating cat and donkey meat, have mercy on us," said 45-year-old Qamar Azeema, who collapsed in tears. She and 26 others were allowed to leave the Yarmouk Camp district on Sunday.
The long-awaited diplomatic summit in Geneva that begins on Wednesday will likely focus on ways to alleviate Syria's continuing humanitarian disaster: the civil war's toll on civilian men, women and children.


Oh Rats! If It's January, It Must Be Time to Toss Rodents
EL PUIG, Spain—There's no spectacle in the world quite like this tiny town's San Pedro Nolasco fiesta. Every year on the last Sunday in January, townsfolk serve up rice, beans and turnips from steaming caldrons. Dancers whirl about in flowing dresses. Then comes the moment of truth: the throwing of the rats.
The custom's origins are obscure, but revelers have been slinging dead rats at each other on San Pedro's day for about as long as anyone can remember.
Despite animal-rights activists' objections to the practice, locals last year once again threw caution to the wind—along with rodents. "Rats! Rats! We want rats!" went the timeless chant from the crowd. And sure enough, they got them.
"In El Puig, they say you aren't a man until you pick up a rat during San Pedro Nolasco's fiesta and heave it with all your might," said Abel Flores, 18 years old, who made this rite of passage last year. Outsiders may disapprove, but Mr. Flores said he's confident that the tradition will continue this Sunday, and the air will once again be full of laughter and long-tailed mammals.
When it comes to fiestas, Spaniards have an abiding respect for the past, and the sillier the tradition, the more tenaciously they cling to it. "The most serious and reasonable people, such as the Spaniards, are the craziest when it comes to having fun," wrote Antoine de Brunel, a French nobleman visiting Spain in the 17th century. Some Spanish festivals, such as the running of the bulls in Pamplona or la tomatina, or tomato fight, in Buñol, have become known around the world.


France's Hollande, Partner Separate
PARIS—French President François Hollande said Saturday he was separating from his partner of eight years, Valerie Trierweiler, two weeks after a tabloid magazine alleged he was having a relationship with an actress.
"I am letting you know that I am ending my relationship with Ms. Trierweiler," Mr. Hollande told French press agency Agence France-Presse, noting that he was speaking as a private citizen because the announcement concerned his private life. A spokeswoman for the French presidency confirmed that the statement was genuine.
Ms. Trierweiler and Patrice Biancone, her chief of staff, weren't immediately available for comment. Ms. Trierweiler had previously announced plans to travel to Mumbai on Sunday with a charity.
On Jan. 10, Closer magazine published a seven-page report alleging that Mr. Hollande was having an affair with 41-year-old French actress Julie Gayet. It ran pictures of what it said was the president wearing a motorcycle helmet, purportedly arriving via scooter at an apartment nearby the Élysée Palace.
Ms. Gayet hasn't commented on the tabloid report. Last March she filed a complaint with Paris prosecutors about rumors circulating on the Internet, denying the gossip through her lawyer.


North Dakota Reacts to Drilling Critics
North Dakotans have strongly backed oil drilling in their state, but attempts to drill wells near historic sites—including a ranch once used by Teddy Roosevelt—have sparked enough of an outcry that regulators are considering greater citizen input into how and where companies may operate.
Last week, North Dakota's Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil industry, highlighted 18 areas for possible protection because of their cultural, recreational, scenic or spiritual significance. Within a buffer zone, drilling wouldn't be banned but be subjected to heightened public and possibly regulatory scrutiny.
On Wednesday, a panel studying the issue is set to recommend policies on how to give the public more voice in where drilling is allowed, among other issues.
The furor over historical sites was sparked in January 2013 when the Industrial Commission dismissed objections from nearby landowners and Native Americans and approved Hess Corp.'s application to drill wells near the Killdeer Mountains. The wells would be close to the site of a Civil War-era battle involving the U.S. Army and Native Americans and an area considered sacred by local tribes.
The controversy deepened last spring when Exxon Mobil Corp. -owned XTO Energy Inc. planned to drill wells several hundred feet from the Elkhorn Ranch, once used by President Roosevelt, on the Little Missouri River. Amid protests, the company revised its plan to drill two miles away.


Homeowners Upset by Connecticut's Denial of Sandy Aid
Homeowners up and down Connecticut's coast had been counting on grant money from the U.S. government to help them rebuild after superstorm Sandy. They needed the money to raise their houses to guard against future natural disasters.
So when they learned last week that the state unilaterally rejected all 94 homeowner applications for the $16.6 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they were stunned and confused. Then, many simply became angry.
A committee of public officials decided to spend the taxpayer dollars on storm infrastructure projects for shore towns instead. Now, rather than being reimbursed as much as 75% of their construction costs, the homeowners are going to have to find the funds somewhere else.
"It just doesn't seem right," said Michael Greene, 42 years old, who found out Friday that he won't be getting any FEMA aid to defray the roughly $200,000 expense of repairing and elevating his house in Milford, Conn. "Here we have a federal system that is supposed to help people and here is just a breakdown in the system."
For the $16.6 million FEMA grant, the state received $81.6 million in requests from the homeowners, towns and state agencies, said Scott Devico, a spokesman for the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.


Immigration Breakout
President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night got the headlines, but few of his proposals will pass and most would make inequality worse by hurting economic growth. The bigger news this week turns out to be in Congress, where House Republicans seem poised for a political breakout on immigration.
The most important reason to reform immigration laws is to promote economic growth and prosperity. The U.S. has long had a generous immigration system, but it has been skewed to family unification rather than U.S. economic interests. A smarter immigration system would follow the model of Canada and put a higher priority on keeping the best and brightest.
The same principle applies to lower-skilled workers who can help fill the labor shortages in many parts of the country. Agriculture is among the worst off, and millions of crop acres go fallow or are left to rot due to too few farm workers. The current farm-visa program is such a bureaucratic morass that almost nobody uses it, and the gap is filled with workers who have fake documents.


White House Set to Name Pentagon's No. 2
WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is planning to name Robert Work, a retired U.S. Marine and a former top Navy official, to serve as the deputy defense secretary, the No. 2 job at the Pentagon, a U.S. official said.
The White House is expected to announce the nomination Wednesday. Christine Fox has been serving as acting deputy defense secretary since Ashton Carter stepped down in December.
Mr. Work served 27 years in the Marine Corps, retiring as a colonel in 2001. He became undersecretary of the Navy in 2009, serving as a civilian until he left last year.
The deputy Defense secretary, also a civilian post, oversees the business of the Pentagon, shepherding decisions on weapons programs and overseeing budget work. Mr. Work's impending nomination was first reported Tuesday by Bloomberg News.
If confirmed by the Senate as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's deputy, Mr. Work would have to contend with reduced defense budgets in coming years, but has had relevant experience from his previous posts, defense analysts said.


Spanish Princess Questioned in Probe
MADRID—The younger daughter of Spanish King Juan Carlos defended herself Saturday against tax-fraud and money-laundering allegations during the first questioning of one of the country's royals by a judge since the monarchy was restored in 1975.
As protesters opposed to the monarchy gathered amid hundreds of onlookers outside the courthouse, Princess Cristina de Borbón submitted to six hours of questioning by Investigative Judge José Castro and prosecutors behind closed doors. She declined to respond to questions from private plaintiffs in the case.
The judge is investigating whether the 48-year-old princess and her husband, Iñaki Urdangarín, channeled funds from his not-for-profit sports-events consultancy through a jointly owned asset-management firm to pay for lavish parties and other personal expenses—allegations that have stirred public discontent with the royal family.
She testified repeatedly that she hadn't committed any wrongdoing and that she took no part in the day-to-day activities of the consultancy, according to lawyers present at the deposition.
Neither the princess nor Mr. Urdangarín, the main target of the investigation, has been charged with a crime. They have been formally declared to be suspects and could remain so until a decision by Judge Castro, expected within weeks, whether to proceed with a trial. Lawyers for both—they have separate legal teams—say they are innocent of any wrongdoing.


Italian Marines Won't Face Death Penalty
NEW DELHI—Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty in the case of two Italian marines held in the killing of two Indian fishermen in 2012, a spokesman for India's Home Ministry said.
The decision could help ease tensions between India and Italy, which says the marines, who were serving as guards on an Italian tanker, mistook the Indians for pirates and fired warning shots.
Kuldeep Dhatwalia, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, said the marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, would be charged under antipiracy laws but wouldn't face capital punishment.
Mr. Dhatwalia said the marines would likely face a maximum of 10 years in prison.
The case has highlighted the lack of internationally accepted laws for use of force by armed guards aboard vessels, and Italy and India have been locked in a dispute over where the men should be tried.


The Taxman Loseth
The Obama Administration has treated the IRS as a regulatory errand boy, and on Tuesday a federal appeals court struck down one of its more egregious examples of overreach.
In 2011, the IRS decided to crack down on those dastardly folks known as independent tax-return preparers, requiring them to pass certification exams and pay annual fees for helping people navigate the U.S. tax code. In Sabina Loving v. Internal Revenue Service, a unanimous three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the rules that would have affected 600,000 to 700,000 tax preparers.
All of this is a welcome and especially timely rebuke for an Administration that seems to believe it can rewrite the law as it pleases whenever it pleases. The media may be asleep, and Congress divided, but at least the courts are still on the job.


FAA Bars Airline Pilots From Personal Use of Electronic Devices in Cockpits
The Federal Aviation Administration issued final regulations barring airline pilots from using laptops, cellphones or other electronic devices for personal reasons while on duty in the cockpit.
The rule, which was released Tuesday and takes effect in two months, mandates prohibitions that were previously called for by Congress and included years ago in a nonbinding advisory document issued by the FAA.
The move also parallels FAA rules issued more than 30 years ago requiring a so-called "sterile cockpit" in which personal discussions and other distractions are banned below certain altitudes.
The FAA said the rule "codifies existing FAA policies and procedures" applying to both cargo and passenger carriers.
In addition, individual airlines have included the issue in updated training curricula.


Russian Support of Assad Upends Peace Talks
GENEVA—Russia upended talks on Syria's civil war Thursday by explicitly rejecting a proposal to begin discussing the possible removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power during any political transition, said a person close to the talks, making a peace deal even more unlikely.
Russian officials made the point on Thursday to their U.S. counterparts and to United Nations negotiator Lakhdar Brahimi on the sidelines of talks here between the Assad regime and the political opposition, the person said.
Although many doubted the talks would yield an end to the war, Russia's position could spell the end of the talks, which have so far achieved only a modest measure of cooperation in providing aid to civilians in the besieged city of Homs. The person close to the talks said he didn't expect Mr. Brahimi to summon the sides back to Geneva for a third round of negotiations.
"If [Brahimi] sees this process as useless, we have every indication from him that he won't continue," said a second person, a Western diplomat, familiar with the talks.


City's First Lady Lobbies Over Lunch
First lady Chirlane McCray championed her husband's plan to increase income taxes on the wealthy to pay for universal prekindergarten at a private lunch Wednesday, ramping up her effort to advance a top campaign issue of Mayor Bill de Blasio.
At the Gramercy home of Lorna Brett Howard, a Democratic backer of both the mayor and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Ms. McCray defended her husband's proposal to tax New Yorkers earning $500,000 or more a year to pay for prekindergarten and after-school programs for middle-school students.
Many of the approximately 30 attendees would be hit with the tax increase.
Ms. McCray, who met her husband at City Hall when they worked in the administration of former Mayor David Dinkins, asked the women to call their state legislators and reach out to their friends to convince lawmakers in Albany to allow the city to raise income taxes.


Across Crimea, a Sudden Militarization
For years, cars passing from mainland Ukraine to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea have driven peacefully over two highways, both lined with rundown Soviet-era buildings. The region has been known for centuries as a summer paradise for Russia's elite and a critical base for its navy.
But people traveling along the roads on Friday were met with a shock: Masked men toting Kalashnikovs had set up a makeshift border and began checking vehicles, as Russian flags flapped in the late-winter wind.
The border posts arose as just one sign of Crimea's sudden descent into a chaotic militarization Friday. The Kremlin has disavowed involvement in the arrival of camouflaged gunmen at the region's parliament, airports and state television network.
The events come as a backlash to the pro-Europe uprising, strongest in the Western half of the country, that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych a week ago and has taken power in Kiev.


Mayor's Allies Press Him on Housing
A coalition of some of the mayor's liberal allies is set to start a campaign Thursday to create more homes for the city's poorest residents, posing an additional challenge for the administration as it develops its own housing plan.
The group, dubbed Real Affordability for All, plans to rally on the steps of City Hall and present a report it says shows a yawning gap in units aimed at residents making less than $41,000 a year for a family of four.
Real Affordability for All, which consists of about 50 tenant groups, anti-poverty advocates and unions, is a type of political group emerging as a powerful force under Mayor Bill de Blasio: activists who can secure meetings with senior administration officials while also being willing to take to the streets. Others in the category are the Working Families Party and labor unions


Three Regents Re-Elected, One Resigns
Some called it a landmark step toward reforming Common Core. To others, it was a big disappointment.
As the New York Board of Regents faces growing criticism of its handling of state education policies, one of its 17 members resigned Monday night--on the eve of the vote in which three fellow members were re-elected.
The former member, James Jackson, will be succeeded by Josephine Finn, an educator and judge from Monticello who was elected along with the three incumbents during a joint session of the Assembly and Senate.
Mr. Jackson didn't respond to requests for comment.
Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who interviewed candidates seeking to challenge Regents incumbents, said the one Regents personnel change would become part of a broader legislative mission to revise the implementation of Common Core, a new set of federal education standards that most states are rolling out.


Police, Protesters Clash in Turkey
ISTANBUL—Two people died as protests grew on Wednesday in several Turkish cities after the funeral of a teenager whose death kicked off the largest antigovernment demonstrations since unrest swept the nation last year.
The clashes are feeding fears the country could plunge into unrest ahead of crucial elections this month and underscore the polarization between supporters and opponents of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He remained defiant, insisting at a rally that the people taking to the streets were subverting democracy.
The office of Istanbul's governor said a fight had erupted between two groups, leaving a 22-year-old man dead, while Turkey's state news agency reported that a police officer died from a tear gas-induced heart attack amid clashes in the eastern province of Tunceli. State media also reported that two offices of the ruling Justice and Development Party had been torched and more than two dozen vehicles vandalized.
Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Istanbul to mark the funeral of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan, who died on Tuesday, nine months after he was hit in the head with a tear-gas canister during June demonstrations against Mr. Erdogan's government. Many chanted demands that the prime minister, who has become entangled in a massive corruption scandal, resign.
Marchers headed toward Istanbul's Taksim Square—the epicenter of last year's demonstrations—but were stopped by security forces, prompting clashes between police and protesters.


Expert Was Needed to Disable Plane Systems
If multiple communication systems aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were manually disabled, as investigators increasingly suspect happened, it would have required detailed knowledge of the long-range Boeing Co. 777's inner workings.
The first loss of the jet's transponder, which communicates the jet's position, speed and call sign to air traffic control radar, would require disabling a circuit breaker above and behind an overhead panel. Pilots rarely, if ever, need to access the circuit breakers, which are reserved for maintenance personnel.
Pulling one specific circuit breaker, which is labeled, would render inoperative both of the 777's transponders, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and bolstered by comments from aviation industry officials and those who have worked with the 777.
Becoming familiar with the 777's systems requires extensive training for pilots and aircraft mechanics alike, experts said. However, considerable technical data on the airplane is also available online in discussion groups or other websites.
Investigators are trying to establish a sequence of events that transpired on the jet, which vanished from radar March 8, most critically the loss of communication.


Mayor Drops Bid to Put Pensions on California Ballot
The mayor of San Jose, Calif., said on Friday that a group he is leading is ending its effort to place a measure on the California ballot this year that would give jurisdictions the power to renegotiate pension benefits with employees in the public sector.
The efforts led by Mayor Chuck Reed, a Democrat, were the subject of a Wall Street Journal story on March 11.
Mr. Reed made the announcement after a state superior court judge in Sacramento on Friday ruled against him and some other local officials in a suit that they filed in February, which challenged the official wording of the proposed initiative used by Attorney General Kamala Harris.
The suit contends that the Democratic attorney general used "false and misleading words and phrases" in a title and summary for the measure that argue for its defeat.
Pending the litigation, Mr. Reed's group had put on hold a drive to gather the 807,000 voter signatures that would be needed by mid-April to qualify the measure for the 2014 ballot. He said Friday that there now wasn't enough time to gather those signatures.


Brown Will Run in New Hampshire
Former Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts said Friday he was preparing to run for a seat in neighboring New Hampshire, likely forcing Democrats to devote money to an additional state as they try to retain their majority in the Senate this fall.
Mr. Brown ended months of speculation Friday by announcing he had launched an exploratory committee to challenge Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The move allows Mr. Brown to raise money and hire staff as he gears up for what promises to be one of the year's marquee contests.
"I am going to stop complaining and get involved," Mr. Brown told an audience in Nashua, N.H., in a speech criticizing President Barack Obama and Democrats who voted for the 2010 health-insurance overhaul.
"A big political wave is about to break in America, and the Obamacare Democrats are on the wrong side of it," he said.
Democrats and rival Republicans immediately branded Mr. Brown, 54 years old, a political opportunist for running in New Hampshire a little more than a year after he lost his re-election bid in Massachusetts. "It takes time to know a state like this," said former state Sen. Jim Rubens, who will face Mr. Brown in the September Republican primary. "You can't respectably serve a state like this without having roots, deep roots, and recent knowledge."


Judge Questions Secrecy of 'No Fly' List
PORTLAND, Ore.—A federal judge grilled the lawyer representing the government in a Monday hearing over the "no fly" antiterrorist watch list, voicing skepticism the program requires secrecy to be effective.
In a showdown over whether constitutional rights are being abused when the government denies travelers access to flights without prior notification, the court repeatedly dismissed government claims that sharing classified evidence with targets would undermine national security.
"The secrecy is diminished once the person is turned away," Judge Anna J. Brown told the government lawyer, Amy Powell. "Arguing the process is necessary to protect that secrecy has no basis. What am I missing?"
The lawsuit before the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Latif v. Holder, was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of 13 plaintiffs, all Muslims, who say they were unfairly denied liberty to travel freely, or to know the reasons the government considers them security risks. They include the cleric of Portland's Masjed As-Saber Islamic Center, Abdirahman Kariye, as well as plaintiffs from nine other U.S. states.
Their attorney, Hina Shamsi, argued against a "policy of zero notice, zero reasons, and zero hearing at which to clear their names." Some of the 13 are U.S. citizens; four have said they were told by federal agents they could come off the no-fly list by agreeing to be informants.


Long-Shot Effort Made to Revive Dream Act
ALBANY—Support for legislation offering public college financial aid to undocumented immigrants appeared to be dying on Thursday, though Democratic Assembly lawmakers were trying to breathe new life into it.
The measure, known as the Dream Act, was narrowly defeated in a vote in the state Senate this week. So on Thursday, the more liberal Assembly sought a different route to passing the bill—packaging it into the state budget.
"We will continue to press in our negotiations to include the Dream Act," said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, the chairwoman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee. "We believe the governor has indicated his support."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who negotiates the state budget with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other legislative leaders, said Wednesday that the Dream Act was part of budget talks.
But on Thursday, the Dream Act wasn't discussed among the governor and leaders, said Sen. Jeffrey D. Klein, the Democratic co-leader of the Senate. And Mr. Cuomo declined to say whether he believes the Dream Act should be included in the state budget, after the Senate's vote. "The Speaker supports the Dream Act. I support the Dream Act. The Senate's position is that they took a vote on the Dream Act, and the Dream Act went down," Mr. Cuomo said.


New Jersey's Chief Justice Urges Bail Change
New Jersey's top judge proposed an overhaul to the state's courts Thursday, saying the current bail system often discriminates against the poor and that criminal trials need to happen far sooner after arrest.
The 120-page document, created over nine months by a committee including judges, prosecutors and advocacy groups, calls for many nonviolent inmates to leave jail before trial without posting money, instead taking part in a "supervised pretrial release." It also says criminal trials for most defendants should be held within one year of indictment. Unlike most states, New Jersey has no strict rule on when trials are held.
The proposed changes drew mixed reactions.


Calif. DMV Probes Potential Data Breach
California's Department of Motor Vehicles is investigating a potential breach of its credit-card-processing systems, in what might be the latest in a string of attacks that have highlighted vulnerabilities in how payment data are handled.
Retailers including discounter Target Corp. , luxury chain Neiman Marcus Group and beauty-supply chain Sally Beauty Holdings Inc. have been attacked. This report stands out because it involves a government agency. "The Department of Motor Vehicles has been alerted by law enforcement authorities to a potential security issue within its credit-card processing services," spokesman Armando Botello said.
MasterCard Inc. said it has alerted banks that issue credit cards about the potential breach.
The investigation comes two months after American Express Co. notified the DMV that it had spotted suspicious activity on credit cards used for agency transactions, two people familiar with the situation said. It wasn't immediately clear if there were cases of fraud on those cards.
The probe is focused on credit cards that were used for online transactions, according to people familiar with the situation. Transactions using debit cards and those made in person appear to be unaffected, they said.


ObamaCare's Latest Legal Challenge
A defining feature of President Obama's second term is his willfulness in defying limits on executive power to suit his political goals, and no more so than with the Affordable Care Act. The judiciary is the last check on those abuses, and this week it will have another opportunity to vindicate the rule of law.
On Tuesday the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear one of the more important legal challenges to ObamaCare's lawless implementation. Unlike the challenge to the individual insurance mandate, Halbig v. Sebelius involves no great questions of constitutional interpretation. The plaintiffs are merely asking the judges to tell the Administration to faithfully execute the plain language of the statute that Congress passed and President Obama signed.
Prior to passage, Democrats were divided over the structure of the exchanges, with liberals favoring a national clearinghouse and moderates state control. The federalists won and conditioned the subsidies on state-based exchanges.
This was no accident. The federal government cannot commandeer the sovereign states under the Constitution, so Democrats created an incentive for Governors to participate voluntarily. If they didn't cooperate by taking the quid of the exchanges, they would deny their constituents the quo of eligibility to claim billions of dollars worth of benefits. The other Democratic goal was to have the states share in the workload of implementation, instead of concentrating everything within HHS.


Turkey Shoots Down Syrian Warplane
ISTANBUL—Turkey downed a Syrian warplane on Sunday for breaching its airspace, escalating tensions along the border as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged to take a tougher stance against President Bashar al-Assad a week before Turkish elections.
Shortly after lunchtime, a Turkish F-16 downed a Syrian MIG-23 with a missile after it failed to heed four warnings to reverse course and cruised slightly inside Turkish airspace, the armed forces in Ankara said.
The jet was shot while still in Syrian territory, just south of Turkey's border, reflecting Ankara's commitment to enforcing aggressive engagement rules adopted after Mr. Assad's commanders downed a Turkish reconnaissance plane in June 2012.
Turkish television showed images of the plummeting jet, the first time Turkey has downed a Syrian jet since the Syrian uprising began more than three years ago. Damascus said its pilot ejected before the plane crashed.
"If you breach my airspace, our slap will be heavy handed," Mr. Erdogan told thousands of flag-waving supporters in Kocaeli Sunday, when he announced the downing of the jet.


Governor, Mayor Clash on Homeless
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's pledge to combat record numbers of homeless people appeared to hit a significant roadblock Monday, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration suggesting city officials have run out of time to get state money for a new program.
With the city's homeless population surging past 52,000 people a night for the first time, Mr. de Blasio had promised to seek state funding to help people leaving homeless shelters pay rent in independent apartments. A similar program had been cut in 2011, and the number of homeless shelter residents have risen ever since.
City officials said they have pushed Mr. Cuomo's office for a change in state budget language to allow for state funding of a rent-subsidy program—with the details to be worked out later. But Cuomo administration officials said the city didn't present a formal plan for funding a program, as the state wanted, and didn't schedule a face-to-face meeting on the issue.
Instead, the mayor's proposal to increase city income taxes on the wealthy to pay for free, full-day prekindergarten and after-school programs for middle school students has dominated the city's agenda in the state capital. A budget agreement between Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers must be reached by next Tuesday.
"As everyone knows, the budget is due in less than a week so we assume the city's proposal will be for next year because at this point it's too late to take up anything significant this year," said Mr. Cuomo's communications director, Melissa DeRosa.


Bangkok Faces Fresh Protests
BANGKOK—Antigovernment protesters are taking to the streets again in Thailand on Saturday, in a bid to thwart Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's plans to hold fresh elections and resolve months of political deadlock.
Thailand's Constitutional Court last week annulled the Feb. 2 elections, which were disrupted by demonstrators—led by former Deputy Premier Suthep Thaugsuban—who prevented candidates from registering in a number of districts. With the government now lobbying the country's election commission to hold a fresh vote sooner rather than later, Mr. Suthep and about 70,000 supporters marched through Bangkok's bustling commercial hub to rally at a plaza in the city's old quarter.
The turnout, which is according to a midafternoon police estimate, was the largest in recent weeks. The protesters, who at one time were massed at multiple locations, relocated in early February to a single site in Bangkok's Lumpini Park as their numbers dwindled.
Saturday's rally was largely peaceful. A grenade exploded as the protesters passed the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, damaging two cars, but no one was injured, the police said.
Around noon, a small group of protesters briefly occupied the compound of Government House, Ms. Yingluck's main offices, but didn't enter any building. Ms. Yingluck and her cabinet haven't used the offices in months due to the protests nearby.


The Definition of Insanity
Every time a mass shooting happens in the U.S.—Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Aurora—we have the same national discussion: Why can't we identify and treat the dangerously mentally ill before they kill? Here is one infuriating answer.
Inside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sits an agency whose assignment since its creation in 1992 has been to reduce the impact of mental illness and target services to the "people most in need." Instead the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, known as Samhsa, uses its $3.6 billion annual budget to undermine treatment for severe mental disorders.
Health professionals agree on the need to provide medical intervention for serious psychiatric disorders—schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression. The National Institute of Mental Health does evidence-based research and promotes medically driven models of care, including early intervention, intense psychiatric treatment and drugs. Doctors have promoted reforms such as "need for treatment" standards in civil-commitment laws, or assisted-outpatient laws so courts can require the mentally ill to receive treatment to avoid hospitalization. These reforms help the mentally ill and reduce crime, incarceration and homelessness.
Instead of being part of this solution, Samhsa is in the vanguard of the legal-advocacy and anti-psychiatry movement that sprang to life in the 1980s, and it continues to waste taxpayer dollars on programs that undercut efforts to help the world's Adam Lanzas.
Known generally as the "consumer/survivor" movement (as in having "survived" psychiatric treatment), this movement largely opposes drug treatment, psychiatric care, civil-commitment laws or even the reality of mental illness. Samhsa pushes the "recovery model," an approach that puts the patient in charge of crafting his own recovery plan and stresses "empowerment" and coping rather than medical intervention.


GM Hires 9/11 Figure Feinberg as Adviser
General Motors Co. has hired Ken Feinberg, the attorney known for administering a compensation fund for 9-11 victims, to advise it on how to handle the ignition-switch defect that has been linked to at least 13 deaths.
The move was disclosed by Chief Executive Mary Barra in her testimony Tuesday before Congress and comes amid increasing calls for GM to compensate the families of victims of the defect-related crashes.
Ms. Barra stopped short of saying GM intends to create a settlement fund but vowed the auto maker would "set a new standard" in its response. GM will have its first meeting with Mr. Feinberg Friday and it would take 30 to 60 days before the company decides on its course of action, she added.
"Ken is an expert in this area and he has tremendous experience," Ms. Barra said. after nearly three hours of questioning before the House committee on energy and commerce."We will look at a wide range of opportunities and trust his expertise."
Mr. Feinberg, 68 years old, was appointed to the federal government to oversee the dispersal of compensation for the families of victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, an assignment that set a course for similar work over the last 13 years.


Bag Madness
You might think that European leaders have bigger problems to address than the humble plastic bag. Think again: Bureaucrats in Brussels are now looking to ban, tax or otherwise restrict plastic bags across the EU's 28 nations.
Europe's Committee of the Regions, a consultative body to the European Commission and Council, has suggested outlawing the free distribution of plastic bags at retail stores by 2020 or—even better—banning them entirely. The committee, comprised of 353 local representatives from across the EU, also wants mandatory targets for reducing per-capita plastic-bag use to 35 per person per year, from an estimated EU average of 198 per person per year currently.
The committee's suggestions are a response to the executive European Commission's proposal late last year, which similarly aims for an 80% reduction in plastic-bag use. The commission's proposal, however, would let national governments lessen their plastic-bag use "in whichever way they see fit," via taxes, country-wide bans and so forth. That's not good enough for the committee, which notes that while some EU nations have already imposed charges or restrictions for plastic-bag use, most have let shoppers carry on carrying.
Both the committee's and the commission's texts refer to the scourge of these "single-use" conveniences. The lawmakers who want to restrict them presumably are less likely than their constituents to hoard plastic grocery bags for later reuse. Some governments, in Italy for instance, have already rectified that by requiring "biodegradable" plastic bags. Shoppers can recognize these green-friendly sacks because they start to disintegrate within days, and are thus useless for recycling as garbage bags or emergency handbags.
The European Parliament and Council must now mull the measures before anything becomes law. They'd be wise to take as light a touch as possible. Virtually all the problems attributed to the ready availability of plastic bags could be addressed by enforcing existing rules against littering. Meanwhile, heavy-handed regulations from Brussels on carrying receptacles are precisely the sort of intrusion that make European citizens suspect they do have an old-bag problem—just not the sort that comes from the grocery.


Group Seeks Ordination for Mormon Women
Several hundred Mormon women seeking more authority within the Mormon Church were turned away over the weekend at Temple Square in Salt Lake City after they attempted to enter a key meeting of the church's general conference.
Joanna Brooks, a Mormon Church member and religion scholar from San Diego who flew to Salt Lake City to take part in the rally, estimated about 350 women were denied entry Saturday to what is known as the priesthood session being held at a church conference center.
"That's uncommon. I've been doing this a long time..We haven't had marches like that," said Salt Lake City Police Lt. Lamar Ewell.
The women are asking for "the ordination of women and their full integration into the governance of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," according to the website of Ordain Women, a group started in 2013 by church member and Washington, D.C.-based attorney Kate Kelly.
"The Mormon Church considers the ordination of women "contrary to the Lord's revealed organization for His Church," a church public-affairs officer wrote the group in March.


Made-Over Sharpton Gets Blast From Past
The re-emergence of details about the Rev. Al Sharpton's former role as an FBI informer threatened to cast a shadow from his complicated and often controversial past just as he prepared to host an event headlined by President Barack Obama.
Mr. Sharpton, a left-leaning activist who has become a Democratic Party player and national television host, on Tuesday defended his cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The website "The Smoking Gun" published documents Monday indicating he spied on members of the Genovese crime family in the late 1980s.
The 59-year-old civil-rights figure said he agreed to work as an informer after he was threatened by the mob for demanding that an allegedly mob-connected music executive award more music contracts to black concert promoters.
"I did what was right," Mr. Sharpton said at a news conference.
The documents' authenticity couldn't be independently confirmed. But reports of the pastor's work as an informer have surfaced over the years. Mr. Sharpton noted he wrote about them in an autobiography.


Connecticut's GOP Disavows a Former Star
Voices in Connecticut's Republican establishment sounded a bit weary on Friday about new legal woes for former Gov. John Rowland, but said they were confident the case wouldn't taint their party's brand in an important election year.
"While there may be great fascination in this story," said Jerry Labriola, chairman of the state GOP, "the fact is, John Rowland has no connection to the Connecticut Republican Party—nor has he for over 10 years."
Mr. Rowland, elected governor three times starting in 1995, resigned in 2004 and served 10 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to a corruption-related charge.
On Friday, he pleaded not guilty to a seven-count federal indictment charging him with crimes stemming from alleged attempts to hide his involvement with two congressional campaigns.
Reid Weingarten, an attorney for Mr. Rowland, said Mr. Rowland agreed to a $250,000 self-surety bond, which amounts to a promise to return to court though it doesn't require payment or collateral. "He is confident that he will be entirely vindicated at trial," Mr. Weingarten said. If convicted on all seven charges, Mr. Rowland would face up to 57 years in prison.


Prosecutors Open Another Scandal Front
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. subpoenaed a broad range of records last month from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a person familiar with the matter said, seeking information on some of the agency's highest-profile projects and correspondence among its top officials.
The subpoena, whose existence hadn't previously been disclosed, seeks correspondence among current and former authority officials and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration on topics including the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, various projects in New Jersey and the PATH transportation hub in lower Manhattan, the person said.
The inquiries by Mr. Vance's office reveal a new front of scrutiny for the Port Authority, which has already been targeted by federal prosecutors and lawmakers in the wake of the George Washington Bridge scandal. The unannounced lane closures in September were orchestrated by Mr. Christie's aides and Port Authority allies, causing a five-day traffic mess in Fort Lee, N.J., allegedly as political retribution against the Democratic mayor of the borough.
Spokesmen for Mr. Vance and the Port Authority declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman of New Jersey, who is leading a criminal probe into the September lane closures.
Mr. Christie, a Republican, has said he wasn't involved in the planning of the lane closures or in any efforts to cover them up after. Attorneys hired by the Christie administration reported last month that they had found no evidence he was involved.


Boston Pauses to Remember, Mourn
BOSTON—A year after two bombs exploded in a crowd of spectators at the Boston Marathon, the city commemorated the event Tuesday with a series of solemn tributes to those killed and injured, their families and first responders.
The bombing at the world-famous marathon's finish line killed three and wounded more than 260, including 16 people who lost legs. The tributes are a prelude to this year's marathon on Monday: As many as a million spectators are expected, hundreds of thousands more than usual, cheering on an also bigger-than-usual field of 36,000 runners amid heavy security.
Tensions remained high around the marathon finish line, where Boston Police said Tuesday evening they took a male suspect into custody related to two unattended backpacks, which were destroyed in controlled detonations "for precautionary reasons." Police asked people to avoid the area. The scare caused Boston's transit agency to shut down a nearby subway stop.
Earlier Tuesday, in the largest of the many memorials throughout the city, survivors, first responders and political leaders, including Vice President Joe Biden, participated in a moving tribute to those affected by the tragedy, which injured more than 260 people and killed three at the world-famous marathon on April 15, 2013.
Mr. Biden repeatedly praised the courage of the survivors, calling them an inspiration to anyone who has ever experienced tragedy and a vivid illustration of America's uncommon determination and resilience.


Brooklyn Nets Now the Only Show in Town
Alone at last.
The game, on the penultimate day of the regular season, should have been a battle for playoff position or even for the Atlantic Division title. After all, at this point last season, the Knicks were the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference and the Nets were two spots behind them.
But on Tuesday, with the Knicks already eliminated from postseason contention and the Nets embedded in the No. 5 position in the East, the two teams were playing largely for bragging rights.


Occupy Jury Gets Account From Officer
Defense attorneys Wednesday questioned the key witness in the trial of Cecily McMillan, a 25-year-old student and activist facing up to seven years in prison on the charge of assaulting a police officer, Grantley Bovell, on March 17, 2012, in Zuccotti Park during an Occupy Wall Street event.
Testifying in New York Criminal Court this week, Officer Bovell has said he was escorting Ms. McMillan out of Zuccotti Park that night, after senior officers had announced the park was being closed for cleaning, when suddenly "she crouched down, she elbowed me in the face." Officer Bovell suffered a cut cheek and a swollen eye.
Ms. McMillan's attorneys have said they intend to argue that Officer Bovell grabbed their client from behind, provoking her to throw her elbow in an instinctive reaction. A photograph taken several days later shows a hand-shaped bruise on her right breast.
The videos shown so far are short, grainy and chaotic, and don't appear to conclusively disprove either side's version of events, but both prosecutors and the defense have more videos and video analysis to present.


This Wily Gatecrasher at White House Is a Red Fox
WASHINGTON—There's a new guest at the White House. Unlike most people who pass through the presidential residence, he wasn't invited. But in cutthroat Washington fashion, he saw weakness and took advantage. Now he rests and plays uninhibited at the seat of power.
He also has pointy ears and a bushy tail.
The little red fox, who hasn't been named, turned up on the White House grounds in the weeks before the government shutdown in October. After many White House groundskeepers were furloughed, the fox settled in. Months later, the furry little conundrum has left officials who sort through some of the world's most complex challenges scratching their heads.
The fox lacks the deference typically exhibited by White House guests. He tore through the White House garden when it was left unattended during the shutdown. He graduated to tripping alarms in the middle of the night, napping wherever he pleases and generally living the high life on a campus overseen by dozens of highly trained Secret Service agents.
Even President Barack Obama was stunned, aides say, when he looked outside the Oval Office one morning to see the fox running down the same open-air colonnade along the Rose Garden that has been traversed by American presidents and world dignitaries for the past century.


U.S. Weapons Flow to Syria Rebels
The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have supplied Syrian rebel groups with a small number of advanced American antitank missiles for the first time in a pilot program that could lead to larger flows of sophisticated weaponry, people briefed on the effort said.
The new willingness to arm these rebels comes after the failure of U.S.-backed peace talks in January and recent regime gains on the battlefield. It also follows a reorganization of Western-backed fighters aimed at creating a more effective military force and increasing protection for Christian and other religious minorities—something of particular importance to Washington.
Rebels and their Saudi backers hope the Obama administration will be persuaded to ease its long-standing resistance to supplying advanced weaponry that could tip the balance in the grinding civil war—especially shoulder-fired missiles capable of bringing down planes.


Top Pakistani Talk-Show Host Is Shot
KARACHI, Pakistan—The anchor of Pakistan's top political talk show, Hamid Mir, was shot and injured Saturday in the southern city of Karachi by assailants who ambushed his car on motorcycle, officials and colleagues said.
Pakistani journalists are under regular threat from Islamist militants. However, Mr. Mir's family, colleagues, and some friends immediately blamed the shooting on the country's Inter-Services Intelligence military spy agency, saying he had told them before the attack to hold the organization responsible if anything happened to him.
The military, which oversees ISI, condemned the attack on Mr. Mir.
"An independent inquiry must immediately be carried out to ascertain facts," the military said in a statement. "However raising allegations against ISI or head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading."
ISI has been implicated in violence against journalists in the past, allegations it has denied.


Mediator Moves to Defuse Ukraine Crisis
DONETSK, Ukraine—The international organization tasked with helping defuse Ukraine's crisis intends to bolster its ranks with hundreds more monitors as it tries to convince both pro-Russia and pro-Europe activists who have occupied buildings across Ukraine to stand down.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 57-nation organization including Russia and Ukraine that has long served as a mediator in tense spots, sent the deputy chief of its Ukrainian monitoring mission to Donetsk on Saturday to decide upon steps to reach that goal.
The OSCE now has about 100 monitors across Ukraine but plans to "fast track" its ranks to 300 people and ultimately hopes to have a 500-strong team on the ground, said Michael Borciurkiw, a spokesman for the Ukrainian special monitoring mission.
A joint agreement signed in Geneva on April 17 by the U.S., Russia, the European Union and Ukraine called for activists across Ukraine to surrender their weapons and vacate occupied buildings.
The agreement tasked the OSCE mission with playing "a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation" of such measures.


Pakistan Army Demands Broadcaster's Closure
ISLAMABAD—Pakistan's military demanded that the government close down the country's top-rated TV channel after it aired accusations that the spy agency was behind the shooting of its leading talk-show host.
They blamed the attack on the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, or ISI, and its chief, Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, who they say singled out Mr. Mir for his reports of the spy agency's role in the country's politics.


Judge Voids New York Cap on Super PACs
A federal judge on Thursday overturned New York's cap on contributions to independent political-action committees, saying it violates a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows unlimited spending in elections.
Judge Crotty said he disagreed with the high court's decision, which paved the way for a "never-ending cycle of campaigning and lobbying" that "breeds cynicism and distrust," but had to comply with it.
"Elected officials know where their money is coming from and that it must keep coming if they are to stay in office. Ordinary citizens recognize this; they know what is going on; they know they are not being included," Judge Crotty wrote.


Five U.K. Military Die in Afghan Helicopter Crash
Five British military personnel died when their Lynx helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said.
The crash in Kandahar province marks the third single biggest loss of life of British service personnel since the Afghanistan conflict began in 2001, a ministry spokesman said. It brings the total number of British forces killed in the conflict to 453, he said. British forces are due to conclude their combat mission in Afghanistan later this year.
The crash appears to have been an accident and no enemy action was involved, the spokesman said, adding that an investigation would be carried out. There were no survivors, he said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to release the names or personal details of the personnel who died. The next of kin of all the servicemen have been informed, it said.
Four of the servicemen were based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, southern England, three from the Army Air Corps and one from the Royal Air Force, the ministry said. The fifth was a reservist from 3 Military Intelligence Battalion, based in London, it said.


Democrats See Doomed Minimum- Wage Plan as Election Boost
WASHINGTON—The Senate is expected this week to take up a long-stalled push to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a measure that is likely to be defeated but one that Democrats see as a winner on the campaign trail.
The idea of raising the $7.25-an-hour minimum wage is politically popular, according to polls, but Republicans hope the coming debate will allow them to promote their view that raising the wage will lead to job losses.
Their case was bolstered by a Congressional Budget Office report in February that said a wage increase could cost the economy 500,000 jobs, even while lifting 900,000 people above the poverty line.
For several months, Democratic leaders have wanted to bring the minimum-wage increase to the floor but they have delayed it until this week, moving the debate closer to the period when re-election campaigns heat up.
There also has been talk of a $9-an-hour compromise, but it has faced resistance from both ends of the spectrum, with conservatives wanting no raise and liberals holding firm at $10.10.


FAA Targets Takeoff Hazards Near Runways
Federal regulators are paying more attention to potential hazards posed by new buildings or other obstacles near busy runways, in the event aircraft lose an engine during takeoffs.
A proposed Federal Aviation Administration policy change for the first time explicitly calls for identifying such possible dangers—stemming from a malfunctioning or inoperative engine—when reviewing the height and location of construction projects near hub airports.
The document released Friday also sets procedures for airlines, airport operators and developers to jointly design a single alternate flight path for each runway that would be used by all carriers at large and small airports, in case of an engine-out takeoff.
Historically, FAA's policy has considered potentially hazardous obstacles only under normal aircraft operations. The agency typically requires each airline to determine individual fight paths to skirt or avoid obstacles at the end of runways if an engine should quit. Talk of changes has prompted years of controversy about the extent of proposed development around major hub airports including those serving New York, Miami and Chicago, as well as smaller fields serving Washington, D.C., and other cities.
Some prominent developers and lawmakers oppose the shift as a major reversal of long-standing FAA policy, according to one industry official familiar with the details. Potentially thousands of proposed buildings face tighter height limitations, the official said Sunday, threatening a big financial blow to certain local communities.


Former Montana Teacher to Be Resentenced in Rape Case
Montana's highest court has overturned a contentious one-month prison sentence given to a former high-school teacher who was convicted of raping a student.
The state's Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered Stacey Rambold to be resentenced by a different judge, and criticized the judge who handled the case for his comments that the 14-year-old victim was in "control" of the situation.
Judge G. Todd Baugh. 72 years old, had apologized for the comments and said he would retire at the end of this year.
The court ruled unanimously that Judge Baugh shouldn't have exempted Mr. Rambold from the state's mandatory minimum sentence of four years.
Mr. Rambold was accused of multiple instances of sexual activity with the student in 2007. He reached a deferred prosecution agreement in 2010 after the victim took her own life. Under the deal, he agreed to complete sex-offender treatment or risk prison time.


For City Retirees, It's $300 Million That Never Was
New York City mistakenly paid nearly $300 million from a pension supplement fund to more than 31,000 retired police officers and firefighters on Wednesday.
The city took steps to retrieve the $298,475,644 that was electronically deposited into the former employees' bank accounts and it is expected all of the funds will be retrieved by Friday, according to a statement by city Comptroller Scott Stringer.
Upon learning of the error, union and police officials warned the recipients not to spend the money.
Carolyn Kellerman, president of the independent watchdog agency Citizens Budget Commission, said the financial impact on the city is minimal, perhaps a day's interest on the money, because the mistake was discovered so quickly.
"But the big question is, what's going on there," she said. "What happened? It's stunning. It's really something that demands an explanation."


Amid Controversy, a 'Doable' Job in Newark
Cami Anderson says friends warned her not to take the job of Newark schools superintendent because they thought the troubled district couldn't be fixed.
But she was convinced she could help turn around a state-run system in a poverty-ridden city where 41% of ninth-graders failed to graduate on time.
Three years later, Ms. Anderson, 42 years old, faces mounting criticism from clergy, the city teachers union, mayoral candidates and some parents as she tackles an unprecedented reorganization of schools.
Her goal: boost achievement while grappling with a sharp decline in enrollment, crumbling buildings and the need to close a projected $100 million gap in a $1 billion budget over the next three years.
Amid such obstacles, the state-appointed superintendent says she is determined to create "100 excellent schools" with an eye on fairness.


Fights Loom Over Spending Bills
WASHINGTON—Compared with last fall's ferocious struggle, Congress should face fewer hurdles this year in its annual effort to keep the government funded.
That doesn't mean it will be easy, though.
Few expect to see anything like a repeat of last year's cataclysmic budget battle that ended in a 16-day partial government shutdown. That is in large part because of the two-year bipartisan budget deal that both chambers approved in December, which includes an agreement to cap discretionary spending for fiscal year 2015 at $1.014 trillion. Moreover, party leaders have made clear they want to minimize fiscal feuding during an election year.
Lawmakers are wasting no time getting started on the appropriations process, the 12 spending bills that Congress tries to pass each year covering the roughly one-third of the government's total budget it must approve annually. The rest, known as mandatory spending, includes the major federal safety-net programs such as Social Security, the funding for which is continued on autopilot.
This past week, the House easily passed the first two spending bills with bipartisan votes, having started the appropriations process in committee at the earliest point in the year since at least 1974. The Senate is expected to begin debating its first two spending bills in committee later this month.


A Volunteer Legacy at Boys & Girls Club
Her father found his passion for supporting young children through a pro-bono volunteer commitment. Now, Cynthia Coudert, daughter of the late Frederic 'Fritz' R. Coudert, is helping carry forward her family's tie to the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club.
Ms. Coudert, 48 years old, is a teacher at New York's Nightingale-Bamford School and currently serves as a vice president for the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club, one of the country's oldest and best-known Boys & Girls Clubs. The organization provides educational and recreational activities for roughly 12,000 needy children and teens living in the Bronx. She donates around $200,000 to the organization annually through a family foundation shared with her stepmother, Margaret Coudert, and sister, Sandra Coudert Graham.
Ms. Coudert doesn't quite recall when her father, who died in 2008, got involved with the organization, but she remembers that the tie to the charity was already firmly set when she began her own volunteer commitment there nearly three decades ago. Family legend has it that her father became involved by happenstance through some pro-bono work, she said. Mr. Coudert, an attorney, was a partner of Coudert Brothers, the New York law firm that dissolved in 2006.
Over time, Mr. Coudert went on to take an outsize role in the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club, said his daughter. "He married my mom and he started to have kids and I think the organization just really grew on him. I don't think he ever knew how much it would become a part of his life," said Ms. Coudert.
Mr. Coudert served on the organization's board for many years, instituted a program for teens and funded the construction of a sports complex. In 2010, the Frederic R. & Margaret Coudert Clubhouse opened in the West Bronx. Up until his death, Mr. Coudert and his family hosted hundreds of children for a day of summer fun at the family house in Oyster Bay, N.Y.


Providing a Road Map for Day Camps
What happens when a community-based project outgrows its locality?
You go big, said George Ross, the executive vice president and senior counsel of the Trump Organization, based in New York.
Sunrise Day Camp, a Long Island-based group that provides day camp to children with cancer and their siblings, began in 2006 as a project of the Barry and Florence Friedberg Jewish Community Center in Oceanside, N.Y.
That first year, the camp had 96 children. Last year, Sunrise served nearly 3,000 children, from 31⁄2 to 16 years old, in the Long Island and New York City areas. There is a satellite operation in Even Yehuda, Israel, too.
In recent years, it became clear that Sunrise could grow—and needed to grow—beyond the region, said Mr. Ross, 86 years old.


Bridge Queries Join Christie on the Road
PORTLAND, Maine—New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has played a behind-the-scenes role in the six months since he was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, raising record amounts of money for GOP candidates across the country.
But Wednesday, the New Jersey Republican stood squarely in front of the cameras here and took a rare turn answering questions as RGA chairman—something he once relished as governor but has done less since the George Washington Bridge scandal broke.
Mr. Christie said Wednesday that voters would be hearing more from him but that his previous reticence had nothing to do with the scandal. "This is the plan we've had all along," Mr. Christie said, as he stood next to Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican facing a tough re-election fight.
Mr. Christie said he would soon be doing more on-the-ground stumping in New Mexico and Tennessee.


Fannie-Freddie Overhaul Talks Break Down
Talks between top lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee and a group of Democrats seen as key swing votes to advance a bipartisan overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broke down Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, raising the prospect that the bill won't advance beyond the committee this year.
Lawmakers last week postponed a committee vote on the overhaul bill, unveiled in March by Sens. Tim Johnson (D., S.D.) and Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), the heads of the committee, to wrest more support from the 22-member panel.
Lawmakers said last week they could have passed the bill with a narrow majority, but many analysts believe a larger "supermajority" would be needed to compel Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) to bring the bill up for a floor vote ahead of the November midterm elections.
Efforts over the past week had focused on winning three of six uncommitted Democrats on the panel: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Consumer and civil-rights groups had raised a series of objections to the proposed bill.
The Obama administration has worked behind the scenes to forge compromises on a series of technical issues designed to ensure broad mortgage-credit access and to curb the ability of big banks to grow even bigger under any privatized market.


Yemeni Witnesses Describe Shooting by U.S. Officials
SAN'A, Yemen—Witnesses to the fatal shootings last month of two Yemenis by American government officials said they saw a Western-looking man pull a gun from his belt and shoot both Yemenis dead during what appeared to be a kidnapping attempt at a barber shop.
The firsthand accounts bear similarities but also what appear to be slight differences with an incident the U.S. State Department revealed Saturday in which it said two U.S. embassy officers killed a pair of armed men who were attempting to kidnap them last month. The U.S. officials have left the country, according to the State Department.
Three Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said Saturday that the incident the U.S. State Department officials are describing is the same as the April 24 killings of the two Yemeni men.
Yemen has seen increasing numbers of attacks and kidnapping attempts on Westerners in the country, which is battling a strengthening, Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda.
Despite frequent kidnappings of Westerners in the capital, what appears to have been an attempted abduction on April 24 outside the Taj barbershop on San'a's grimy Hadda street stood out for how the intended target reacted, witnesses said.


Back-to-Back Parties for the Whitney
For an organization to have one fundraiser in a week is a lot. To have two? You've got to be kidding!
But the Whitney Museum of American Art was actually not joking last week. With the help of the fashion line Max Mara and the Maramotti family, the institution threw back-to-back parties at Highline Stages.
The first, a seated dinner for the American Art Award Gala, honored Dorothy Lichtenstein and the Warhol Foundation and brought out the heavy hitters, like Brooke Garber Neidich, Lise and Michael Evans, John McEnroe and Patty Smyth, Nancy and Howard Marks, Larry Gagosian, Justine and Jeff Koons and John and Amy Phelan.
The following night, a much younger crowd—including actresses Emmy Rossum and Zoe Saldana as well as fashion consultant Roopal Patel, jewelry designer Zani Gugelmann, fashion blogger Leandra Medine and Nan Kempner's granddaughter Meggie Kempner—joined to celebrate the Whitney's annual Art Party, which is hosted by the Whitney Contemporaries and featured a silent art auction powered by Artsy.
The events used to fall a month or so away from each other, said Gina Rogak, the Whitney's director of special events. This year, Ms. Rogak said the goal was to experiment and have the two parties on the same night. But it was hard to find a venue that could house 325 people for the awards dinner and another several hundred or so for the Art Party.


Police: Officer Shoots Man Who Threatened With Gun
A New York Police Department officer shot and wounded a man in the Fordham section of the Bronx early Sunday morning, officials said.
Police said 23-year-old Jarius Copper pointed a handgun at plainclothes police after being confronted on Marion Avenue near East 188th Street, and a lieutenant responded by firing five times, striking the suspect once in the left ankle.
Police were responding to gunfire at about 2:48 a.m. when they spotted Mr. Copper allegedly holding a handgun, and heard additional shots before ordering him to drop the weapon, they said.
Police said Mr. Copper, of Brooklyn, faces charges of attempted murder, attempted felony assault and firearms offenses. A .22-caliber revolver was recovered at the scene, police said. He was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital.


A New Face of Terror Emerges in Africa
ABUJA, Nigeria—When he appeared in a video on Monday boasting of having abducted more than 200 schoolgirls, the leader of terror group Boko Haram took the occasion to egg on the U.S. Army and get in a dig at ancient Egypt.
"We don't fear any American troops," shouted Abubakar Shekau, whose Islamist insurgency has terrorized northern Nigeria and recently drawn search-and-rescue advisers from the U.S. and other countries. "Let even the Pharaoh himself be sent down here! We will deal with him squarely!"
Bombastic and bellicose, Mr. Shekau has shown a boundless appetite for celebrity. He has sought to achieve it through mass murder and most notably through the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in April from a boarding school in the country's north.
By boasting—and laughing—about these deeds on YouTube, often with an AK-47 slung over his shoulder, Mr. Shekau has attained the distinction that has long eluded him: Africa's most notorious terrorist.
"He seems to want to distinguish himself by the depth of his brutality," said Daniel Benjamin, a former counterterrorism chief at the State Department who is currently director of Dartmouth College's Dickey Center for International Understanding. "It is a big part of his calling card."


Connecticut GOP Endorses Foley for Governor
Uncasville, Conn.—Connecticut's Republican party endorsed Greenwich businessman Tom Foley as its candidate for governor Saturday, but two others also qualified for spots on the primary ballot, setting up a possible showdown this August.
State Senate Minority Leader John McKinney and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton both earned enough delegate votes here at the Republican state convention at the Mohegan Sun to force a primary.
Each Republican candidate is seeking the chance to unseat Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy, who was endorsed by his party Friday. Republicans say they like their chances taking on Mr. Malloy no matter which candidate wins the primary.
"Voters know that Gov. Malloy's progressive agenda has not worked and Connecticut is heading down the wrong track," Mr. Foley said. "We must break the status quo agenda of ever higher taxes and growing wasteful spending."
Mr. Foley had a strong win among Republican delegates Saturday, earning 57% of the votes cast. Mr. Boughton came in second with 22%, and Mr. McKinney came in third with 21%.


Bombings Kill Scores in Nigerian City
ABUJA, Nigeria—Three bombs struck the crowded city of Jos in quick succession on Tuesday, aid workers said, killing at least 118 people and putting one of Africa's most religiously divided cities back on edge.
Two bombs struck a teeming downtown marketplace minutes apart in the afternoon before a third blast occurred near a military outpost, said a Nigerian Red Cross aid worker who estimated that 40 people had been killed.
Other aid workers, meanwhile, hung back—afraid of the possibility of a fourth bomb, he said. Witnesses told the British Broadcasting Corp. that they had seen more than 40 bodies carried into a nearby hospital.
"It's serious," said the Red Cross responder. "It was located at the heart of the city. The heart of the city."
No group took immediate responsibility for the attacks. Still, the apparently indiscriminate bombings bore all of the gruesome hallmarks of Islamist insurgency Boko Haram, the same group that kidnapped 276 teenage girls from a high school in April.


Stubb Leads Finland's European Parliament Vote
HELSINKI—Finland's high-profile Minister for European Affairs Alexander Stubb, who is also running to become Finland's next prime minister, was on track to clinch a seat in the European Parliament after 45% of ballots had been counted in his home country on Sunday night.
According to an official vote count updated at 8.55 p.m. local time (1755 GMT), Mr. Stubb had received 61,513 direct votes, or the most among the 251 Finnish candidates competing for the 13 Finnish seats in the European parliament.
Mr. Stubb is also running in a three-candidate race to become the next leader of his political party, the National Coalition Party in Finland.
The race began after the NCP's current leader and Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen announced in April that he will step down from his party and government positions to seek a top European Union post this summer.
The winner of NCP's leadership contest is likely to succeed Mr. Katainen as the head of Finland's five-party coalition government until the next parliamentary elections in Finland in April 2015.


Industry Worries About Carbon-Cuts Proposal
WASHINGTON—The coal and utility industries are increasingly worried about the Obama administration's coming climate-change rule, especially the baseline period from which reduction targets will be calculated.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday will propose regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants—a major component of the administration's climate-change initiative. The proposal, which is in the final stages of development, is expected to set differing state-by-state percentage reduction targets, rather than a single percentage figure, calculated from a baseline year or average set of years, according to people familiar with EPA deliberations on the rule.
The year the standard is based on is critical because U.S. carbon emissions have fluctuated significantly in the past decade. Emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This is due to several factors, including sluggish economic growth, stagnant electricity usage and natural gas displacing some of coal's share of the electricity mix.
The utility industry would like to work from a baseline set between 2005 and 2007 because those years were the highest ever for U.S. carbon emissions. Emissions started falling in 2008, so using a more recent time frame would set more aggressive carbon-reduction targets.
"The most important detail in the rule isn't the percentage reduction number that will be the lead line in almost every news story," said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research organization founded by two former Senate leaders from each party. "Most important is going to be the baseline year."


EPA Plan Stokes Posturing in Midterm Elections
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama's plan to reduce carbon emissions is escalating environmental policy fights in energy-rich states, home to many of the marquee races that could determine which party controls the Senate after November's elections.
Democrats running in conservative-leaning states in Appalachia and other energy-producing areas quickly distanced themselves from the draft rule released Monday by the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposal aims to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants by an average of 30% from 2005 levels by 2030.
"When I'm in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the president's attack on Kentucky's coal industry, because protecting our jobs will be my No. 1 priority," said Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in one of the year's most expensive races.
Even in areas less dominated by coal, vulnerable Democrats criticized Mr. Obama for acting without congressional approval to advance his agenda. They sought to do so carefully to avoid alienating the party's base, which generally supports efforts to combat climate change.
Republicans, who face little political risk from criticizing the president, labeled the proposed rule a job-killing reward to his environmental donors and a new "energy tax" that would drive up electricity prices.


Brazil Needs Sign U.S. Spying Has Ended, President Rousseff Says
BRASÍLIA—Brazil is eager to rebuild relations with the U.S. but needs a strong sign that there will be no more spying on Brazilian citizens, President Dilma Rousseff told reporters Tuesday.
Ms. Rousseff canceled a state visit to Washington last year following press reports that the National Security Agency had spied on Brazilian citizens, including the president, and Brazilian companies. The articles were based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The spying claims led to considerable tension between the two regional allies, and Brazilian officials have asked the U.S. to provide assurances that it wouldn't spy on allies.
Ms. Rousseff said conditions aren't in place for a state visit. Brazil needs a "strong sign" that there will be no new accusations of espionage, the president said during a dinner with foreign correspondents at the official residence, the Palácio Alvorada, or Palace of the Dawn. In a buoyant mood, she spoke at length about the World Cup, which kicks off next week, the economy, and her bid for re-election later this year.
Ms. Rousseff reiterated her belief that the World Cup will be a success, and said that the country is ready to host the tournament. Some of the 32 participating teams have already started arriving in Brazil, and the nation of 200 million is turning its attention to the opening match on June 12, between Brazil and Croatia.


Mayor Criticizes Housing Authority on Cameras
Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the "unacceptable bureaucracy" of his public housing authority Tuesday, saying it has taken too long to install security cameras despite the availability of millions of dollars.
The long-running issue took on greater urgency this week when a suspect fatally stabbed 6-year-old Prince Joshua Avitto and critically injured 7-year-old Mikayla Capers in the Boulevard Houses in Brooklyn on Sunday. Police believe the attacks are related to another fatal stabbing on Friday.
The suspect remains on the loose, and police have said their investigation has been hindered because there were no cameras in the New York City Housing Authority building where the stabbing occurred.
"I have not been satisfied in the past, especially in the previous administration," Mr. de Blasio said at an unrelated news conference. "I'm not satisfied, in fact, in my administration either that the urgency has been sufficient."
A $500,000 contract for 15 cameras at the Boulevard Houses—including one camera for the building where the stabbing occurred—was approved Monday by the city's Office of Management and Budget.


Ex-Guantanamo Detainees Return to Violence
CASABLANCA—A decade ago, the U.S. released three hardened Moroccan militants from Guantanamo and turned them over to the Moroccan government on the assumption they wouldn't return to the battlefield.
They wound up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups fighting in Syria's civil war.
Their story serves as a cautionary tale days after President Barack Obama released five high-level Taliban figures from the same detention center in a swap for an American soldier held in Afghanistan for nearly five years.
By January 2014, about 29% of 614 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba had returned to violence, according to the Director of National Intelligence.
Like the three Moroccans, the five Afghans went free with a friendly government's consent to monitor them. As part of the deal that released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the Qatari government agreed to keep the five ex-detainees in the Gulf emirate for at least a year to prevent them from returning to violence.


Immigration's Primary Effect Muted
Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared to put himself in political jeopardy when he wrote and championed an overhaul of immigration laws, but he is poised to lap the field in Tuesday's Republican primary in South Carolina. GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also backed the bill, is in a strong position ahead of his primary this August.
Rep. Renee Ellmers (R., N.C.) easily survived a primary challenge after backing liberalized laws. And Tim Donnelly, a leader in the movement to stop illegal immigration, lost to another Republican this month in California's open primary for governor.
Opposition to an immigration-law overhaul remains high within the Republican Party, but primary season is showing that support isn't necessarily a career-ending move, nor is opposition a clear path to the nomination. That could factor into the decision by House GOP leaders on whether to move broad immigration legislation this year.
"So far, being against immigration reform is not the ticket to victory that a lot of the proponents of that point of view seemed to think that it was," said GOP pollster Whit Ayres, who advises Mr. Graham's campaign and supports an immigration overhaul. He described opponents of the Senate legislation as "an intense" minority.
Standing against liberalized laws is still a powerful stance in some races. Many Republicans have avoided taking a clear stand, partly because of the perceived political consequences. That complicates the question of which side in the immigration debate may be drawing momentum from the primaries.


Putin Retakes Normandy
Western leaders supposedly rebuked Vladimir Putin for his Crimea conquest by moving this year's G-8 meeting from Sochi and disinviting the Russian President. But you wouldn't know it by taking a look at Mr. Putin's calendar this week as the G-7 convened without him in Brussels.
French President Francois Hollande broke ranks first by inviting Mr. Putin to the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings on Friday. We don't recall the Red Army took part in D-Day, but Mr. Hollande has Mistral cruisers to sell to Moscow. He followed up with a Thursday dinner invitation for the Russian, the same night that he had a previously scheduled meal with President Obama. A man of legendary appetites, the Frenchman kept both dates.
Perhaps feeling left out of this social swirl, British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel scheduled their own meetings with the Russian leader. So much for Mr. Obama's argument that the West is uniting to isolate the man in the Kremlin.
Russia's government-controlled media will portray these meetings as evidence that their country has suffered very little diplomatic punishment since Crimea. And Mr. Putin might even figure he's better off because he no longer has to attend the G-7 gabfests but still gets to go to dinner.


Driver in Crash that Hurt Tracy Morgan Pleads Not Guilty
A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. truck driver charged in a New Jersey Turnpike crash that critically injured actor Tracy Morgan and killed another comedian entered pleas of not guilty during his arraignment in court Wednesday.
Kevin J. Roper of Jonesboro, Ga., out on $50,000 bail since the Saturday crash, arrived at Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick at about 2:30 p.m. with his lawyer. He is charged with vehicular homicide by operating a vehicle recklessly and one count of recklessly causing serious bodily injury, and faces up to 10 years in prison on the most serious count.
The Middlesex County Prosecutor's office alleges Mr. Roper, 35 years old, was driving a Wal-Mart tractor trailer north on the turnpike when it struck the back of Mr. Morgan's Mercedes limousine bus at about 1 a.m. on Saturday in Cranbury Township, north of Exit 8. The crash killed Mr. Morgan's writing partner, James McNair, and injured two others in that vehicle.
A criminal complaint said Mr. Roper hadn't slept for a "period in excess of 24 hours" before the crash.
Neither Mr. Roper nor his attorney, David J. Glassman, addressed the sleep allegation on Wednesday. Wal-Mart has said Mr. Roper was operating the truck within federal rules that require rest between work shifts.


In Dan Halloran's New York, Republicans Rule
Former City Councilman Daniel Halloran told an undercover federal agent secretly recording him that he had helped secure approvals for Democratic state Sen. Malcolm Smith to run for mayor as a Republican.
But he said it would come at a cost.
On a tape played Wednesday during their bribery trial, Mr. Halloran, a Republican, said he wanted Mr. Smith to name him as the first deputy mayor so the GOP "would have control over half of the appointments."
In addition, Mr. Smith would have to agree that at least half of the more than 100 city agency executives and judicial appointments had to be Republicans.
Mr. Halloran, 43 years old, also heard on tapes played in White Plains federal court discussing providing what prosecutors charge was bribe money to the city's five county Republican committees. Mr. Smith needed the approval of three to run on the GOP line.


U.S. Resumes Drone Attacks in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan—At least two U.S. drone strikes hit Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal region, a stronghold for militants, Pakistani officials said, marking a resumption of the drone program Washington had effectively suspended late last year.
Local security officials said at least three suspected militants were killed in the first drone strike at around 8:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, the initial attack this year. The target was a vehicle and house near Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, they said. Some local officials suggested the vehicle was being prepared for a suicide attack. The identity of those killed wasn't immediately clear.
The second strike hit at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Thursday. Local officials said several missiles were fired and multiple targets appeared to have been hit, again near Miranshah.
Although the U.S. hadn't abandoned the drone program, strikes hadn't taken place after Dec. 25, as Islamabad had pursued peace talks with Pakistani Taliban militants. Pakistan had asked Washington to halt the strikes to enable negotiations.
There is widespread opposition in Pakistan to U.S. drones, including from the current government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Washington considers drones to have been highly effective against militants in Pakistan's tribal areas, though the program was much reduced before the suspension, with a total of 27 hits in 2013—compared with 122 drone strikes in 2010, according to a tally kept by New America Foundation, an independent research organization in Washington.


Indonesia's Candidates
At first glance, Indonesia's July 9 presidential election offers voters a clear choice. The two candidates, Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto, promise very different governing styles—populist humility from one, military-style efficiency from the other.
Yet when it comes to economic affairs, they both emphasize protectionism and central planning. That means this election could be a lost opportunity for Southeast Asia's largest economy to turn away from economic nationalism.
Mr. Widodo—known by his nickname Jokowi—became Jakarta governor just two years ago, but he has earned acclaim for improving government services and accountability. Mr. Subianto is a military man who rose to prominence in the 1990s as then-President Suharto's son-in-law and special-forces commander. Since Suharto's 1998 fall, Mr. Subianto has been a businessman and vice-presidential candidate.
Mr. Subianto promises to "face off" against foreign investors and chose as his running mate Hatta Rajasa. As economics minister from 2010 until this year, Mr. Rajasa engineered Jakarta's turn away from economic reform in the second term of outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. He supported limits on foreign ownership of mines and banks, bans on rattan exports and quotas on imports of beef, fruit and vegetables.
Mr. Rajasa also cancelled privatizations, helped slam apparel and textile firms with Asia's steepest minimum-wage hikes, and pushed a "master plan" for infrastructure that failed to tackle corruption. All in the name of economic justice for the common man, of course.


Brazil's Neves Wins Party Nomination, Will Challenge President Rousseff
SÃO PAULO—Brazilian Senator Aécio Neves won the Brazilian Social Democratic Party's nomination for October's presidential election on Saturday, the same day a new poll showed the candidate gaining ground on President Dilma Rousseff.
Ms. Rousseff would get 32.2% of votes in the election, according to the survey by Instituto Sensus and Isto É magazine, compared with 34% at the end of April. Mr. Neves would gain 21.5% of the votes, up from 19.9% previously, while Brazilian Socialist Party hopeful Eduardo Campos would get 7.5%, from 8.3% in April.
"This will be the most competitive presidential race in Brazil in many years," said João Augusto de Castro Neves, Latin America director at political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group in Washington. "But we still see the president as favorite, with a 70% chance of being re-elected."
The 54-year-old former governor of the state of Minas Gerais is taking on the president amid criticism of rising prices, sluggish economic growth and out-of-control spending on the soccer World Cup championship taking place in Brazil.
"Problems we thought had been overcome, such as inflation, are now back," Mr. Neves said in an emotional speech to thousands of supporters in São Paulo. "It's a consequence of a government which thinks only about itself and has lost the ability to listen."


Russia Urged to Broker Cease Fire
DNIPROPETROVSK, Ukraine—European leaders pressed Moscow to help implement a cease-fire between pro-Russia militants and Ukrainian forces after the downing of a military plane this weekend raised pressure to stop the growing bloodshed in Ukraine's east.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius urged his Russian counterpart in a phone call Sunday to help broker a cease-fire a day after French President François Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to do the same.
The round of diplomatic discussions followed news that Russian-backed militants shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane on Saturday, killing all 40 service members and nine crew on board—the deadliest episode in months of unrest in eastern Ukraine.
The incident, which happened amid fresh evidence that Russia is arming fighters in Ukraine with tanks and heavy weapons, spurred Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko to urge the quick implementation of broad sanctions against Moscow in a telephone call with Mr. Hollande over the weekend.
Meanwhile, Russia looked set to cut off natural-gas supplies to Ukraine as early as Monday, after a final round of talks ended without a deal.


The Pace of Obama's Disasters
Was it only 10 months ago that President Obama capitulated on Syria? And eight months ago that we learned he had no idea the U.S. eavesdropped on Angela Merkel? And seven months ago that his administration struck its disastrous interim nuclear deal with Tehran? And four months ago that Chuck Hagel announced that the United States Army would be cut to numbers not seen since the 1930s? And three months ago that Russia seized Crimea? And two months ago that John Kerry's Israeli-Palestinian peace effort sputtered into the void? And last month that Mr. Obama announced a timetable for total withdrawal from Afghanistan—a strategy whose predictable effects can now be seen in Iraq?
Even the Bergdahl deal of yesterweek is starting to feel like ancient history. Like geese, Americans are being forced to swallow foreign-policy fiascoes at a rate faster than we can possibly chew, much less digest.
Consider the liver.
On Thursday, Russian tanks rolled across the border into eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Russian separatists downed a Ukrainian transport jet, murdering 49 people. On Monday, Moscow stopped delivering gas to Kiev. All this is part of the Kremlin's ongoing stealth invasion and subjugation of its neighbor. And all of this barely made the news. John Kerry phoned Moscow to express his "strong concern." Concern, mind you, not condemnation.
If the president of the United States had any thoughts on the subject, he kept them to himself. His weekly radio address was devoted to wishing America's dads a happy Father's Day.


Ex-Official at Met Council Gets Jail Time for Fraud
The former chief financial officer of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty was sentenced Tuesday to pay $775,000 and serve four months in jail for his role in a decadeslong kickback scheme that defrauded the social-services agency of some $9 million.
Herbert Friedman, 80 years old, admitted in May that he received $250,000 from the grand larceny and kickback scheme, which centered on submitting inflated invoices for the nonprofit's insurance premiums.
A call to Mr. Friedman's attorney wasn't immediately returned. Until his departure from the organization in 2009, Mr. Friedman was responsible for payments to outside vendors, including payments to Century Coverage Corp., a Valley Stream, N.Y.-based insurance company involved in the scheme, according to the investigation by Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. Joseph Ross, the owner of Century, previously pleaded guilty. Three co-conspirators, including Met Council's former chief executive William Rapfogel, have also pleaded guilty in the case. Write to Melanie Grayce West at 


U.S., EU Agree Russia Must Ease Ukraine Crisis
U.S. and European leaders spoke Friday and agreed that Russia must take significant steps to ease tensions in Ukraine or face new costs, the White House said.
President Barack Obama spoke separately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, according to a White House statement.
"They agreed that should Russia fail to take immediate, concrete steps to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, the United States and the European Union would coordinate additional steps to impose costs on Russia," the White House said.
The statement didn't specify those costs, though earlier Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters "sectoral sanctions remain on the table."
"The more that Russia plays a destabilizing role in Ukraine, the more isolated from the international community they will become," Mr. Earnest said.


Insurgents Give Boost To Region's Sunni Sect
The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham's recent battlefield gains in Iraq are providing a morale boost to many of the region's Sunnis, who believe the extremist group is checking Shiite power.
Many Sunnis, even those who disagree with the views of ISIS, as the group is known, see a certain justice in its fight in Iraq against Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki, a Shiite who they say discriminates against their sect.
They view the recent ISIS gains as a vindication after a decade in which Shiites have seized new powers in Lebanon and Iraq and the political fortunes of the region's Sunni elites waned.
"People here cheer ISIS in Iraq thinking it is different from the Syrian ISIS because in Iraq, they are fighting Maliki," said Abdul Salam el-Hussein, a 20-year-old supporter of the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army.
Speaking from the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor, Mr. Hussein added: "The people of Deir Ezzor do not like Maliki for two reasons: first because of sectarian divisions, and second because he closed the door to Syrian refugees entering Iraq and aid coming from Iraq."


Afghan Election Official Draws Ire
KABUL—Presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah's campaign stepped up pressure on Afghanistan's chief election officer on Sunday, releasing phone recordings that allegedly show the officer orchestrated the rigging of the nation's election.
Mr. Amarkhil, shown a transcript of the recordings before the Abdullah campaign released them, said he doesn't recall having had such a conversation. "I would never talk like that," he said in an interview.
Hamidullah Farooqi, a spokesman for the Ghani campaign, said that he can't confirm the tapes' veracity, adding that his campaign condemns fraud by any camp. "Our team is not in a position to defend Mr. Amarkhil or his activity on election day. If he did wrong, he is responsible for it," Mr. Farooqi said.


New York State Senate Coalition Ends
A breakaway faction of Democrats that shares leadership with Republicans in the New York state Senate said Wednesday that it would reunite with the mainline Democrats, potentially shifting the power dynamic in Albany.
The new alliance wouldn't come until after the elections in November and likely wouldn't affect any legislation this year because lawmakers are on recess until January.
The deal was negotiated in large part by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his top aides and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and would set the stage for Democratic control of both chambers of the legislature in 2015.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat facing re-election this year, praised the decision, saying that there is "no doubt there are progressive goals that we have yet to achieve and that we must accomplish next January."
The arrangement is contingent on the result of the legislative elections, though it is unlikely that Senate Republicans, with 29 members in the 63-member chamber, could pick up enough seats to ensure a majority in January.


Showdown Over N.J. Taxes
New Jersey lawmakers on Thursday sent Gov. Chris Christie a $34.1 billion budget that would increase taxes on the state's wealthiest residents and corporations to pay for a record $2.25 billion payment into the public-worker pension fund.
Mr. Christie, a Republican, has pledged to veto any tax increases delivered to his desk by the Democrat-led Legislature. His office declined to comment on Thursday. He and the Legislature have until Monday to pass a balanced budget.
Democrats said the budget was responsible and honored a 2011 law to phase in growing pension payments for public workers. The Senate passed it 24 to 16, and the Assembly, 48 to 31, largely along party lines.
"This is a responsible plan that meets our legally mandated fiscal obligations and provides much-needed relief for those struggling the most by asking just a little more from the most fortunate among us," said Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, after the tax package passed.
Republicans said the tax increases would hurt businesses and drive away residents.


High Court Curbs Presidential Power
But they split over the extent to which they should limit the president's recess-appointment power. The court's four liberals, joined by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, declined to nearly eliminate the capability, as a lower court had done. The majority cited two centuries of historical practice in holding that the president may make temporary appointments when the Senate ceases conducting business for at least 10 days.
The court's four most conservative members, in a separate opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, called the recess-appointment power an "anachronism" that should vanish, given that the Senate in modern times can quickly convene to do business, such as sign off on presidential appointments.
The decision was a win for employers who contested the validity of labor-board rulings made by the recess appointees over an 18-month period in 2012 and 2013. It puts in question hundreds of decisions the board issued during the time, covering a variety of disputes over union organizing, collective-bargaining agreements and employee-discipline cases.
The board issued a total of 436 decisions in contested cases between Jan. 31, 2012, and July 16, 2013, an NLRB spokesman said. Two of the recess appointees—Democrats Richard Griffin and Sharon Block—were on the board during that 18-month period, while the other—Republican Terence Flynn—stepped down in the summer of 2012.


In South Africa, Upstart Party Stands Out in Red
CAPE TOWN, South Africa—In Parliament here, where fashion accessories such as fur loincloths and bright wool blankets have been cheered as hallmarks of diversity, red hard hats and overalls have some people up in arms.
The fiery red get-ups are the attire of choice for 25 lawmakers from the upstart Economic Freedom Fighters, a radical left-wing party that won 6.4% of the vote in its debut election in May.
"We are representing our workers and the poor masses," said EFF leader Julius Malema.
Dressed in his red uniform and black gumboots, Mr. Malema took to the podium on June 18 to criticize President Jacob Zuma's state of the nation address the night before. "You are a man of tradition, Mr. President," Mr. Malema said of the business-suit-clad Mr. Zuma. "A tradition of empty promises."
The party is shaking up South Africa's sleepy Parliament. Mr. Malema and his cohorts have signaled they plan to clash with Mr. Zuma's ruling African National Congress—whose youth wing Mr. Malema once headed—not only on policy, but also on wardrobe choices.


Hong Kong Rallies for Democracy
About half a million people marched through downtown Hong Kong Tuesday with a message for Beijing: We won't accept sham democracy. The high turnout reflects anger that China's central government is backtracking on its promise to hold a free and fair election for the city's chief executive in 2017.
Tuesday's rally followed a 10-day unofficial referendum organized by the pro-democracy coalition Occupy Central with Love and Peace. Hong Kong residents were invited to support several different nomination systems other than those put forward by pro-Beijing parties. Nearly 800,000 people, or 22% of the electorate, participated. Hong Kongers oppose the central government's plans to use a small nominating committee dominated by its local loyalists, a system that would exclude pro-democracy politicians from running for chief executive.
The referendum also affirmed that most Hong Kongers want to see a compromise with Beijing rather than confrontation. The most resolute democrats initially succeeded in skewing the ballot choices in favor of open-nomination systems that the Chinese government had already ruled out. Moderates then managed to insert a choice that simply called for a system that meets international democratic standards. That choice won support from 88% of voters.

Driving turnout for the referendum and the march was a white paper issued last month by China's State Council condemning Hong Kongers' "wrong views." It underscored Beijing's "comprehensive jurisdiction" over the city's 7.2 million residents, and demanded patriotism—that is, subordination to the Communist Party—from local officials and judges.
The backlash to Beijing's move included an unusual rally Friday in which 1,800 lawyers in black suits marched to the Court of Final Appeal. "Lawyers are marching because we see the white paper as an attempt to rewrite the Basic Law by giving our judges political missions, which are not acceptable at all," said one. Said another: "We want to send a very clear message to the Central People's Government: Don't interfere, don't damage the rule of law."
If in the coming months Beijing refuses to compromise in the face of peaceful demands to keep its promises, civil disobedience may be justified. In that event, Hong Kong's civic leaders will deserve the world's support.


Britain Frets Over Cost of Expanding Navy
ROSYTH, Scotland—Queen Elizabeth II is scheduled on Friday to christen the first of two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy, despite lingering questions over whether Britain can afford both vessels.
HMS Queen Elizabeth is due to start sailing with combat jets in 2020—a decade after Britain suspended its membership in the elite club of militaries with that capacity, one that already includes India and China.
For the Royal Navy's top brass, the carrier represents another milestone in the country's storied history as a naval power.
But amid severe budget constraints following Europe's deepest recession since World War II, the U.K. government has yet to buy jets for the Queen Elizabeth, and will mothball the planned sister ship to save money.
That squeeze means Britain's ability to use its carrier to project military power will be significantly limited.


Will EU Persist With Almunia's Legacy?
The European Union's antitrust chief has a powerful weapon at his disposal, and he has been increasingly willing to use it.
Since he took over the competition portfolio at the European Commission in 2010, Joaquín Almunia has ventured ever further beyond his core remit of breaking up cartels and reviewing mergers, pushing into areas such as tax planning by multinationals and global patent wars.
As he nears the end of his term, many people are asking whether the activist trend will continue after Mr. Almunia leaves.
Some experts worry that the trend harbors risks—particularly as the commission comes under unprecedented political pressure to use its antitrust arsenal in pursuit of goals that aren't directly related to competition.
"Competition policy isn't the solution for all the world's ills," said Pat Treacy, an antitrust lawyer with Bristows LLP in London. "The commission has pushed the boundary pretty far."


NYPD's Facebook Page Shares Its Triumphs
The New York Police Department's Facebook page has taken on a role that was once largely limited to the city's press corps: publishing news articles.
It is part of a push to both bolster the department's social media presence and to find ways to get its message directly to its nearly 250,000 followers on the social media site. The department also has more than 106,000 Twitter followers.
Over the past month, police officers who were once journalists pen articles about all types of police work, such as graffiti busts, fireworks confiscations and officers aiding a colleague suffering from a heart attack.
"A rookie Bronx cop on a footpost this morning chased down and arrested a gun-toting 17-year-old who, moments earlier, fired four shots into another man and left him for dead on a Mount Eden street," read one June 18 Facebook post.
That particular article was shared 55 times, "liked" by 572 people, and drew at least 40 comments as of July 3.


Boeing Will Survive an Ex-Im Defeat
Supporters say that killing the government Export-Import Bank would result in "unilateral disarmament" and a painful fall in U.S. exports. But consider the recent conclusions of the financial analysts at Standard & Poor's.
S&P examined what would happen to Ex-Im's biggest client, Boeing , if the bank could no longer provide taxpayer-subsidized financing. S&P estimates Boeing accounted for more than one-third of Ex-Im's financial commitments from 2007 to 2013. "We don't believe that the expiration of Ex-Im's authorization in September would hurt Boeing's credit quality or ability to make planned deliveries in 2014 and 2015," the analysts wrote, citing "the development of more and deeper sources of aircraft financing."
In other words, the private economy is ready, willing and able to provide trade financing to foreign customers to buy Boeing's jets. S&P also examined the effect of cutting off Ex-Im financing to three of the bank's other big clients— General Electric , Caterpillar and United Technologies . The conclusion? Their credit ratings wouldn't be affected because "the amounts financed are generally less than 2% of revenue."
The battle over reauthorizing Ex-Im is turning into a political brawl in which the Fortune 500, with some exceptions, are trying to divide Republicans by fanning fears of economic harm if the bank fades away. As S&P shows, Republicans should have enough confidence in free markets to do the financing job.


U.S. Blames Attack on Rebels
President Barack Obama, faulting Russian President Vladimir Putin's support for separatists, called on Friday for "an immediate cease-fire" in eastern Ukraine to allow for a thorough investigation of the crash by international authorities. (Follow the latest updates on the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine.)
At the crash site in a separatist-controlled part of eastern Ukraine, pro-Russia rebels fired briefly into the air before allowing the first international observers very limited access to the vast field of destruction.


Social Media Carries Tributes to Victims
Building on the social-network discussions on the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 four months ago, two clear emotions have emerged in the aviation community's online response to the disaster of Flight 17: deep sadness for those aboard the ill-fated jet and great anger at those who brought it down.
In blogs, on Internet forums, and in posts on Facebook and Twitter , aviation professionals and aficionados are expressing their shock after 283 passengers and 15 crew perished Thursday when their Boeing 777 was struck by a missile over the war-torn eastern Ukraine region of Donetsk. It is the second catastrophe in recent months for the Malaysian flag carrier, after Flight 370 vanished without a trace on March 8 with 239 people aboard. (Follow the latest updates on the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine.)
"The aviation community is a very close-knit community," said Shubhodeep Pal, a vice president at Singapore-based aviation marketing consultancy SimpliFlying. "They're very supportive" of those affected, he said of the users posting online in recent days. But they are also "angry at the supposed injustice of it all."
Mr. Pal noted that when Flight 370 went missing, people were "flummoxed and scared, but hopeful that it hadn't crashed and that people were alive." This time, "it's just despair and anger."
On Facebook, the world's biggest social network, scores of users who follow a popular page maintained by a U.S. flight attendant wrote to express their solidarity with the crew who perished.


Deaths Top 500 in Gaza
Hamas militants who crossed from Gaza into Israel through a border tunnel killed four soldiers on Monday as the army pressed its two-week assault on the Palestinian territory against a subterranean network far more extensive than Israeli leaders had thought.
Three other Israeli soldiers and dozens of Palestinians died during a day of heavy fighting in Gaza's densely populated cities and along its northern border, raising international pressure on both sides to halt the hostilities. The dead included five Palestinians at a hospital in Deir el-Balah hit by Israeli tank fire and at least 10 Hamas infiltrators in Israel.
U.S. President Barack Obama urged both sides Monday to call a cease-fire, citing "serious concerns" about the growing number of civilian deaths in the fighting in Gaza. "We don't want to see any more civilians getting killed," he said.
Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Cairo to renew support for the Egyptian cease-fire proposal that Israel accepted and Hamas rejected last week.
Israel is pursuing the assault despite its army's heaviest losses since a brief war with the Lebanese Shiite militant and political movement Hezbollah in 2006. Twenty-five Israeli soldiers and two Israeli civilians have been killed during this month's offensive, 20 of the soldiers in the past two days.


Court Assails Poland on CIA Rendition
The European Court of Human Rights unanimously found that Poland violated the European Convention on Human Rights when it allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to hold and torture two men at secret black sites before transferring them to Guantanamo Bay.
The Strasbourg, France, court's ruling on Thursday could further roil the long-troubled military-commissions project at Guantanamo. Pretrial hearings are set to resume there next month for one of the two prisoners in the Poland case, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. He faces capital charges for allegedly organizing the 2000 attack on the USS Cole, which killed 17 sailors.
As part of its ruling, the court directed Poland to use diplomatic pressure to prevent the U.S. from executing Mr. Nashiri, if he is convicted of terrorism charges.
The U.S. has acknowledged excesses in interrogating terrorist suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks, most notably last year when President Barack Obama said that, in some instances, America "compromised our basic values—by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law."
But in proceedings before a Guantanamo military commission, prosecutors have refused to discuss the black sites and fought to prevent defendants from introducing evidence of any abuse they suffered at CIA hands before being charged with crimes.


Risk of Bird Strikes Embroil New Stadium
Bird conservationists in Minnesota are objecting to the building plans for the new Minnesota Vikings stadium, which they say will lead to unnecessary bird deaths due to the type of glass planned for its outer walls.
Audubon Minnesota, a branch of the National Audubon Society, a major player in the world of bird conservation, is asking supporters to press the stadium builders to use safer glass. The new stadium design boasts large, pivoting glass doors as well as a transparent roof.
Matthew Anderson, executive director of Audubon Minnesota, said switching to fritted glass, which uses quarter-inch ceramic dots that reduce reflections and bird strikes, would increase the cost of the nearly $1 billion stadium by about $1.1 million. So far, more than 30,000 people have signed petitions requesting the use of safer glass.
"This [change] is unbelievably reasonable—it's a modest investment and a winner in terms of design, construction and conservation," said Mr. Anderson.
Up to about 1 billion birds are killed annually in the U.S. colliding with buildings, according to Scott Loss, an avian ecologist who published a study on the subject earlier this year. Buildings pose a threat only second to cats, said Mr. Loss, not accounting for climate change or habitat loss. "From the perspective of bird conservation and prevention of collisions, it would seem the measures, independent of cost, would likely significantly reduce the number of bird collisions," said Mr. Loss, who noted that the Minneapolis region is part of an important migratory pathway along the Mississippi River.


Lawmakers Set to Leave a Full Plate
WASHINGTON—Congress loves a deadline. But this year, even that may not be enough.
With just a week left before the start of a five-week August recess, it is increasingly likely that Congress will wrap up for the summer having cobbled together only the bare minimum to keep the government functioning without addressing a list of expiring laws and a pileup of potential national crises.
The two chambers, for example, haven't figured out how to respond to the surge of Central American families crossing the southern border. Lawmakers also had struggled over a bill aimed at mitigating mismanagement and long wait times at Veterans Affairs hospitals, though spokesmen for the top negotiators said Sunday that a deal had been reached.
Virtually no one expected Congress to enact any bold overhauls in the lead-up to November's midterm election. Yet this year lawmakers appear to be punting even on issues that would appear to demand urgency.
"It's bordering on the tragic," said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. "We're just unable to address the country's problems."


Border Surge Complicates GOP Pitch to Hispanics
Republicans have been hunting for ways to reach out to Hispanic voters, but that effort may be complicated as a surge of children crossing the southwestern border has prompted the party to take a tough line on border security and illegal immigration.
Critics from both parties say the push is politically dangerous for the GOP's long-term prospects with this growing bloc of voters, particularly given the House Republicans' decision this year to not take up a broader immigration overhaul, strongly supported by Hispanics. But many Republicans say the child-migration crisis leaves them no choice but to respond forcefully.
The border crisis also has created problems for Democrats. President Barack Obama has urged Congress to speed up deportation proceedings for Central American children who cross the border illegally, a position at odds with many congressional Democrats' views.
At issue is how to respond to the tens of thousands of families and children traveling alone from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border as they flee violence or poverty in their home countries, or seek to reunite with family in the U.S. Republicans have almost uniformly demanded more enforcement, including some who had taken more welcoming positions in the past.
Last week, Texas Gov. Rick Perry vowed to send 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the Mexican border, saying his citizens were "under assault." In 2011, he supported giving young illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates, and told those who disagreed, "I don't think you have a heart."


McDonnell Corruption Trial Focuses on Marriage
RICHMOND, Va.—Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, had a broken marriage that left them vulnerable to a businessman seeking to exploit their power for his own benefit, their attorneys said Tuesday during the opening day of the couple's political-corruption trial.
Mr. McDonnell worked 16-hour days and spent half of his four-year tenure away from the executive mansion, his attorney, John Brownlee, said in his opening statement. Mrs. McDonnell was lonely and uncomfortable in her role as first lady, he said, and developed a relationship with Jonnie Williams Sr., a former chief executive of a dietary supplement business. She even had a crush on the executive, her attorney said.
"Mrs. McDonnell's resentment, anger and sadness grew as their marriage fell apart," Mr. Brownlee told jurors. "She said she hated [Mr. McDonnell], she was angry for not having what she thought was enough money."
"This broke their marriage apart and it created a rift so wide that an outsider—in this case, another man—could invade and poison a marriage," Mr. Brownlee said.
William Burck, Mrs. McDonnell's attorney, said his client was duped by Mr. Williams, who has been granted immunity by the government and will be its star witness.


Report Highlights Dangers of Pilot Fatigue
Federal investigators indicated that fatigue may have been a factor in a 2013 private plane crash in Georgia that killed all five passengers and seriously injured both pilots, in a report highlighting the dangers of tired pilots flying business jets.
The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot of the Beechcraft 390 Premier jet may have been awake for nearly 18 hours when he failed to follow proper landing procedures and then left the landing gear and perhaps the wing panels extended as part of a botched go-round.
The aircraft, carrying a vascular surgeon and four staff members, managed to climb to an altitude of 63 feet when the left wing slammed into a utility pole at the Thomson, Ga., airport and the jet was destroyed in a fireball.
Details suggesting that lack of sleep may have been a factor come as a business-aviation trade group and an independent safety advocacy organization together are urging adherence to new, nonbinding guidelines to combat fatigue among cockpit crews in this industry segment. Stricter limits are particularly important when pilots are on duty between midnight and dawn. For two-pilot crews under such circumstances, the guidelines recommend work days lasting no more than 12 hours, as well as "protected sleep opportunities" when pilots can rest undisturbed.
The safety board's factual report, while stopping short of formally determining the cause of the crash, emphasizes that the experienced, 56-year-old pilot woke up for work around 2 a.m. on Feb. 20, 2013, to ferry the plane to Nashville, Tenn., from Thomson. He told investigators he slept briefly in a pilot lounge around sunrise and then stayed up the rest of the day until getting behind the controls and departing for the return flight to Thomson about 7:30 p.m. His cellphone, though, showed three outgoing calls during the sleep break, according to the report, which was released Tuesday.


Dispute Snarls CIA-Report Release
WASHINGTON—Senators delayed the release of a report criticizing the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation program because of a dispute with the Obama administration over its efforts to ensure that portions of the report remain secret.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the Senate intelligence committee chairman, said Tuesday that the CIA-led process to redact sensitive parts of the still-classified report was excessive and that she was asking the White House and intelligence agencies to make public some of the blacked-out information. Several Democratic senators quickly endorsed her position.
"The redactions eliminate or obscure key facts that support the report's findings and conclusions," Ms. Feinstein said in a statement. "Until these redactions are addressed to the committee's satisfaction, the report will not be made public."
She said she sent President Barack Obama a letter with proposed changes to administration redactions, calling them "necessary prior to public release." She added: "This process will take some time."
A person familiar with the redaction dispute said one issue in contention is whether pseudonyms used by the report to identify CIA officers can be made public. Intelligence officials maintain that pseudonyms can be translated quickly into the true identities of officers and endanger them, this person said, adding that the pseudonyms were used because Ms. Feinstein and the CIA agreed not to identify CIA officers in any public reports.


Pilots Say U.S. Failed to Assess Ukraine Threat
WASHINGTON—U.S. pilot union leaders alleged that federal agencies failed to promptly assess and publicize potential threats posed to airliners flying over eastern Ukraine before the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 last month.
undefinedThe criticism comes as several federal agencies have begun in recent days to look at possible improvements to the process for identifying and responding to significant threats to civilian aircraft, people familiar with the talks said.
Flight 17 was "a watershed event" and was "uniquely different" from other airliners brought down by hostile fire in earlier decades, Mr. Moak said in the interview. As a result of what occurred over Ukraine last month, he said, "the federal government has to come up with a dynamic process" to alert airlines about such future threats.


Toledo Told in Advance of Water Threat
The state of Ohio expressed deep concerns about the safety of Toledo's water supply in the months before a two-day restriction on drinking the water that was caused by a toxin suspected from a Lake Erie algal bloom.
The city's water-treatment plant was "vulnerable to potential failures that could severely impact the city's ability to provide adequate quantities of safe water to its citizens," Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Craig W. Butler wrote in a June 9 letter to Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins.
Later in the letter, Mr. Butler wrote, "I cannot underscore boldly enough the precarious condition of Toledo's drinking water system and the imminent vulnerability to failure." The state also criticized the city's readiness for a crisis like the one last weekend.
At a press conference Friday afternoon, city officials acknowledged some communications failures in their response to the crisis, but said there was no direct connection between the state's June letter about plant deficiencies and the toxin that caused officials to recommend that residents stop drinking tap water. Officials also said they are attempting to shrink what had been a 20-year plan to improve the plant into five years.
The northern Ohio city drew national attention last Saturday when Mr. Collins issued a "do-not-drink" advisory for 500,000 in the city and its suburbs served by the Collins Park treatment plant.


Obama Signals Long U.S. Military Role in Iraq
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama on Saturday signaled the likelihood of an enduring U.S. military involvement in Iraq, but said airstrikes and other aid would only keep a lid on the crisis until the country's leaders form an inclusive government able to confront the threat from extremists.
"Ultimately, only Iraqis can ensure the security and stability of Iraq," Mr. Obama said from the White House's south lawn. "The U.S. can't do it for them."
Mr. Obama spoke to reporters for the first time since the U.S. launched airstrikes in northern Iraq. The president authorized military and humanitarian operations on Thursday to support Kurdish forces trying to halt the Sunni extremist group calling itself the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
The militants are accused of attempting to perpetrate a genocide against the Yazidi religious minority and have threatened to advance on Erbil, the Kurdish capital where American military advisers and diplomats are stationed.
Mr. Obama has pledged only limited involvement and insisted American combat troops won't return to fight in Iraq. But he refused on Saturday to set an end-date for U.S. military operations. Instead, the White House is pressing Iraqi leaders to form a new government that can unite the country's disparate groups and more effectively counter the militants.


Formerly Orthodox, and Struggling for Parental Rights
When Shloime Fisher started his divorce process three years ago, he found the proceedings to be "very civilized." Now, Mr. Fisher said, he faces an uphill battle to broaden his paternity rights.
What has made his situation different from the average soured divorce is that he wasn't only unwinding a marriage—he was divorcing the whole Orthodox Jewish community.
Most New Yorkers reach a divorce agreement through mediators or civil court—usually over several months, with an attorney's help. But those who leave the Orthodox Jewish faith, as Mr. Fisher did, must mediate their divorces through religious leaders, facing agreements that heavily favor the still-devout parent, experts say.
"From a religious perspective, certainly, there is a sense among Orthodox Jews that Jews are born with a special mission as God's chosen people," said Rabbi David Zwiebel, an attorney and executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America, an organization representing devoutly Orthodox Jews. "When a person who has been raised in that tradition walks away, it is considered a tragic outcome."
Mr. Fisher's custody agreement allows him just a few hours with his five children on alternating Sundays.


Jets Paint Themselves Into a Corner
CORTLAND, N.Y.—August isn't halfway over. The regular season doesn't begin for four weeks. And, because of an off-season strategy that hasn't panned out, the New York Jets are already in panic mode.
Their defensive scheme relies on their cornerbacks covering receivers without help from other teammates. As of Monday, their three best cornerbacks were out. Two of them, Dee Milliner and Dexter McDougle, hurt themselves badly during training Sunday. The third, Dimitri Patterson, has missed the past three practices with an ailing quadriceps. And calf. And ankle.
The result was a manic Monday here at training camp. Head coach Rex Ryan experimented with playing Antonio Allen, already a linebacker converted to safety, at cornerback. And the normally unforthcoming general manager John Idzik spoke about the injuries and answered the question that had perplexed Jets fans for months: With your team's plentiful salary-cap space and corps of undistinguished defensive backs, why didn't you sign a star free-agent cornerback this off-season?
Idzik and Ryan gave similar responses. They said the Jets prioritize winning over the long run rather than in the short term.
"I don't think immediate spending translates into winning," Idzik said. "I think responsible spending translates into sustainable winning."


Obama Weighs In on Unrest But Avoids Mention of Race
EDGARTOWN, Mass.—President Barack Obama treaded cautiously into the escalating unrest roiling a St. Louis suburb Thursday, weighing in later than some thought he should and making no mention of the racial undertones that have made 18-year-old Michael Brown's death so explosive.
Under pressure to respond, Mr. Obama interrupted his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to speak for about four minutes about the unarmed black teenager who was shot by a white police officer. In measured remarks, the president urged calm and promised justice—comments that provided a marked contrast to his response a year ago when a Florida jury acquitted a Hispanic man in the shooting death of an African-American teen.
"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago," Mr. Obama said then as he offered candid thoughts about the lens through which many black Americans viewed the case.
On Thursday, with many facts about Mr. Brown's death still unknown, the president walked a delicate tightrope, calling this a heartbreaking loss while declining to draw conclusions amid an ongoing investigation. Mr. Obama's careful response underscored the challenges the first African-American president has faced in calibrating how much and how often to use that distinction to weigh in on issues.
In the Trayvon Martin case, he did that explicitly and personally. As he spoke about Ferguson, Mo., he made no mention at all.


Ferguson Protest March Ends in Chaos
FERGUSON, Mo.—A protest march here ended in chaos when police forced back marchers in a cloud of smoke.
The resulting retreat by marchers—protesting the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, by a white officer—set off widespread vandalism, including a man who took a large rock to break a window at the local McDonald's .
Several people then followed suit by breaking several storefront windows up and down West Florissant Avenue, a main thoroughfare in downtown Ferguson.
The police action began around 9 p.m., shortly after thousands of marchers begin to reach a roadblock just beyond an underpass near a mall.
The pullback of marchers is continuing as police force them down the avenue.


Beltway 'Strip' Club
Not content with the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, President Obama and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) seem determined to make the U.S. even less hospitable to business. Both are developing plans to make it more expensive for multinational companies to invest in America.
Here's the context: Elections to decide control of the U.S. Senate are less than three months away. If those elections were held today, Republicans would likely capture enough seats to reclaim the majority. Eager to avoid discussion of ObamaCare, the VA, the slow-growth recovery, Russia, Iraq, and everything else in the world that has disappointed the President, Messrs. Obama and Schumer want to return to uplifting conversations about greed and envy.
Hence progressive Washington's new outrage over "income stripping." In political terms, this is the fear that somewhere a corporation may be benefiting from a legal tax deduction as it builds a new U.S. factory. Terrifying, we know.
More precisely, Washington's tax collectors fear that foreign firms may fund their U.S. subsidiaries with debt so these U.S. units can deduct the interest payments. The foreign parent companies can then receive these interest payments. With more debt held in the U.S., the firms may be able to boost the profits of their overseas units and pay less in taxes, since taxes are lower nearly everywhere else in the world than in the U.S.


Return of Malaysia's MH17 Victims to Help Start Healing
KUALA LUMPUR—A plane carrying the remains of 20 Malaysians shot down on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine landed here Friday as the Southeast Asia nation planned a day of mourning.
Among the remains of Malaysians killed on Flight 17 returning home are two members of a family of six, a step that will help begin closure for their relatives, a cousin said.
(Latest: Malaysia Honors Flight 17 Victims as Remains Are Returned)
"Having accepted their death as the will of Allah, the next step is to move on," said Azfar Aza, who planned to be at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport when the Malaysia Airlines plane carrying the remains arrived.
"Having their bodies helps us somewhat—it's a start."


Accused Boston Bomber's Lawyers Allege Irregularities in Jury Selection
BOSTON—Lawyers for accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal judge late Friday to dismiss the indictment against him, alleging they found irregularities in how federal juries are selected in the region.
The defense said in new court filings that it found "several violations" during a review of jury-selection records in the District of Massachusetts over the last three years, including underrepresentation of African-Americans and people over age 70. The defense also alleged the court failed to issue replacement summonses for service on the grand jury that indicted Mr. Tsarnaev when some initial summonses were returned as undeliverable.
A spokeswoman for the local U.S. attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mr. Tsarnaev, declined to comment.
The grand jury indicted Mr. Tsarnaev in June 2013, alleging he had helped carry out the deadly marathon attack two months earlier. Three bystanders died when two bombs went off near the finish line and more than 260 people were wounded.
Mr. Tsarnaev, now 21, has pleaded not guilty. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Authorities believe he acted alongside his older brother Tamerlan, who died amid a shootout with law enforcement days after the bombing.


California Farmers Fight Release of Water for Fish
In the latest battle spawned by California's drought, farmers are squaring off against Indian tribes, environmentalists and fishermen over the federal release of water to aid salmon.
At issue is the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's release beginning on Saturday of 25,000 acre-feet of water from Northern California's Trinity Lake to help protect adult Chinook salmon in the Klamath River from contracting a potentially lethal disease that spreads in current low-water conditions.
The agency took the action after a number of scientists warned of the potential for the kind of catastrophic fish kill that claimed tens of thousands of salmon in the Klamath during another drought in 2002.
Farmers in California's Central Valley have decried the action, saying it comes when their allocation of federally managed irrigation water in the state has been cut to zero this year, forcing them to leave fallow hundreds of thousands of acres and furlough employees. One of the hardest-hit agencies, the Westlands Water District, along with its supplier, the San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority, filed a petition this week asking a U.S. District Judge in Fresno, Calif., to halt the release, scheduled to last through Sept. 14.
The judge is expected to make a ruling this week.


Sunni Tribes Join Iraqi Forces in Battle
BAGHDAD—Sunni tribes joined forces with Iraq's Shiite-dominated military, backed by U.S. airstrikes, in a coordinated assault on insurgents, an operation hailed by Iraqi politicians as a model for the cooperation needed to defeat Sunni extremists.
Iraqi and U.S. politicians have said they need the support of Sunni tribal leaders to help resist Islamic State if they hope to reverse the group's significant territorial conquests since June. Sunni politicians, who have typically opposed the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, say the U.S. intervention around Haditha could nudge Sunni tribes to stand with the central government and confront the insurgents.
"This will set a good example for others to do the same thing," Ibrahim Al Mutlaq, a Sunni member of parliament, said of the still-skeptical Sunni tribes. "The security forces themselves can't do it. But with the help of the Sunni tribes themselves, they will be in a better position to get rid of the Islamic State."
At the height of Iraq's sectarian civil strife in 2005-2007, the U.S. military recruited and paid Sunni tribes to carry most of the fight against Islamic State's al Qaeda-linked predecessor. But in the years since, resentment over the Shiite-dominated government's exclusion of Sunnis from power under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki drove some of those tribes to support the Islamic State insurgents earlier in their campaign.


Trial Begins for Gigi Jordan, Accused of Murdering Her Son With Pills
A former Manhattan executive accused of murdering her 8-year-old son with a cocktail of pills did so out of love, not "murderous intent," her attorney said at the start of her trial on Wednesday.
Prosecutors presented a darker side to Gigi Jordan's actions, which aren't in dispute, in February 2010 at the Peninsula New York Hotel in Midtown.
"You'll hear how he was slowly dying," said Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos during opening arguments.
When officers entered room 1603 on the 16th floor of the hotel, they found 5,819 pills, including more than 1000 Xanax tablets and more than 400 Ambien, Mr. Bogdanos said.
Jude Mirra was dead. Ms. Jordan was in a drug-induced stupor on the floor beside him, the prosecutor said. She was charged with murder in the second degree and has pleaded not guilty.


Ties to Scotland Bring Debate to U.S.
Though her ancestors left Scotland in the 12th century, Virginia resident Patricia Reynolds feels such strong kinship for the place that she has become a vocal supporter of Scottish independence.
"This is a nation going for self-determination, with the ability to use its natural resources to benefit its own people," said Ms. Reynolds, a University of Mary Washington assistant education professor. "If that isn't the American way, I don't know what is."
With Scotland set to vote Thursday on whether to end a 307-year-old union with the U.K., Scottish-Americans and Scottish expatriates across the U.S. also are watching—and debating—a campaign that polls suggest is too close to call.
In Scotland, the two sides in the referendum appealed for support Sunday. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who will speak in Scotland on Monday, is expected to make another plea to Scots to reject independence. "There's no going back from this. No re-run. If Scotland votes yes, the U.K. will split, and we will go our separate ways forever," he is expected to say, according to a transcript of excerpts from his speech.
A survey released late Saturday by ICM Research for the Telegraph newspaper put support for independence at 49% of those surveyed with 42% against. Two other surveys put support for the union at 47% in both, versus 43% or 41% and a survey by Panelbase for the Sunday Times also put the union camp slightly ahead.


Debate Stirs As Clinton Returns to Iowa
INDIANOLA, Iowa—With a teasing statement, "It's true I'm thinking about it," Hillary Clinton marked the unofficial start to the 2016 campaign Sunday with the clearest message to date that, while not yet in the race, she will try once more to win the presidency.
Mrs. Clinton's appearance at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual party fundraiser hosted by longtime Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), marked her first visit to Iowa since finishing third in the state's caucuses nearly seven years ago—and showed that the next presidential race has, in essence, begun. Her opening words drew a laugh: "Hello, Iowa! I'm baaack."
But her appearance also fanned a debate among Democrats in Iowa over whether they should use their first-in-the-nation nominating contest—and the rapt attention that draws from candidates—to hash out differences on major issues, or unite behind Mrs. Clinton to give her a running start against Republicans. Some Iowans said that on several issues, they want to push party policy to the left of what they expect to be Mrs. Clinton's stances.
The former first lady, senator and secretary of state made no announcement about her political ambitions but acknowledged her unusual status as a not-yet-candidate who is widely expected to enter, and dominate, the Democratic field.
"I've got a few things on my mind these days," Mrs. Clinton noted to about 7,000 Democrats, as well as 200 reporters, on hand for the Harkin Steak Fry, in remarks carried live on cable television.


Ex-Bloomberg Aides Strike Back Against de Blasio
Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's top aides are pushing back against a fusillade of attacks on his legacy as Mayor Bill de Blasio breaks from many of his predecessor's signature policies.
Former City Hall aides have seethed at the frequent attacks from Mr. de Blasio and his allies, from the moment of the new mayor's inauguration in January when speaker after speaker blasted Mr. Bloomberg as he sat there, jaw clenched.
Now, their private anger appears to have turned into a public campaign to secure Mr. Bloomberg's reputation as the city heads in a new direction.
"I think it's incumbent upon us to respond to factual inaccuracies," said Howard Wolfson, a former deputy mayor and close Bloomberg aide. "He'll be remembered as the best mayor in the city's history."
On Aug. 21, Mr. Wolfson posted a memo on Mr. Bloomberg's website defending a decision by the former mayor to hold out—successfully—against striking school-bus workers last year and create new transportation routes. A de Blasio spokesman had called the policy "unfair and ill-advised" and struck a deal for higher salaries for bus workers.


Iraqi Parliament Rejects Cabinet Nominees
BAGHDAD—Iraq's parliament rejected two appointees to head the critical defense and interior ministries on Tuesday, a sign the prime minister is struggling to set up an inclusive government to better confront Islamic State insurgents.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose cabinet was approved last week with five of 33 seats unfilled, was trying to fill the two top security posts in the government. But the nominations by Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, got bogged down in divisions within rival sects.
The U.S. has pressed politicians in Shiite-majority Iraq to form a government that better represents Sunni and Kurdish minorities, hoping a unified front will be more effective in combating the Sunni extremists of Islamic State who have captured large tracts of territory since June.
The U.S. military, which has conducted more than 150 airstrikes on Islamic State in Iraq since early August, unleashed a new round of attacks near Baghdad early Tuesday local time. The strikes were the first since President Barack Obama announced an expanded mission last week.
The debates over filling the two cabinet posts offered another example of how the pressing need for a political consensus in Iraq has done little to overcome sectarian squabbling. Within Iraq's tightly prescribed sectarian and ethnic political power-sharing, the Ministry of Interior—which controls the police—typically goes to a Shiite Arab.


Brazil's Silva Slightly Widens Lead Over Rousseff in Latest Poll
SÃO PAULO—The latest poll on Brazil's tight October presidential election shows challenger Marina Silva slightly widened her lead over incumbent Dilma Rousseff in voting intentions for the country's October presidential elections, but the two still remain in a statistical dead heat.
Ms. Silva would win the runoff election between the two with 43% of the vote, compared with 40% for Ms. Rousseff, according to the survey by the Ibope polling agency for the Globo television network and the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. In the previous poll by Ibope Ms. Silva led Ms. Rousseff by 43% to 42%. Both surveys have a margin of error of two percentage points.
Brazilian law requires a second round of voting if no candidate gets more than half the valid votes in the first round. There are 11 candidates running for the office.
Ms. Rousseff of the Workers' Party lost some support in the first round as well, with 36%, compared with 30% for Ms. Silva of the Brazilian Socialist Party and 19% for Aécio Neves of the Brazilian Socialist Party. In the previous poll Ms. Rousseff was the choice of 39% of those surveyed, compared with 31% for Ms. Silva and 15% for Mr. Neves.
The first-round election will be on Oct. 5, and a runoff, if necessary, will be held on Oct. 26.


Iran Minister: Islamic State Won't Be Destroyed by Bombings
NEW YORK—Sunni extremist group Islamic State cannot be destroyed by Western bombing attacks, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Wednesday.
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Zarif said the best thing a U.S.-led coalition can do to fight Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS or ISIL, is to cut off the sources of assistance and financial support that go to the extremist group.
He said Iran doesn't trust the U.S.'s willingness to fight Islamic State across the region.
Islamic State "will not be eradicated by aerial bombardments," he said, adding that the threat posed by the group cannot be contained to Iraq and Syria alone. It is "a global threat," he said.
Mr. Zarif said the U.S. cannot successfully fight the Assad regime and Islamic State simultaneously in Syria.


Security Firm at Cooper Union to Leave the School
A security firm hired to boost safety measures at the Cooper Union will leave the college following outcries from students, according to people familiar with the matter.
The chairman of the Cooper Union Board of Trustees informed fellow trustees Wednesday that the school was ending its relationship with the firm, Beau Dietl & Associates, but that B.D.A. security guards would stay until the firm was replaced, the people said.
"The safety and security of our community has been and remains our top priority," said Justin Harmon, a school spokesman, when asked for comment.
Bo Dietl, founder and chairman of the firm, said in an interview that no final decision has been made. "We'll see," he said.
Mr. Dietl, a media pundit and former police detective, said he was frustrated that Cooper students were advocating for his ouster, saying they "have no right" to be involved in the school president's hiring decisions.

Judge Dismisses Suit Over Religious Monument
The privately funded Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Oklahoma Capitol in Oklahoma City doesn't violate the state constitution and can stay there, an Oklahoma County judge ruled Friday. Attorneys who filed the lawsuit vowed to appeal to the state Supreme Court.
District Judge Thomas Prince granted a motion filed on behalf of the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission to block the lawsuit from going to trial.
The 6-foot-tall granite monument was authorized by the Legislature in 2009 and was erected in 2012 after Republican state Rep. Mike Ritze and his family paid nearly $10,000 for it. The monument's placement has led others to seek their own on the Capitol grounds, including a satanic group that earlier this year unveiled designs for a 7-foot-tall statue of Satan.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit on behalf of the Rev. Bruce Prescott of Norman, a Baptist minister, and others who allege the monument's location violated the state constitution's ban against using public property to support "any sect, church, denomination or system of religion."

U.S. Moves Closer to Compliance With Treaty Banning Land Mines
WASHINGTON—The U.S. said it is taking a significant step toward complying with a global treaty banning land mines, pledging to cease the use of antipersonnel land mines everywhere except the Korean peninsula.
Tuesday's policy change builds on an administration policy shift earlier this year, but is fueling tensions with some senior military officers who oppose a move to ban what they view as potentially useful, defensive weapons.
Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel "fully supports" the policy change.
The 15-year-old treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, has been signed by more than 160 nations since 1997, including all U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. China, Russia and the U.S. remain high-profile holdouts.
The Obama administration initially said it would continue with the George W. Bush administration's policy not to join the treaty, but changed course in 2011, when it said it would review the policy.


A Long Shot Who Likes Guns and High Drama
Connecticut gubernatorial candidate Joe Visconti opposes the state's new gun restrictions, and he has an online commercial that shows him riding in a 1974 Pontiac convertible with rifles fixed to the rear fenders.
Mr. Visconti gets out and approaches the camera.
"Remember, what one day is your neighbor's problem could easily become yours," he says, then lifts his coat to reveal a holstered handgun.
"I believe that with all politics, theater is important," said Mr. Visconti, 57 years old, in an interview.
The matchup between Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy and Republican Tom Foley will be the main event in what is expected to be a close general election in November.


Eric Holder's Legacy of Politics
People who complain about gridlock in Washington don't generally mention the Department of Justice. But Thursday's announcement that Eric Holder plans to resign as Attorney General allows us to examine some of the substantive causes of Washington's bitter divisions.
One would be hard put to identify an Attorney General who so explicitly turned the Justice Department into a political weapon, and for an office occupied by Bobby Kennedy and John Mitchell, that is saying something.
The financial settlements that Holder Justice squeezed out of major banks are Exhibit A. Massive fines were imposed on J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America explicitly as punishment for the 2008 financial crisis. No matter how unprovable the charges, the banks settled because they couldn't endure the continuing political risk of even more severe punishment. President Obama bragged about punishing financial institutions throughout his 2012 re-election campaign.
When distinct legal questions about the destruction of emails pertaining to the Internal Revenue Service tax-exempt bias against conservative groups were transferred to Mr. Holder's Justice Department, they disappeared into the bureaucratic ethers. He also managed the unique feat of being declared in contempt of Congress.
Mr. Holder also turned Justice into a routine instrument of social and racial policy. Under the former head of the Civil Rights Division, Thomas Perez (now Secretary of Labor), Justice used "disparate impact" analysis to force racial adjustments on cities, police and fire departments and banks. The settlements were not based on proven racial discrimination, as traditionally required, but on arcane statistical analyses.


Air France Pilot's Strike Remains a Drag on Carrier
PARIS— Air France management and pilots were still at loggerheads Saturday, 13 days into a strike that has forced the airline to cancel more than half of its flights at a cost of several hundred million euros.
The French airline, part of the unprofitable Air France-KLM SA group, said Saturday it would operate only 45% of its flights on Sunday, as talks became deadlocked after management and the government refused to appoint an independent mediator, as requested by the pilots union.
"A mediator should intervene only if talks between the management and its union representatives fall apart. There are still talks," an Air France spokeswoman said on Saturday.
Air France's main pilots union, SNPL France Alpa, didn't respond to a request for comment on Saturday.
Like many airlines in Europe, Air France is struggling to compete with low-cost rivals, such as Ryanair Holdings and easyJet , as leisure travelers pull back on spending.


Berlin Hesitant to Boost Military Budget
BERLIN—Germans learned in recent days that no more than seven of their navy's 43 helicopters can fly, only one of their four submarines can operate, and one in three of their army's weapons systems lack necessary equipment.
The revelations last week in a leaked parliamentary report and acknowledged by German defense officials have led to allegations of mismanagement and media criticism of Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, the first woman to hold the post and a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel. But one response has been slow in coming: calls to increase military spending despite mounting evidence that the German military is falling into disrepair.
The disclosures and the ensuing debate show the limits of promises by German leaders this year—from Ms. von der Leyen to German President Joachim Gauck—that Europe's economic champion will take on more responsibility in world affairs.
Germany has become a greater diplomatic power, particularly in the Ukraine crisis. But despite calls from Western allies that it should beef up its military capabilities, the government's focus on delivering a balanced budget and voters' longtime aversion to the use of force mean German leaders have little incentive to increase military spending.
"People look at all this, laugh a little bit, and say, 'If we had no need for this stuff before, then we won't need it in the future,'" Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University, said of the revelations about defective military equipment. "All this is a consequence of the lack of a discourse about what Germany's increased role after reunification really means."


Iowa Candidate Adjusts Her Message
INDEPENDENCE, Iowa—Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst grabbed national attention earlier this year with a television ad that began, "I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm," and ended with a jab at "big spenders" in Washington: "Let's make 'em squeal."
The homegrown take on cutting government pork not only propelled Mrs. Ernst to victory in Iowa's five-way Republican primary but was celebrated on TV talk shows, political websites and by late-night comedians. "The greatest opening line in the history of campaign commercials," said the conservative National Review Online. Endorsements came in from tea-party standard-bearers such as Sarah Palin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.
But it was a more cautious Mrs. Ernst who appeared before Iowa farmers this month for a campaign speech in her race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Her only reference to her famous line was that "some of you might know we had hogs." She closed with the anodyne promise: "We will do what's best for Iowa agriculture."
Running against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in one of the year's closest Senate races, Mrs. Ernst, a state senator, is now reaching for the political center.
Sunday night, in the first televised debate between the candidates, Mrs. Ernst—whose primary-season ad opposing the Affordable Care Act showed her aiming a handgun—repeatedly referred to the need to "work in a bipartisan manner" on policy that has sharply divided the two parties in Congress. Mr. Braley countered by calling her "a bridge-burner, not a bridge-builder."


Chicago Airport Traffic Rebounding
Flights in and out of Chicago's two main commercial airports Tuesday climbed back to more than 80% of average volume over the past two months, while authorities continued repairs at a damaged air-traffic center for the region.
Also, controllers drafted contingency plans to cope with predicted thunderstorms.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it intended to work with airlines "to provide predictability in arrival and departure rates" despite the continuing outage at the center in Aurora, Ill., which went down Friday after a contract employee allegedly slashed cables and set a fire in the basement housing essential communications gear.
The agency also said work on smoke-damaged areas was going on around the clock, along with installation of communications hardware, cables and other systems. The FAA has said it expects the site to return to full operation by the middle of October.
The FAA has parceled out the damaged center's responsibilities to other air-traffic-control facilities, while routing aircraft passing through the region at high altitudes to other airspace. The former Harris Corp. employee accused of purposely setting the fire cutting cables is in custody.


Comptroller Gives City a 'D' on Push for Minority Contracts
New York City agencies earned a "D" grade in a report issued Wednesday by Comptroller Scott Stringer assessing the city's efforts to award contracts to businesses owned by minorities and women.
In the fiscal year that ended June 30, 3.9% of the city's $17.8 billion procurement budget went to minority- and women-owned firms, according to the report. That is up from 2.7% in fiscal 2013 and down from 5% in fiscal 2012.
The report assigned letter grades to 31 mayoral agencies and the comptroller's own office. Twenty one of the 32 received a "D" or "F." The sanitation, finance and environmental protection departments were among those assigned failing grades. The comptroller gave his own office a "C."
Mr. Stringer, a Manhattan Democrat who planned to run for mayor in 2013 but ended up seeking the lower-profile post he now occupies instead, described the city's record on this issue as "disgraceful."
Increasing the number of minority- and women-owned businesses with government contracts—a goal advanced by elected officials and advocates for two decades—is a "key weapon in our battle against income inequality," said Mr. Stringer, alluding to one of Mayor Bill de Blasio's top campaign themes.


Washington Wire: News Digest
Obama Outlines Policies As Midterms Approach
President Barack Obama on Thursday outlined the economic argument he hopes will carry Democrats through next month's midterm elections, calling for policies such as raising the federal minimum wage to boost a struggling middle class.
"I am not on the ballot this fall," Mr. Obama said in a speech at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. "But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot."
Mr. Obama is trying to balance positive signs in technical indicators of growth, like a lower unemployment rate, with a feeling among many Americans that their lives haven't improved. Raising the minimum wage and extending benefits for the unemployed would narrow that gap, he said.
Congressional Republicans oppose such policies, Mr. Obama said, casting the GOP as a party that backs tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.


NYC Won't Aid Feds' Pursuit of Immigrants
New York City would no longer turn over illegal immigrants in local jails to federal authorities, except in certain limited circumstances, under legislation that would add New York to the list of cities challenging national immigration policies.
The bill will be introduced next week by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and has the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, virtually assuring its passage through the Democratic-controlled City Council.
The proposal would upend more than a decade of the city working closely with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees detainment, deportation and other matters relating to immigrants.
Under the legislation, the New York Police Department and the Department of Correction wouldn't honor detainer requests from ICE unless the request was for an immigrant convicted of a "violent or serious crime" and who was the subject of a warrant issued by a federal judge. ICE's office on Rikers Island would be closed.
Ms. Mark-Viverito said the bill is necessary to lessen New York City's role in a dysfunctional national immigration system that ensnares illegal immigrants in deportation proceedings because of minor offenses.


Putin Foe Aims to Remake Russia
NEW YORK—Russian tycoon and Vladimir Putin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky said he is aiming to bring about a constitutional conference that would shift power away from the Russian presidency and toward the legislature and judiciary.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, a former oil-company chief who crossed Mr. Putin and ended up in jail for a decade before his release last year, said he plans to use his "Open Russia" movement to push for such a conference.
"The question of Russian power won't be decided by democratic elections—forget about this," Mr. Khodorkovsky said in an interview during a trip to the U.S. "This is why, when we speak of strategic tasks, I speak of a constitutional conference that will redistribute power from the president" to other branches of government, he said. Russian officials couldn't be reached to comment on his remarks.
Mr. Khodorkovsky has been speaking out more forcefully against the Kremlin in recent months. He left Russia immediately after Mr. Putin pardoned him in December, and has since said he is "not welcome in Russia." Now living in Switzerland, he said last month he was re-establishing "Open Russia," a foundation he funded before his arrest that aims to strengthen civil society in Russia. The foundation says it is focused on three areas: independent media, political education, and support for political prisoners.
It is unclear how much support Mr. Khodorkovsky's efforts will garner in Russia. His jailing for financial crimes was widely viewed as politically motivated, and his long prison sentence turned him into a dissident in the eyes of some. But other Russians still see him as a symbol of the chaotic Boris Yeltsin years, when the state sold its oil and mining assets to a group of politically connected businessmen, including Mr. Khodorkovsky, at knock-down prices.


Man Who Arrived in Newark on Brussels Flight Doesn't Have Ebola
A man who arrived Saturday aboard an international flight in Newark, N.J., suffering from Ebola-like symptoms was found not to have the deadly virus, authorities said.
"After an examination by physicians at University Hospital, the symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," said Tiffany L. Smith, a spokeswoman for Newark's University Hospital, where the man was tested.
The 35-year-old passenger, traveling with his daughter on a flight from Brussels, arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport at 12:15 p.m. EDT. He had vomited on the flight. He and his daughter both underwent testing, officials said.
Both were taken to University Hospital where they were undergoing evaluation Saturday. The man's daughter showed no symptoms for the virus, officials said.
"The second individual, who was traveling with the patient, was asymptomatic," said Ms. Smith, who added that the father and his daughter would be released from the hospital but undergo further monitoring.


An Early Ballot Education
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for an Ohio voting law to go into effect, staying a preliminary injunction against the law on a 5-4 vote. The bad news is that the Court was only one vote away from endorsing a theory that a mere reduction in early voting discriminates against minority voters.
Yet Ohio still offers one of most generous early-voting periods in the country and continues to let voters cast absentee ballots without requiring an excuse for why they can't make it to the polls. But rather than compare the state's new voting periods to a universal standard or other state, Judge Economus made the elementary mistake of merely comparing Ohio's new law to the old law.
That misses the big picture. If limiting early voting to 28 days represents a substantial burden on minority voters in Ohio, what about the 14 states that allow no early voting? According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those states include such right-wing strongholds as New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Delaware.
Democrats argue that the more early voting days there are, the better for minorities. The argument is more than a little patronizing, but it also ignores that a few decades ago early voting didn't exist. It also wasn't included in the pantheon of protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.


U.K. Party Opposing EU Wins First Seat
LONDON—The U.K. Independence Party won its first elected seat in Britain's parliament with a resounding victory in a by-election on England's east coast, dealing a blow to Prime Minister David Cameron and highlighting the growing threat the euroskeptic party poses with seven months to go before the general elections.
Douglas Carswell, who had held the seat for Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party since 2005 but defected to UKIP in August, took 21,113 votes, or 60% of the total cast, results showed early Friday. That was more than double the 8,709 votes won by the Conservative candidate in the by-election that took place on Thursday, Mr. Cameron's birthday. The center-left opposition Labour Party candidate finished a distant third, with 3,957 votes.
The victory highlights the threat that UKIP, which wants Britain to withdraw from the European Union, could draw votes away from the Conservatives in May's general elections and make it harder for Mr. Cameron to win a second term. It also provides UKIP with the credibility of having its first elected representative in Westminster and gives it a national platform ahead of 2015.
In a sign that UKIP is also increasingly challenging Labour in its heartland, the party finished a close second in another by-election on Thursday in the northwestern English constituency of Heywood and Middleton. Labour beat UKIP in that contest, which was triggered by the death of the sitting Labour parliamentarian, by just 617 votes.
U.K. voters frequently take advantage of midterm by-elections to register displeasure with incumbent parties, making the contests an unreliable guide for what will happen in a general election. Nevertheless, the Heywood and Middleton result suggests UKIP is making headway on its plan to also draw support from Labour, having said it wants to woo blue-collar workers away from the center-left opposition party.


Attorney Rubenstein Loses Another Client
Another client has turned away from attorney Sanford Rubenstein.
Sandra Amezquita, the pregnant Brooklyn woman who says she was thrown to the pavement stomach first by New York City police officers, has now retained civil-rights attorney Norman Siegel, according to a family representative.
Mr. Siegel said Ms. Amezquita's family approached him last week. "She wanted to focus on getting justice for herself and her family," he said.
Ms. Amezquita's decision to drop Mr. Rubenstein comes a week after the family of Eric Garner replaced Mr. Rubenstein with another civil-rights attorney, Jonathan Moore. Mr. Garner, 43, died July 17 after he was put in an apparent chokehold by an NYPD officer who was arresting him for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes.
Mr. Rubenstein, 70 years old, had represented the family until a high-ranking official affiliated with the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network filed a complaint with police alleging that Mr. Rubenstein sexually assaulted her at his apartment after the reverend's birthday party. Mr. Rubenstein, through his lawyer, has denied any wrongdoing.


In Healing City, Some See New Scar
DETROIT—Construction projects in this troubled city's downtown are generally seen as signs of rebirth. But a half-built jail near some of the area's biggest attractions has emerged as a symbol of alleged corruption, cost overruns and a brewing spat between elected officials and one of the city's biggest boosters.
Last year, amid skyrocketing costs and after sinking about $157 million into the project, officials halted construction. This past week, a county commission took steps that could restart construction, reigniting debate.
The row comes as a number of cities, including Indianapolis and Nashville, are looking to move inmates away from resurgent downtowns, and even as the Motor City seeks to attract new businesses and investors as it emerges from municipal bankruptcy protection.
Billionaire Dan Gilbert, who moved his Quicken Loans company headquarters to Detroit in 2010, says the plan to build a jail so close to the resurgent downtown "would rank among this region's worst decisions of all-time."
"It is unfathomable there is even a thought of continuing on with a project that would put a massive county jail at the foot of the entry to downtown," Mr. Gilbert wrote in a blog post last month.


Hong Kong Government, Protesters Set to Meet
HONG KONG—The government on Saturday agreed to hold talks next week with student leaders, handing a small victory to protesters who have refused to end over three weeks of street demonstrations aimed at winning democratic concessions from Beijing.
The city's No. 2 official, Carrie Lam, said she would hold two-hour, televised talks Tuesday with student protest leaders, in what would be the first face-to-face meeting between the two camps.
The government unilaterally canceled discussions earlier this month, which appeared to be part of a strategy of allowing students to continue to block major Hong Kong roads and hoping public opinion would turn against them.
Although attendance at protests has dwindled at times, students have continued to rally supporters at night and held on to barricades that block key arteries in this city of seven million.
The persistence of the protesters has forced police to back off from attempts in recent days to reopen roads, and now the government is saying it is willing to go to the negotiating table.


The Parliament of Palestine
The vote this week by the British Parliament to recognize a Palestinian state is being treated as a nonevent by diplomats in both Jerusalem and London. Though the margin of 274 to 12 was lopsided in favor of recognition, more than half the Parliament either abstained or didn't show up. The nonbinding resolution will have no effect on Britain's longstanding policy of recognizing a Palestinian state only in the context of an agreed two-state solution.
But symbolism can also be revealing. Some of the revelations came in comments by the MPs. Andrew Bridgen, a Tory, offered the view that the U.S. was "very susceptible to well-funded powerful lobbying groups and the power of the Jewish lobby in America." David Ward, a Liberal Democrat, tweeted that he'd fire rockets at Israel if he were living in Gaza.
The mindset such statements betray speaks for itself. It is particularly disturbing after a summer that witnessed eruptions of anti-Semitic venom on Europe's streets.
It also prompts the question of where these MPs get their news. Hamas began the war with indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israel, and the terror group continued it by routinely violating ceasefires agreed by Israel. If this elicited moral indignation by the pro-Palestinian MPs, we're unaware of it.
Meanwhile, ISIS is at the gates of Baghdad and Bashar Assad continues to starve his enemies into submission—realities Palestinian statehood does nothing to fix. It's been a long time since Britain's voice counted in the Middle East, which may explain the recourse to meaningless gestures. Too bad even those gestures are wrong.


French Cuisine Worth the Search
Entrees aside, the appetizers are wonderful. With the pot de fromage ($15) diners get a Parmesan custard to spread on crispy bread that has already been toasted with anchovy butter. Add some radish and "it's kind of like an umami bomb because of the mix of anchovy and cheese—it's rich," says Mr. McBride. For dessert, ultrathin crepe suzettes ($10) come drizzled with an orange liqueur.


Turkey to Open Passage to Kobani
ISTANBUL—Turkey responded to U.S. pressure and allowed Iraqi Kurdish forces to cross its territory to reinforce the Syrian Kurdish militia in the besieged city of Kobani, a striking reversal for a country that had considered those fighters its enemy.
The shift came hours after American aircraft dropped weapons for the first time to supply the militia in Kobani after American officials informed Turkey of their intention, demonstrating the U.S. would help those forces without Ankara's assent.
Syrian Kurdish commanders warmly welcomed the U.S. help and said it could significantly shift the dynamics on the battlefield in their favor, and foster closer relations with Washington and its allies as the Middle East map continues to be redrawn.
"This is a turning point that will set the foundation for better ties in the future," said Aldar Khalil, senior leader in the Social Democratic Movement, an umbrella group for Syrian Kurdish parties. "This is a huge deal," Mr. Khalil told The Wall Street Journal.
Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat now at the Carnegie Endowment in Brussels, said Turkey's shift stemmed from desire to repair frictions with Washington over how to tackle Islamic State. It also aimed to bolster Ankara's faltering peace process with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, in Turkey, which has been imperiled by the crisis in Kobani.


Christie Hits Democrats on Minimum Wage
WASHINGTON—For the better part of a year Democrats have made increasing the federal minimum wage a core talking point, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has had enough.
"I gotta tell you the truth," Mr. Christie said on Tuesday. "I'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I really am. I don't think there's a mother or father sitting around a kitchen table tonight in America who is saying, 'You know what, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, you know what, all our dreams would be realized.' "
Mr. Christie, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, dismissed President Barack Obama's focus on income inequality and raising the minimum wage during a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here. The president has proposed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25 an hour, which if passed would be the first increase since 2009.
Democrats on Tuesday immediately pounced on the remarks by a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender.
The Democratic National Committee's Mo Elleithee noted on Twitter that Mr. Christie is paid $175,000 a year.


Sanctions on Russia to Stay in Place, Merkel Says
BRUSSELS—A cease-fire between Ukrainian troops and Russia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine isn't being fully observed and thus European Union sanctions against Russia must remain in place, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters early Friday morning.
Ms. Merkel is a decisive figure in European decisions on sanctions against Russia, in part because of Germany's close economic ties with Europe's giant eastern neighbor. Her remarks show that tensions over Ukraine are far from being defused, despite the cease-fire deal reached in Minsk at the beginning of September.
"When you've had more than 200 people killed you cannot say the cease-fire has been accepted," she said at a news conference after an EU summit here that began on Thursday evening.
Ms. Merkel said she was particularly worried about upcoming local elections in the rebel-held provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk.
"That is something that would establish facts on the ground that would not comply with Ukrainian law," she said.


Ottawa Shooter's Mosque Ties Probed
Leaders of a Muslim association in British Columbia said Friday Canadian authorities questioned them about a suspected radical who attended a suburban Vancouver mosque during the same period as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who killed a soldier guarding Canada's National War Memorial on Wednesday.
Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau, who was killed after opening fire in the Parliament building, was a regular attendee at the Masjid al-Salaam mosque in Burnaby, a leafy Vancouver suburb, for several months in late 2011 and possibly early 2012, according to a mosque official. A man police have identified as a suspected radical, Hasibullah Yusufzai, attended the mosque about the same time.
Both men vocalized disagreements with the mosque leadership about its policies, and were told to leave if they couldn't accommodate the congregation's more mainstream views. Mr. Yusufzai openly espoused "extremist views," said mosque representatives. About two years ago, he began pulling pictures off the mosque's bulletin board, saying visual representations were un-Islamic, according to a worshiper who declined to be named.
The person said Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was friendlier and would sometimes sit talking about religion, often in fluent Arabic.
Mr. Yusufzai was charged in July under a new Canadian law making it illegal to travel to another country to try to commit an act of terrorism. Authorities allege he traveled to Syria earlier in the year. Relatives still in Canada have denied the charge against Mr. Yusufzai.


Man Beheads Mother, Kills Self, Police Say
A Long Island man killed his mother with a knife and dragged her decapitated body into the street before he was fatally struck by a train a short time later in a murder-suicide, Nassau County police said Wednesday.
A person called 911 about 8 p.m. Tuesday after finding the body of Patricia Ward, a 66-year-old college professor, outside her apartment building in the village of Farmingdale, said police Detective Lt. John Azzata.
About 25 minutes later, her son, 35-year-old Derek Ward, deliberately stepped in front of an eastbound Long Island Rail Road train and was killed, Lt. Azzata said.
He said police considered it a murder-suicide.
Mr. Ward had a history of psychiatric problems dating back at least 10 years, and they were exacerbated by the August 2013 death of his paternal grandfather, police said.


In New Hampshire, Distracted Voters
MANCHESTER, N.H.—New Hampshire is again a political bellwether, but this time, it's exemplary of voters' distraction and worry in advance of a Tuesday vote many of them may skip.
In Milly's Tavern, a gaggle of Democratic volunteers gathered Monday night for what one of them jokingly called the 2,000th televised debate between Democratic incumbent Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and Republican Frank Guinta. Even though there was free food, just a dozen people turned up.
Rae Pierson, who'd just come out to meet a friend for a drink, sat at the bar with her back to the group, watching Ebola news of the day.
"I'm a little frustrated," she said, nursing a microbrew beer. She's a single, 33-year-old mother of two with student loans. She can't get a job in her field but earns too much to qualify for government aid. She doesn't think local schools are good enough. And she works for a limousine service that picked up a passenger who'd been screened for Ebola. "Yuck. That car was completely sanitized," she said.
Ms. Pierson isn't convinced anyone, much less a political candidate, is a solution. Her choices for Congress and Senate this year might well be "Blank," she said.


Notable & Quotable
From a new report for the Institute of Modern Russia, "The Menace of Unreality: How the Kremlin Weaponizes Information, Culture and Money," by Peter Pomerantsev and Michael Weiss:
Russia has hybridized not only its actual warfare but also its informational kind. Much of the epistemology democratic nations thought they had permanently retired after the Cold War needs to be re-learned but adapted to even cleverer forms of propaganda and disinformation. The wisdom of Orwell must be combined with the savvy of Don Draper. . . .
How does one fight a system that embraces Tupac and Instagram but compares Obama to a monkey and deems the Internet a CIA invention? That censors online information but provides a happy platform to the founder of WikiLeaks, a self-styled purveyor of total "transparency"? That purports to disdain corporate greed and celebrates Occupy Wall Street while presiding over an economy as corrupt as Nigeria's? That casts an Anschluss of a neighboring country in the grammar of both blood-and-soil nationalism and anti-fascism? This is why American social reactionaries, Australian anarchists, British anti-imperialists and Hungarian neo-Nazis all find so much to favor in the application of Putinism, at home and abroad. Putinism is whatever they want it to be.


Hong Kong Protesters Arrested After Clashes
HONG KONG—Hong Kong police have arrested three men following clashes early Thursday in Mong Kok, a pro-democracy protest zone in the Kowloon part of the city.
Local television stations showed police using pepper spray on dozens of protesters in the working-class neighborhood. The confrontation was allegedly caused by a man using a camera flash to provoke a police officer, the news channels said.
A Hong Kong police spokesperson confirmed that three men—aged between 24 and 50—were arrested. One was arrested for suspicion of criminal damage, while the other two were arrested for obstructing police officers executing their duty. One was also taken to the hospital with a head injury, the police said in a statement. No other information on the men was immediately available and it wasn't clear if anyone else was injured in the clashes.
The pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are in their sixth week, but there is little sign of resolution. Sunday, protesters are planning to march west from the business district on Hong Kong Island to the Chinese government's Liaison Office. They say they will call for talks with China's government. The march has been organized by the Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group affiliated with most of the pro-democracy camps in the city.
Members of the Hong Kong Federation of Students have threatened to bring their protest to Beijing during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, as a way to gain publicity for their demand that China allow free elections in Hong Kong.

FBI Director Says Agent
Posed as AP Reporter
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said an agent impersonated an Associated Press reporter during a 2007 criminal investigation, a ruse the news organization says could undermine its credibility.
In a letter Thursday to the New York Times , Mr. Comey said the agent "portrayed himself as an employee of the Associated Press" to help catch a 15-year-old suspect accused of making bomb threats at a high school near Olympia, Wash.
Kathleen Carroll, executive editor of the AP, said the FBI's actions were "unacceptable."
"This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of the Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press," Ms. Carroll said in a statement.


U.S. Targets ISIS Leaders
WASHINGTON—The U.S.-led coalition conducted airstrikes Friday evening in Iraq targeting a group of what was assessed to be Islamic State leaders near Mosul, a defense official said.
The strikes destroyed a vehicle convoy, which included 10 armed trucks, but the official couldn't confirm if Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was among the leaders present.
"This strike demonstrates the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL terrorist network and the group's increasingly limited freedom to maneuver, communicate and command," the official said, using an alternate acronym for the organization.
On Friday, President Barack Obamarequested $5.6 billion from Congress and authorized the deployment of 1,500 additional troops to Iraq to expand the fight against Islamic State and train Iraqi military forces.

Series of Failures Enabled White House Breach, Report Finds
WASHINGTON—An intruder was able to get over the White House fence and into the mansion in September because of a cascading series of failures, including unclear radio transmissions, bushes that didn't provide the barrier the Secret Service thought they would and a distracted agent on a personal cellphone, an internal review of the incident found.
The findings are the result of a review of the incident by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and were presented privately to congressional officials Thursday. The review found faults in an array of areas, including communications, training, staffing decisions and intelligence.
The findings, which portray the U.S. President's protectors as falling victim to a series of Keystone Kops moves, threatens to further damage the agency's reputation. The intrusion has already led to the resignation of Secret Service director Julia Pierson and prompted Homeland Security to appoint a panel to examine broader issues at the Secret Service.
"Based on these initial findings the Secret Service has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, a series of training, staffing, communication, tactical and intelligence gathering enhancements," the Secret Service said. "We must take this opportunity to make any necessary changes and improvements related to carrying out our protective mission to regain the trust of the American people."


U.S. Probes Abuse-of-Power Claims
WASHINGTON—Internal watchdogs at two federal agencies will examine whether U.S. officials abused their power in conducting a broad investigation into alleged fraud in the financial system tied to scammers and online lenders, according to letters sent to a U.S. House lawmaker this month.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s inspector general and a Justice Department office that investigates allegations of improper conduct by department lawyers have opened up separate inquiries into how regulators conducted a crackdown on alleged fraud schemes.
The inquiries are the latest fallout from a federal push against financial fraud, which industry critics say goes too far and is hurting legitimate companies.
Bank regulators in recent years have been stepping up warnings to banks to keep close watch over payment firms that work with certain types of merchants, such as payday lenders, escort services and gun dealers, over concerns about fraudulent or illicit behavior.
Industry groups and congressional Republicans, however, say the government is trying to force banks to sever ties to politically unpopular industries. Banks earn money by charging fees to such payment firms, which in turn provide thousands of merchants with access to the U.S. financial system.


President Orders Review of U.S. Hostage Policies
WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is undertaking a review of how it handles cases of U.S. citizens held captive by extremists abroad, according to a letter from a top Pentagon official made public Monday, a move that follows criticism from some relatives of slain Americans.
The review, according to the Pentagon letter, is designed to improve interagency coordination in hostage cases and will examine intelligence-collection efforts and how the government engages with family members.
Some friends and family members of American hostages have been critical of the administration's efforts both to secure the captives' freedom and to communicate with relatives. The mother of James Foley, who was killed by militants in August, said the government "failed" her son.
On Sunday, Islamic State militants released a video showing the death of the latest American hostage to be beheaded, Peter Kassig, an aid worker and former U.S. soldier also known as Abdul Rahman. He was the third American hostage in recent months to be killed by members of the militant group Islamic State.
In a letter, Christine Wormuth, the under secretary of defense for policy, and one of the Pentagon's most senior officials, said the review was prompted by a rise in hostage-taking.


Hong Kong Protests Turn Violent
HONG KONG—Scuffles erupted overnight here as protesters tried to break in to the city's legislature, hours after authorities took their first step in weeks to dislodge demonstrators from their encampments.
Some pro-democracy protesters started to gather late Tuesday night around the Legislative Council building, trying to rally support from larger groups of protesters at the main protest site in Admiralty to occupy the building and block lawmakers from going in the next day. (Latest News:Hong Kong Protesters Divide)
With the doors to the building locked, however, a group of protesters smashed a glass door and windows with bricks and damaged the metal barricades in the driveway area of the legislature, where dozens of tents have been pitched. Protesters didn't move into the building, but the government canceled morning meetings because of the overnight unrest.
The actions mark a significant escalation in violence after weeks of near inaction from protesters and the government and could further erode public support for the movement, which has seen pro-democracy protesters occupy three areas in Hong Kong for more than 50 days. The protesters haven't won any concessions on their main demand of full public nomination for the chief executive post in 2017, as opposed to only being able to vote for candidates screened by Beijing.
The protesters' actions overnight come after authorities cleared a small area in compliance with a court injunction, with further clearances expected at another protest site on Wednesday—though by midday no further government action had taken place.


Ancient Prophecies Motivate Islamic State
Rebels of the moderate Free Syrian Army were mystified in August when rival Islamic State militants suddenly took aim at a seemingly unimportant string of villages in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo.
As the extremist group's propaganda and fighters on the ground quickly made clear, what fueled their offensive was one village in particular. The village, Dabiq, appears in sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad as the location of an end-of-days drama in which a Muslim army is to defeat its enemies, including a foreign army.
The importance of this prophecy to Islamic State was also evident in the video released on Sunday announcing the beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig.
"Here we are, burning the first American crusader in Dabiq, eagerly waiting for the remainder of your armies to arrive," says a militant in the video. The militant denounces U.S. intervention in Iraq and vows to defeat what he calls "this final and last crusade."
The capture of Dabiq set the stage for Islamic State's wider battles spanning Syria and Iraq, which it portrays as preordained in Islamic texts. That an ancient prophecy prompted a strategic battlefield shift some 1,400 years after it was relayed shows how apocalyptic ideas have animated and fueled the rise of Islamic State.


Bronx Man Charged in Fatal Subway Push
A Bronx man, who authorities said has a long record of criminal convictions, has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a man pushed in front of a moving subway train.
Kevin Darden, 34 years old, was ordered held without bail Wednesday evening after his arraignment on a second-degree murder charge in Bronx Criminal Court. He didn't enter a plea.
His attorney, Edward McGowan, asked the public not to jump to conclusions about his client. "Kevin Darden is a human being," Mr. McGowan said. "He is not a monster."
The charges stem from a Sunday morning incident that chilled New York City subway riders: Wai Kuen Kwok was pushed in front of a southbound D train as it was pulling into the 167th Street station in the Bronx, police said. Mr. Kwok, 61, died.
The New York Police Department said Mr. Darden also is suspected in a Nov. 6 incident in which a 51-year-old Brooklyn man was pushed while standing on the platform at the West Fourth Street subway stop in Manhattan. The man fell, suffering injuries to his back and hand, and the suspect ran off. No charges have been filed.


Obama Announces Moves to Overhaul Immigration
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama announced Thursday that millions of illegal immigrants will gain protections from deportation, bypassing Congress and unleashing unpredictable political and economic forces.
"What I'm describing is accountability—a common-sense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported," Mr. Obama said in describing his executive action.
Republicans criticized the move as presidential overreach. "The action he's proposed would ignore the law, would reject the voice of the voters, and would impose new unfairness on law-abiding immigrants—all without solving the problem," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).
Mr. Obama said his move was well-grounded in law and precedent and challenged Republicans to pass a bill if they don't like it. He noted contributions immigrants make to the nation, and said it was neither realistic nor desirable to deport all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants.


Law and Evidence Tilted in Ferguson Police's Favor
A grand jury spent three months determining what happened Aug. 9, when Officer Darren Wilson shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Their deliberations—which led to no charges—were shaped by several factors, including a law that gives officers broad leeway to use deadly force when they think their lives are in jeopardy, and physical evidence that supported the officer's narrative.
Prosecutors may have made an indictment even less likely, some legal experts said, by throwing volumes of evidence at the grand jury rather than tailoring it to present a more compelling argument. Prosecutors denied the accusation and said they wanted to present all available evidence to be fair.
The case took on growing symbolic importance as another flashpoint in the volatile history of young black men and white police officers in America. But inside the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office in Clayton, Mo., the focus was on the law and the evidence. And in this case, much of it tilted the field in favor of the police.
The general law of self-defense in Missouri and the rest of the U.S. allows the use of deadly force when someone fears that life, or that of another person, is in danger. When such cases involve police, prosecutors and jurors often are asked whether an officer acted "reasonably," while keeping in mind such decisions are often made quickly and under strain.
The legal standard for police "allows for the possibility of a nonnegligent mistake," said Robert Weisberg, co-director of the criminal justice center at Stanford Law School. "It signals that police officers are supposed to get a special amount of deference."


Canada Resident Caught Up in China Probe
In January, John Jia traveled from Canada to Shanghai to attend a friend's wedding, which he told his Instagram followers would be the "best wedding ever."
Eleven months later, the 21-year-old has yet to return home to Canada after being swept up in Beijing's spreading anticorruption investigation, which has already implicated dozens of officials in China and reached into the operations of its state-run enterprises abroad.
Mr. Jia told friends in a Facebook message in January that he has been unable to leave China after being placed on a "no fly/exit list" due to an investigation into his uncle, a "very powerful and high ranking politician."
That uncle is one of the Communist Party's most senior figures: Zhou Yongkang, according to several people familiar with the matter. Mr. Zhou, a former domestic security chief who once ran China National Petroleum Corp., is being investigated for "serious disciplinary violations," according to China's state media.
The Wall Street Journal earlier this year found that Mr. Zhou's family members and friends forged ties with CNPC and amassed holdings in the petroleum, investment and media sectors worth tens of millions of dollars. State media has said the state-run oil company's subsidiaries are being probed for embezzlement and inspected for evidence of "private coffers."


The FCC's Taxman Cometh
If there's an upside to President Obama's executive overreach, it's that Congressional Republicans can reassert their constitutional powers. A good place to start would be reclaiming taxing authority from the bureaucracy, starting at the Federal Communications Commission.
FCC chief Tom Wheeler illustrated the problem last week when he announced an expansion to E-rate, an Al Gore-era program tucked in the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Originally sold to connect students to the "information superhighway," E-rate uses taxpayer money to subsidize telephone and Internet service to rural schools and libraries. It's funded out of the Universal Service Fund, or USF.
Mr. Wheeler wants to increase E-rate's spending cap to $3.9 billion from its current $2.4 billion to hook up high-speed broadband access and give students the "tools they need to compete in a global economy"—and he'll pay for it by raising the USF levy on every U.S. telephone customer by 16 cents a month. Or as Mr. Wheeler put it, "the equivalent of one cup of coffee or one medium soda at McDonald's per year."
The FCC already levies a 16.1% assessment on interstate and international telecom revenues for the USF, of which about a quarter was spent on E-rate last year. Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai says Mr. Wheeler's plan represents a 17.2% tax increase and suggests instead that the agency reform E-rate and "focus resources on the children and library patrons of poor and rural America, where the need is greatest." But Mr. Pai is stymied because the FCC has a 3-2 Democratic majority.

Ex-President Defends
Narrower Election Win
Former President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday rushed to bolster support for his election as chairman of France's conservative UMP party after failing to garner an expected landslide victory.
The vote, which concluded Saturday, was intended to serve as a triumphal backdrop for the former leader's political comeback.
Instead, Mr. Sarkozy, who lost the presidency to François Hollande in 2012, failed to muster overwhelming support from rank-and-file party members.
He took 64.5% of the vote, as Bruno Le Maire—formerly Mr. Sarkozy's agriculture minister—turned a recent surge in popularity and profile into a 29.18% share of the vote.


Denying Espionage to the Grave
Miriam Moskowitz is expected to be at U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, to hear if the court will rule in favor of her petition to reverse a verdict against her in 1950. At that time, she and her employer, Abraham Brothman, were found guilty of obstructing justice during an investigation of Soviet espionage. She served two years in the Woman's Reformatory in Alderson, W.Va., and paid a $10,000 fine.
Ms. Moskowitz has been getting a lot of publicity the past few weeks, including a sympathetic article in the Los Angeles Times and an interview on National Public Radio that cast her as another victim of McCarthyism.
The problem is that Ms. Moskowitz is suffering from what might be termed Alger Hiss syndrome, in which those who were secretly Communist Party members and guilty of aiding the Soviet Union in obtaining classified secrets proclaim their innocence to their dying days. Ms. Moskowitz also wants, as one media story put it, "to remind Americans of the horrors of the Red Scare." Actually, this may be a good moment to remind Americans that there were real Communists in the U.S., and that many were loyal to the Soviet Union.
The evidence indicates that Ms. Moskowitz was guilty of conspiring to hide facts about espionage from a grand jury in 1947. Here are the facts:


Royal Couple Visit New York
Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge arrive in New York on Sunday for an itinerary packed with photo ops and receptions. But they also might have time for a little fun.
On Monday night, the British royals will be hanging out where some of America's pop royals, Beyoncé and Jay Z, are regulars: Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where the Brooklyn Nets will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Earlier in the day, William will head to Washington, D.C. He will meet with President Barack Obama at the White House before returning to New York.
The former Kate Middleton, who is pregnant with the couple's second child, will remain in New York. She is slated to accompany Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, on a visit to a child-development center in Harlem, where they will meet students and wrap holiday gifts.
Also Monday, the prince hosts a reception for Tusk, a wildlife-conservation program. He has been its patron since 2005.


Protesters Converge on Barclays Center
Several hundred protesters massed outside Barclays Center on Monday night, blocking traffic and clogging entrances to the Brooklyn arena as ticket holders attempted to get to their seats for a basketball game attended by Britain's Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.
Some protesters staged a "die-in," lying down outside the arena. Hundreds of demonstrators also streamed into the nearby Atlantic Terminal Mall, protesting the decision by a Staten Island grand jury not to indict a white police officer in the apparent chokehold death of Eric Garner, who was black.
More than 100 demonstrators entered a nearby mall and staged a second die-in outside a Target store. Most of the stores in the mall had already closed. Police said there was one arrest during the mostly peaceful protest.
At about 10:30 p.m., demonstrators surrounded a police car on Atlantic Avenue and began draping their signs onto its windshield. The officer ran his siren, and several patrolmen shooed them away.
New York City police said the demonstrations caused no problems for the royal visit, and the prince and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, were seen on a giant screen apparently enjoying themselves in courtside seats during the game between the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers.

Senate Democrats Seek to Create New Office
Democratic lawmakers in the New York state Senate introduced legislation Tuesday to create an office designed to review cases involving the killing of an unarmed civilian by a police officer, the latest in a series of actions to address the events surrounding the death of Eric Garner.
In addition to the creation of such an office, the state Senate Democratic Conference proposed that Gov. Andrew Cuomo direct roughly $75 million in his 2015-2016 executive budget to reimburse state and local law-enforcement agencies that purchase body cameras.
The proposals by the Senate Democrats come after Mr. Cuomo's own pledges to introduce a package of criminal justice changes in the next legislative session, due to start in January, and after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman petitioned Mr. Cuomo for authority to investigate deaths of unarmed citizens at the hands of police.

Value of Coercive Tactics Is Hotly Debated
The question of the effectiveness of the CIA's harsh interrogation methods is central to the Senate intelligence committee report. Yet the report, the product of Democratic staff members, and the CIA response to it show the difficulty of definitively proving which side is right.
The nonlinear nature of intelligence collection makes it tough to demonstrate that information resulted—or didn't—from a particular technique.
The investigation reviewed 20 in-depth case studies to gauge the effectiveness of the methods, which the committee defined based on standards that CIA had set: that the techniques were necessary to produce intelligence that would save lives and that couldn't have been produced any other way.
The investigation found that no case fully met the standard. The CIA strongly disputes that conclusion.
"The committee found that the CIA's coercive interrogation techniques were not an effective means of acquiring accurate intelligence or gaining detainee cooperation," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairwoman of the intelligence panel.


Christie's Cowboys Support Rankles Some New Jersey Residents
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie usually has a loyal ally in Matt Rooney, a prominent conservative blogger who often defends the Republican governor from attacks.
After seeing Mr. Christie high-five Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones Sunday night and celebrate the Cowboys' win over the Philadelphia Eagles, he joked that he might have to reconsider his support.
"If there's one thing I can't stand more than a Clinton, it's a Cowboys fan," Mr. Rooney said. "It just broke my heart to see him in the Cowboys box."
Mr. Christie took a deeply unpopular position in New Jersey Sunday night. He pulled for the Cowboys, who are NFC East division rivals with two teams with New Jersey fan bases: the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants. New Jersey isn't exactly known as a hotbed for Cowboys fans.
"I only know three of us," said Jim Bailey, an emergency-medical services worker in Avalon and Cowboys fan who watched the game alone.


U.S. Pays $157 Million to Restart Colorado Hospital Project
Construction of an expansive new veterans hospital in Aurora, Colo., restarted Monday, following the resolution of a contract dispute that had threatened to derail the project, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs said.
VA officials said they had reached an interim agreement, including a $157 million payment for costs owed by the department, with Kiewit-Turner, the company working to build the hospital. Earlier this month, Kiewit-Turner walked off the job after the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals in Washington found the VA had breached its contract with the builder.
Delays and cost overruns have long plagued the project, prompting VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson to travel to Aurora last week to apologize publicly to Colorado veterans.
Under the new agreement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will serve as advisers to the VA and help determine a long term plan to finish the hospital, which is about halfway completed.
"We appreciate the continued dialogue and collaboration with Deputy Secretary Gibson and the Corps of Engineers, as we all work together on this important project for Colorado-area Veterans," said Scott Cassels, executive vice president for Kiewit, in a statement.


Amid Tensions, Police Put Focus on Community Ties
Cities across the U.S. are struggling to redefine the relationship between police and their communities, as killings by white officers of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City have raised the stakes.
Police officials say they want to prevent widespread frustration over the shootings from escalating into violent protests nationwide or inspire copycats of the targeted killing of officers in New York City last weekend. Many departments are rededicating themselves to "community policing" efforts, such as developing partnerships with faith-based and neighborhood groups, offering training courses on bias, and putting officers on beats for years rather than months.
In Greensboro, N.C., a city of 280,000, about 20 officers marched through a troubled neighborhood last week, shaking hands with residents and talking about their jobs. They paused for prayer with local preachers near the site of an unsolved double homicide this year.
But critics of aggressive police tactics are unconvinced such efforts address the roots of the problem. The Rev. William Barber II, head of the North Carolina NAACP, said he appreciates Greensboro police reaching out, but that it isn't enough.
"Those changes are going to take more than having a prayer march," said Rev. Barber, who joined recent protests in North Carolina and Missouri against police violence. "What has to happen is not just a prayer march, but a prying open of the practices of how law enforcement engages the community."


Full Honors for Slain Officer's Funeral
About 25,000 police officers from across the country and untold numbers of civilians are expected to fill the streets around a Queens church for the funeral of Officer Rafael Ramos, authorities said.
Officer Ramos will be given an "inspector's funeral," which entails all of the traditions and pageantry that the New York Police Department brings to bear for an honored member who died in the line of duty.
Inside Christ Tabernacle Church, the officer's family and friends will attend with Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton and other dignitaries. Others allowed inside the 740-person capacity church will include members of the 84th precinct, where Officer Ramos was assigned with Officer Wenjian Liu.
The officers were ambushed in their patrol car last Saturday in Brooklyn by a gunman who later took his own life.
Outside the church, more than 20 square blocks in the middle of the low-slung, middle-class Queens community of Glendale will be closed off to traffic.


NYC Mayor to Meet Police Union Officials
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who faced boos and heckling at a New York Police Department graduation ceremony Monday, is slated to meet police union officials Tuesday in an effort to defuse hostilities.
The mayor is scheduled to meet leaders of the Captains Endowment Association, Lieutenants Benevolent Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, Detectives' Endowment Association and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. Police Commissioner William Bratton and senior NYPD leadership are also expected to attend.
An aide to the mayor said officials at City Hall, along with department officials, reached out to the union leaders to set up the meeting after Mr. de Blasio last week set in motion plans to meet the labor leaders.
On Monday, Mr. de Blasio praised the 884 graduates assembled for the ceremony at Madison Square Garden for choosing what he described as a "noble calling," telling the newly minted police officers they will "stare down the danger" and "keep the peace."
"You serve the people of the greatest city in the world. You serve in the greatest and finest police department on this Earth," Mr. de Blasio said. "It takes a special kind of person to put their lives on the line for others."


Greece's Bad Political Choices
Just when you thought it was safe to invest in Greece again, Greek politicians intervene. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's failure Monday to secure 180 out of 300 parliamentary votes for his preferred presidential candidate has triggered a national election, to be held Jan. 25. The stock market tumbled, and yields on Greek bonds rose, in a familiar vote of no confidence.
The greatest fear is that the far-left Syriza party will win enough seats to form a government. Syriza and its leader, Alexis Tsipras, oppose the bailout Greece has received from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank and have threatened to force a renegotiation that would require foreign creditors to take bigger haircuts on Greek debt. The party also promises free electricity, more spending and a rollback of even the small economic reforms that Greece has made.
Yet the closer the election comes, the warier voters become of Syriza. Its lead over Mr. Samaras's New Democracy party is now between three and four percentage points, down from 6.5 points in October, and it's not certain that Syriza could form a stable government even if it wins a majority. In this sense, Mr. Samaras's tactic of engineering an early election to focus voters on his opponents' shortcomings may be working.
The bigger problem for Greeks and foreigners is that Mr. Samaras lacks a growth strategy beyond the status quo of austerity and grinding debt. He opposed many elements of the bailout before he became prime minister in 2012, and his tenure has seen scant progress on such measures as opening professions to greater competition or reducing regulation on business. He's not presenting a serious reform agenda now.
Mr. Samaras is the candidate for responsible stagnation versus the reckless collapse Syriza would bring. Some choice. Voters could call Mr. Samaras's bluff and elect Syriza as a protest. If instead Syriza fares poorly, that political threat would be neutralized. But others could surface against Mr. Samaras, who won't have built a popular mandate for serious reform.

Assad Visits Front Line, as death toll mounts
President Bashar al-Assad made a rare visit to the front line of his country's civil war, spending New Year's Eve with his troops in a tense neighborhood in eastern Damascus, state media said Thursday.
State TV footage showed Mr. Assad having dinner of baked beans and boiled potatoes with soldiers and pro-government militiamen Wednesday night in the Jobar neighborhood, the site of intense fighting in recent months between troops and opposition fighters. Mr. Assad was last seen in public on April 20.
Meanwhile, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Thursday said more than 76,000 people were killed in 2014, including about 17,800 civilians. The monitoring group, which has a network of activists around the country, said the dead included some 22,600 troops and pro-government fighters.

Netanyahu Wins Backing Of Hard-line Likud Party
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the backing of his hard-line Likud party in its primary and will lead it into general elections this March, Israeli media reported on Thursday.


West Bank Attack Targets Americans
TEL AVIV—A group of Israeli settlers pelted a U.S. consulate security vehicle with rocks near a West Bank settlement during a visit Friday to investigate allegations that olive trees belonging to Palestinians had been uprooted, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.
The confrontation between U.S. guards and armed settlers—the first of its kind in recent memory—didn't result in any injuries.
A consulate spokesman said the U.S. is "deeply concerned" by the incident, and that the U.S. is offering video footage to aid in the Israeli investigation.
Photographs provided by a Palestinian escort showed the black U.S. consulate vehicle, a Chevrolet Suburban, with a dent on the hood and scarred on the side from the melee.
Fallout from the incident could aggravate already strained ties between the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who have quarreled over the last five years over settlements and negotiations with Iran.


Iowans Slow to Embrace Clinton
Interviews with more than half of Democratic chiefs in Iowa's 99 counties show a state party leadership so far reluctant to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. County Democratic officials also voiced qualms about Mrs. Clinton's ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations, which remain a target of liberal ire.
Many county officials said they would like to see senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race, though they were split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Mrs. Clinton.
"My heart wouldn't be in it for Hillary to the extent that it might be if it was a different candidate," said Jennifer Herrington, chair of the Page County Democrats in southwest Iowa. "I admire Hillary, she'd be a great president, but you know, she isn't my first choice I guess."
Of course, candidates can secure a party nomination without winning Iowa, an idiosyncratic contest that tends to reward candidates with strong local organization and passionate supporters. But as the first-in-the-nation contest, set to take place about a year from now, Iowa draws outsize attention from candidates and the media, and it can set a narrative for a party's entire primary season.


#BokoHaramIsWinning
Radical Islam has had its best year since 2001, and 2015 should be the year the U.S. leads a global counterattack. But you sure can't detect any progress from events in Nigeria, where the jihadists of Boko Haram are extending their violent reach while cooperation between the U.S. and Nigeria disintegrates.
On the weekend the militant group seized Baga in northeastern Nigeria, the last town in the area that was still under government control. Baga hosted the Multi-National Joint Task Force, which is composed of troops from Nigeria, Chad and Niger who are supposed to fight crime in the Lake Chad region. The task force inevitably confronted Boko Haram, and its rout shows that the jihadists are confident and strong enough to take on even an organized military force.
Boko Haram attacks towns and villages on a daily basis. Their specialty is mass kidnapping—of boys and young men to join their ranks, and of girls to become wives of its warriors. CNN reports that the group abducted 40 hostages on the weekend from the village of Malari, also in the northeast.
Boko Haram—which means "Western education is forbidden" in the Hausa language—is the group that kidnapped more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls to great global consternation last year. The kidnapping prompted Michelle Obama to pose for a photo holding the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. The Twitter offensive made Westerners feel good but it didn't impress Boko Haram.


Black Boxes Likely Fell Out of AirAsia Tail: Official
The black-box data recorders of AirAsia Flight 8501 probably separated from the plane's tail upon impact with water, an Indonesian official suggested Friday, as recovery teams worked to prepare that rear section of the wreckage for retrieval from the bottom of the Java Sea. (Update: AirAsia Flight 8501's Tail Recovered)
Based on pings detected Friday morning about a half-mile southwest of the wreckage, the black boxes could be outside remnants of the tail, where they are normally housed, said Suyadi Bambang Supriyadi, director of operations of Indonesia's search-and-rescue agency. Underwater monitoring equipment detected pings in that area, but divers were unable to locate the black boxes, another official said.
Meanwhile, air-safety experts said the condition of some victims' bodies suggested the plane didn't come apart in midair, and may have hit the water at a relatively shallow angle.
Despite high waves and strong currents, divers succeeded in fastening inflatable bags to the tail piece, which they plan to use to help raise the section to the surface. But the operation was waiting for a crane as early as Saturday to assist in lifting the wreckage from the water.
The tail section of the AirAsia jet is resting at a depth of about 100 feet and appears to have landed upside down. The Airbus A320 crashed on Dec. 28 en route to Singapore from Surabaya with 162 people on board.


Warren Doesn't Get Her Man
Elizabeth Warren bagged her first big political pelt on the weekend, as Antonio Weiss withdrew his nomination to be the number three man at the Treasury Department, running domestic finance. Or did she?
The Massachusetts Senator rallied the left against the longtime Lazard executive and Obama campaign bundler on grounds that the Democratic Party is too beholden to Wall Street. This is amusing considering that Jack Lew, the top man at Treasury, presided over mortgage disasters at Citigroup when it received the biggest bailout of any major bank. Maybe the Warren Standard is that only failed Wall Street executives can work in a Democratic Treasury.
But even here her victory is something of a mirage. Mr. Weiss wrote a letter to President Obama asking that his nomination be withdrawn so it wouldn't be a "distraction" to the White House. But he is also still heading to Treasury as a "counselor" to Mr. Lew on just about everything.
Mr. Weiss will "provide advice to me on a broad range of domestic and international issues, including financial markets, regulatory reform, job creation, and fostering broad-based economic growth," Mr. Lew said. "It is a testament to Antonio's character and commitment to public service that he is willing to serve his country in this capacity."


French Jews Face Hate They Left Africa to Escape
The Hyper Cacher attack, one of the deadliest against France's Jewish community since World War II, spurred outrage across the country. It was by no means isolated, coming against a backdrop of acts of violence and intimidation.
"It is going from bad to worse in France, and we know that it is not going to stop," said Ms. Bettach, 33 years old. "I can't sleep at night anymore. All day when my kids are at school, I worry. I just don't see any future for my children in this country."


Trial Lawyers as War Profiteers
The Supreme Court spends much of its time these days policing creative theories that will enrich lawyers but distort the law. On Tuesday the Justices heard a case that would allow lawyers nearly unlimited time to file civil fraud claims by using an expansive definition of war.
Enter the plaintiffs bar, which came up with the idea to waive the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits too. The increasingly liberal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals bought this legal invention, and on Tuesday the Supreme Court heard the appeal.
That's only half the madness. In 2008 Congress amended the World War II waiver law to define war as any military action authorized by Congress, so under the new interpretation the statute of limitations would essentially vanish. The war in Afghanistan is now in its second decade and the war on terror will last for decades.


Oklahoma Carries Out First Execution Since April's Botched Lethal Injection
Oklahoma executed its first convict Thursday since a botched execution last year, shortly after a divided Supreme Court refused to block the procedure.
Charles Warner, convicted of the rape and murder of an 11-month old girl, died at 7:28 p.m., about an hour after the court notified prison officials that they could proceed, said Terri Watkins, a state corrections-department spokeswoman.
The execution, at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, took 17 minutes, Ms. Watkins said. "No complications," she said in an email.
"Before I give my final statement, I'll tell you they poked me five times. It hurt. It feels like acid," the Associated Press reported Mr. Warner saying before the execution began. "I'm not a monster," he added. "I didn't do everything they said I did."
After he was given the first drug, Mr. Warner said, "My body is on fire," but he showed no obvious signs of distress, AP reported.

Complaint Against Kirchner Released
BUENOS AIRES—A federal judge released the entire criminal complaint alleging Argentina's president and her associates conspired with Iran to sabotage a probe into a 1994 terrorist bombing here, detailing passages from intercepted phone calls and other evidence.
The 289-page complaint was compiled by Alberto Nisman, the prosecutor whose body was found a day before he was scheduled to present at a congressional hearing the report on the attack that killed 85 people at a Jewish center here.
The timing of Mr. Nisman's death has sparked protests and anger against Cristina Kirchner's government from Argentines.
On Sunday, Mr. Nisman's body was found in the bathroom of his 13th floor apartment in an upscale neighborhood here. He had suffered a gunshot to the head, and a .22-caliber handgun was found next to his body, according to an autopsy and the prosecutor investigating Mr. Nisman's death. The autopsy determined he fired the gun at himself at point-blank range.
On Wednesday, a locksmith who had been called in by the prosecutor investigating Mr. Nisman's death told reporters that the service door to his apartment had been easy to open. Meanwhile, local media reported that investigators had discovered a third entrance to Mr. Nisman's home—a tight passage connected to another apartment. Media reports said it contained fresh fingerprints and footprints.


Top Venezuelan Bodyguard Defects to U.S.
CARACAS, Venezuela—A former bodyguard to Diosdado Cabello, the powerful president of congress and a leader of Venezuela's military wing, defected to the U.S. to cooperate with officials investigating drug-trafficking, Venezuelan authorities said.
Leamsy Salazar, who had previously worked for late President Hugo Chávez's security detail, is currently in Washington, where he is expected to provide witness testimony implicating Mr. Cabello in organizing cocaine-smuggling operations controlled by Venezuela's military, two people familiar with the matter said.
Both people said the end goal is an indictment against Mr. Cabello on drug charges. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment, while officials at the State Department didn't respond to calls seeking comment.
Venezuelan officials on Tuesday lashed out at Mr. Salazar and the U.S., saying that the motive of Mr. Salazar's defection is to destabilize President Nicolás Maduro's government. This oil-rich country is plagued by a moribund economy expected to contract 7% this year, the world's highest inflation and widespread shortages of basic items—problems that have made Mr. Maduro highly unpopular, polls show.
Pedro Carreño, a former interior minister and member of the ruling Socialist Party, said in televised comments that Mr. Salazar had worked for Mr. Cabello. Flanked by other ruling party leaders in congress, Mr. Carreño said that Mr. Salazar "deserted in December from the armed forces and now he appears in the U.S. as a protected witness to defame, humiliate and try to submit the national assembly president to public derision."


After Islamic State Defeat, a City of Ruin
KOBANI, Syria—Kurdish commander Harun Kurdistan toured what was left of a neighborhood this weekend in a battered minivan, a Soviet-era sniper rifle propped on his seat, after his forces successfully ended a four-month battle to wrest control of this border town from Islamic State jihadists.
"The fighting was face to face, inside buildings. Us shooting from downstairs as they were upstairs," said Mr. Kurdistan, as he drove along the same thoroughfare used by militants to enter the town last year. "We only survived because we believed in our cause."
Victory seems to have come at the price of the town itself. Streets lie in ruins. Water and power systems are shattered. Decaying corpses of jihadist fighters remain, some stripped of footwear and clothing, and one still swaddled in a suicide vest. Thousands of people died, and another 200,000 remain refugees across the border in Turkey.
Four months ago, this little-known town caught the world's attention with televised images showing Islamic State fighters bombarding its streets and hoisting their black flag on a nearby hill.
Now, tricolor flags of red, green and yellow fly over the city after Kurdish fighters—backed by the air power of a U.S.-led coalition—dealt Islamic State a humiliating battlefield defeat.

Thailand's Dictators in Denial
The U.S. offered muted criticism of Thailand's military coup last May—no doubt because the country is designated a "major non-NATO ally" and the coup plotters promised to restore democracy quickly. But the junta's decision last month to abandon political reconciliation and impeach former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra for alleged corruption has prompted the Obama administration to speak up.
Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel, the most senior U.S. official to visit Thailand since last May's coup, used a speech at Thailand's most prestigious university last week to call for an end to martial law and restrictions on free speech and assembly. With classic diplomatic understatement he warned that "the international community is left with the impression that [the prosecution of Ms. Yingluck] could be politically driven." The U.S. has also scaled back the annual "Cobra Gold" joint military exercise.
The junta responded with outrage, while the pro-government media whipped up a frenzy of anti-American anger at this supposed interference in Thailand's internal affairs. If that accusation has a Chinese ring, it is no coincidence: Beijing has seized the opportunity to cozy up to the junta. Dictator Prayuth Chan-ocha visited Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping on Dec. 23. While the U.S. Embassy fields complaints and protests, Chinese companies sign contracts to build railways.
Meanwhile, on Sunday night two small improvised bombs exploded outside Bangkok's busiest shopping mall, injuring one person. Nobody claimed responsibility, but the incident is reminiscent of a 2010 episode in which largely peaceful antigovernment protests were disrupted by mysterious men firing military weapons. These so-called "black shirts" were never caught, and their activities provided a justification for the military to clear the streets at the cost of about 100 lives.
In December, a former Prime Minister and Army chief Chavalit Yongchaiyudh warned of the possibility that a faction of the military could attempt a counter-coup. That remains unlikely, but reports of political divisions within the Army have filtered out steadily since the last coup in 2006. That may have helped push the junta to become more hard-line.

HEALTH CARE
Studies Question Impact of Surgery Registry
Amid growing interest in rewarding "quality" health care, two new studies found that tracking and comparing hospitals' rates of surgical complications and deaths doesn't necessarily improve outcomes.
Hundreds of U.S. hospitals voluntarily report data on surgical complications, readmissions, length of stay and mortality to a registry run by the American College of Surgeons, one of the oldest and largest in the country. In return, they receive risk-adjusted data showing how they rank with other hospitals.
The surgeons' group says that each year a hospital participates in its National Surgical Quality Improvement Program "it has the opportunity to reduce the number of complications by 250 to 500 and save 12 to 36 lives." But two studies published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that such outcomes have improved in hospitals generally in recent years, whether or not they participated in the NSQIP registry.
Researchers from the University of Michigan studied Medicare claims for 1.2 million patients undergoing surgery at 263 participating hospitals and 526 nonparticipating hospitals from 2003 to 2013. There were no significant differences in adjusted 30-day mortality, serious complications, re-operations or readmissions. There also were no difference in average Medicare payments during the three years.


Murder Mystery Begins in Queens
William Klinger, a history professor specializing in Yugoslavian leader Tito, arrived in New York from Rome in late January, meeting up with a fellow Croatian national with a similar penchant for European history.
Days later, Mr. Klinger, 42 years old, was found face down in the snow in Astoria Park in Queens with two bullet wounds to the head, New York City police said.
The friend Mr. Klinger was staying with, Alexander Bonich, a self-described author and translator who police said confessed to the killing, was arraigned Tuesday on murder charges. He was ordered held without bail.
Police are still working to find a motive, but the men met about a year ago at a bookstore, and appeared to have an argument involving a real estate deal, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said.
The details of exactly what happened are murky.


Silk Road Creator Found Guilty of Cybercrimes
A federal jury Wednesday found Ross Ulbricht guilty of seven felony charges in connection with running Silk Road, an online drug bazaar described by prosecutors as the most sophisticated criminal marketplace on the Internet.
The verdict marks a victory for the government as federal prosecutors around the country take increasingly more aggressive steps to clamp down on the shadowy world of cybercrime.
After 31⁄2 hours of deliberation, an anonymous jury of six men and six women found the 30-year-old California man guilty of creating and operating a website that started out selling homegrown psychedelic mushrooms and swelled into a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise. Prosecutors say Silk Road offered illegal goods such as cocaine, fake driver's licenses and computer-hacking tools to thousands of buyers.
Mr. Ulbricht, who has been in custody since his arrest in October 2013, faces a possible life sentence after the jury convicted him of each count in the case, including conspiring to sell drugs, launder money and hack computers. His sentencing is scheduled for May 15.
Joshua Dratel, Mr. Ulbricht's lawyer, described the verdict as "very disappointing" and said he is confident that Mr. Ulbricht would prevail on appeal. Mr. Dratel said the judge wrongly denied the jurors access to much of the defense's evidence and witnesses, providing ample ground for an appeal.


The View from NATO's Russian Front
Wiesbaden, Germany
'I believe the Russians are mobilizing right now for a war that they think is going to happen in five or six years—not that they're going to start a war in five or six years, but I think they are anticipating that things are going to happen, and that they will be in a war of some sort, of some scale, with somebody within the next five or six years."
The U.S. military presence in Europe is more vital at this moment than it has been in many years. American engagement is essential if the West is to deter a revanchist Russia that has set out to "redraw the boundaries of Europe," Gen. Hodges says with a native Floridian's drawl.


Nigeria to Delay Election by 6 Weeks
Nigeria postponed its Feb. 14 election to give its army six weeks to quell Boko Haram, defying pressure from both the opposition and the U.S. to hold the landmark vote on time.
After days of back-and-forth arguing over the date of the poll, Nigeria's security chiefs—all appointed by President Goodluck Jonathan—said on Saturday they couldn't guarantee the safety of election workers or voters in next week's vote.
"Under such circumstances we believe that few election bodies across the world, if any, would contemplate proceeding with the election as scheduled," Attahiru Jega, chairman of Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission told reporters.
Nigeria's government has had nearly six years to contain Boko Haram, five of them under Mr. Jonathan's watch. The Islamic insurgency was still fighting with swords and grenades made from soda cans when he took office in 2010, on the death of his predecessor Umaru Musa Yar'Adua.
Now Boko Haram wields tanks, armored cars, mortars, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, antiaircraft guns and a seemingly endless supply of ammunition—all stolen from the armories of Nigeria. Its war on the government has left just shy of 19,000 people dead in the last four years, more than half of those in the past 12 months alone, according to New York's Council on Foreign Relations.


Australia's Abbott Brings Leadership Fight Forward
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has rescheduled for Monday a vote challenging his leadership, in a bid to cut short an uprising among conservative lawmakers scrambling to head off a likely defeat at elections next year.
Facing intensifying speculation he might be replaced by one of his ministers, Mr. Abbott said his ruling party lawmakers will meet in Canberra at 9 a.m. to decide whether to open his position to challenge. The vote on the so-called spill motion brought by backbench lawmaker Luke Simpkins had been scheduled for Tuesday.
"The last thing Australia needs right now is instability and uncertainty. On reflection and after talking to my colleagues, I have decided that the best thing we can do is deal with the spill motion as quickly as possible and put it behind us," Mr. Abbott said Sunday in a short statement to the media.
Mr. Abbott's popularity has fallen sharply since his first budget, unveiled in May, cut into spending for health and education, in addition to pensions for older Australians—cuts that Mr. Abbott pledged in opposition not to pursue. His 16-month leadership has also been clouded by controversies, such his decision to honor Britain's Prince Philip with a knighthood.
Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop are considered the most likely candidates to replace Mr. Abbott if he is pushed out, although neither has publicly expressed interest in taking over the job.

Three Parents, One Baby? Not at All
Last week the British House of Commons voted to allow research on a scientific technique that, if successful, could lead to babies born with DNA from three adults. The decision has to be approved by the House of Lords. It should be, and the United States should follow suit. Here's why.
Every year hundreds of people in the U.S., including children, suffer horrific disease and death due to inherited mutations in tiny entities in our cells called mitochondria. These tiny bodies break down nutrients we eat to make energy for our cells.
Scientists have been working to develop a way to replace a mother's mutated mitochondria with healthy mitochondria, allowing the parents to have children who are healthy and survive. The children would have more than 99.99% of their DNA from their two parents and an infinitesimal fraction—less than 0.01%—from the woman who provided the healthy mitochondria. The procedure, called mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), could help hundreds of parents in the U.S., and thousands around the world.


Ex-Wife Testifies in Trial of Man Accused of Etan Patz Murder
The ex-wife of the man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 testified Monday that she found a piece of a missing-child poster among her husband's possessions several years after he told her he strangled someone in New York.
Daisy Rivera of Camden, N.J., told jurors in state Supreme Court in Manhattan that she made the discovery in the early 1980s while she and her then-husband, Pedro Hernandez, were living with her parents.
Ms. Rivera said she sought an explanation, thinking he may have had a child he never told her about. "I confronted him with it," she said. "He became nervous."
Mr. Hernandez told her the child in the photo had gone missing, she testified, and he kept the photo because he knew the family from his time working at a SoHo bodega.
Mr. Hernandez, 54 years old, is accused of kidnapping and murdering Etan, last seen on May 25, 1979, as he walked toward the school bus stop outside that bodega.


50 Indicted in Bribery Schemes Involving NYC Employees
In New York City's fast-paced real-estate world, an envelope full of cash or a free Caribbean cruise was sufficient to clear even serious building violations from scores of properties, according to a series of indictments detailed Tuesday.
Fifty people, including 16 city employees and 31 people representing developers and building owners, were charged in alleged schemes that paid bribes totaling $450,000, prosecutors said.
The indictments were announced by the Manhattan district attorney's office, the city Department of Investigation and the New York Police Department.
As part of the alleged schemes, complaints were dismissed and building stop-work orders for problems like "failure to safe guard persons and property" were removed, prosecutors said. Housing violations for rodents, blocked fire escapes, lack of adequate heat and mold were cleared—without inspection.
The highest ranking official indicted was Donald O'Connor, 44 years old, chief of development for Manhattan construction at the city Department of Buildings. He was charged with accepting bribes to expedite inspections and dismiss complaints.


Greece Demands War Reparations
BERLIN—Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought to send Berlin a message this week by demanding that Germany pay Athens billions of euros in World War II-related reparations and unpaid debt.
Greece, Mr. Tsipras said in his inaugural address in parliament, has "a moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism" to pursue the reparations. The country was ravaged during the Germans' four-year occupation, a history that remains fresh despite the passage of time.
The leftist prime minister's move to confront Germany with what most Greeks see as Berlin's outstanding debt to Athens is a theme that has played out repeatedly in his first days in power, as the new government has tried to use a mix of economic argument and moral suasion to win leniency from its creditors.
Immediately after his swearing-in as prime minister in late January, Mr. Tsipras visited a site where Nazi occupation forces had executed resistance fighters outside Athens.


Green Love Is Blind
The fall of long-time Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber will go down in some quarters as a case of blind love. But it's better understood as modern green influence-peddling.
Mr. Kitzhaber resigned Friday, only months after winning a fourth term despite a lackluster economy and the failure of the state ObamaCare exchange that spent $200 million signing up no one. Voters also overlooked the ethics of his fiancée and live-in political adviser Cylvia Hayes. She had a previously undisclosed marriage to an Ethiopian immigrant that was a fraud to get him a green card. Mr. Kitzhaber called this a "personal issue," and enough voters agreed.
The Portland Tribune reported in January that Ms. Hayes had received a $40,000 contract from the Energy Foundation to develop an environmental communications strategy. The Energy Foundation is partly funded by green billionaire Tom Steyer's charitable trust. Media outlets released emails last week that showed Ms. Hayes pushed for Oregon to implement a program from a policy group that had previously paid her $25,000.


Libya Pipeline Explosion Called Sabotage
Libyan oil officials have blamed saboteurs for blowing up a pipeline and stopping flows from the country's largest oil field.
The fire from the Saturday explosion was extinguished on Sunday, the state-owned National Oil Co. said. The blast affected the pipeline from Sarir, until now the country's highest-producing oil field at 185,000 barrels a day, said the company on its website over the weekend.
The blast came after gunmen assaulted a U.S.-Libyan oil field Friday and less than two weeks after gunmen claiming to represent Islamic State killed nine guards and kidnapped at least three workers at a nearby Libyan-French facility.
The field attacked on Saturday is operated by an NOC subsidiary.
Libya's production level fell to about 325,000 barrels a day in January from almost 900,000 barrels in October. Production has been dented by an armed conflict between two rival governments and now oil officials fear foreign terrorist groups are eyeing the country's resources.


FAA Floats Rules for Commercial Drones
Federal regulators proposed long-awaited rules for commercial drones in the U.S., a landmark in the nation's aviation policy that is expected to lead to a new era in which unmanned aircraft become common.
The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a policy that would replace the current near-ban on flying drones for commercial purposes with a simple approval process for operators governing commercial flight of any drone up to 55 pounds. Operators would be required only to pass a written exam on FAA rules to obtain a certificate from the agency for drone flying, and to comply with certain safety requirements. The test must be passed again every two years.
Those safety requirements would limit commercial drone flights to below 500 feet, during daytime hours and within sight of the operator. Notably, the proposed rule would also ban flying commercial drones near airports or over people not involved in the drone's flight.
The proposed rules would "provide probably the most flexible regime for unmanned aircraft 55 pounds or less that exists anywhere in the world," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said on a conference call to announce the rules on Sunday.
The proposed rules, which are about four years behind schedule, are now open for a 60-day period of public commentary, which the FAA will take into account before publishing the final regulations—likely next year. The rules don't affect recreational use of drones, which is already permitted as long as users obey safe-operating requirements.


Police Cancel Parade in Germany Over Terror Threat
BERLIN—Police in the northern German city of Braunschweig banned Sunday's Carnival parade following threats with an "Islamic background," the police said in a statement, just hours after shootings in Denmark.
The parade is the largest of its kind in northern Germany attracting around 250,000 visitors each year and usually takes place the weekend before Lent. It was due to start midday and was canceled about 90 minutes before the scheduled start. Police asked all visitors to keep away from the parade's planned route and not to travel to Braunschweig.
"Reliable state security sources hinted at a concrete threat for an attack with Islamic background," the police statement said.
The city's mayor, Ulrich Markurth, told German broadcaster NDR that the police received hints that had to be taken "very, very seriously."
Various Carnival parades are scheduled to take place in Germany through Tuesday. The western German city of Cologne for example is hosting Europe's largest street festival on Rose Monday, which usually draws a crowd of more than one million people.


How to Usher in Lent? Try Exploding Hammers
SAN JUAN DE LA VEGA, MEXICO—Brazilians celebrate the day before Lent with dancing samba in skimpy outfits. In New Orleans, revelers throw beads at Mardi Gras. In this dusty central Mexican town, they have a different kind of a blast.
Call it the Feast of the Exploding Hammers.
Even amid the inexhaustible tally of quirky rituals that communities anywhere hold dear, the Fat Tuesday frenzy in San Juan de la Vega elicits awe.
Hundreds of boys and young men gathered again here on Tuesday to affix fist-sized balls of homemade explosives, containing a mixture of potassium chlorate (used in matches and fireworks) and sulfur, to the heads of sledge hammers. They then slammed the rigged tools on iron rails and rocks.
The result: Deafening, smoky and potentially fatal blasts. By noon, about a dozen people were slightly injured.

Data released Thursday, the last quarterly set of data to come out before the election, showed donations to the Scottish National Party in 2014 rose to £4.1 million ($6.3 million), 10 times the 2013 total. The U.K. Independence Party, which is pushing for the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, received £3.8 million last year, more than five times the 2013 amount.
Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party and the main opposition Labour Party saw increases in donations during the last quarter and in 2014 compared with the previous year.

Death Toll Climbs In River Ferry Disaster
At least 70 people died when a river ferry capsized after colliding with a cargo vessel in central Bangladesh, officials said.
Rescuers recovered 48 bodies on Sunday and an additional 22 on Monday, according to police. The ferry was carrying as many as 140 passengers and crew.
The ferry, the M.L. Mosta, capsized and sank in 20 feet of water in the Padma River on Sunday after being struck by the cargo vessel.
Zihad Mia, the official overseeing the rescue operation, said it wasn't known how many passengers were missing and how many had survived. The search for more bodies was called off Monday after a salvage ship pulled the ferry to the surface and towed it to shore.


Maine Digs In to Review Mining Rules
Maine lawmakers are set to debate redrawn mining regulations sought by a Canadian conglomerate that owns vast swaths of timberland and wants to pull gold, copper and other metals from a remote mountainside.
The debate pits New Brunswick-based J.D. Irving Ltd. and others against environmentalists over the future of Bald Mountain in northern Maine's Aroostook County. Metal deposits were first discovered there in 1977 but remain untapped.
Closely held Irving, the state's largest landowner, was the main driver behind a 2012 law that directed state regulators to replace 1991 mining rules, lawmakers say. The law's proponents, including Republican Gov. Paul LePage, blame the regulations for stymieing mining development.
But the Legislature has the power to approve the regulatory changes and shot them down last year after both chambers shifted from Republican to Democratic control. This set the table for another go-around, which begins with a public hearing set for Wednesday. The legislature is now split between a Republican Senate and a Democratic House.
Irving declined to answer questions about its involvement but said it looks forward to the public debate. "We have been doing business in Maine for over 65 years, and our commitment is to responsible operations in the state," spokeswoman Mary Keith said. "We believe that responsible mining can provide for vital job creation in northern Maine."


Minimum-Wage Boost for Tipped Employees
New York's wage board overhauled the state's tipping laws and will study whether the practice should be eliminated altogether, according to a decision issued Tuesday by acting Commissioner of Labor Mario J. Musolino.
The new rules raise the minimum tipped wage to $7.50 per hour across the state, as of Dec. 31. If New York City raises its minimum wage, its rate would increase by an additional dollar.
Rates currently range from $4.90 to $5.65 across the state.
The decision drew anger from restaurant industry officials, who called the increase extreme and unprecedented.
"It's troubling," said Melissa Fleischut, president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association.

Shooter Kills 8, Then Himself, at Restaurant
A gunman opened fire in a small-town restaurant filled with lunchtime diners, killing eight people before fatally shooting himself.
The shooting in Uhersky Brod, a town of about 17,000 some 180 miles southeast of the capital Prague, wasn't believed to be an act of terrorism. The mayor, Patrik Kuncar, described the assailant as a local man in his 60s who may have suffered from mental illness.
Shootings are rare in the Czech Republic, where there are strict limits and controls on possession of firearms. The gunman fired around 25 shots into the Druzba restaurant, officials said. There were about 20 people in the restaurant, witnesses said.
"I, like the majority of citizens, am shocked by this tragic attack. I would like to express my deep sorrow and condolences to the families and relatives of the victims," Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said.


Judge in Batista Trial Removed
SÃO PAULO—A court in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday removed the judge presiding over the criminal trial of businessman Eike Batista for allegedly driving a Porsche Cayenne he ordered seized from the former billionaire, according to a spokesman at the federal appeals court.
Earlier this week, the same federal appeals court opened a probe into the judge's conduct after local media published photos of a man identified as Federal Judge Flávio Roberto de Souza driving the vehicle around the beachside city. Federal police seized the vehicle and other personal assets from Mr. Batista earlier this month as guarantees to repay investors in the event the entrepreneur is found guilty of insider trading.
Judge de Souza couldn't be reached for comment Thursday.
The removal will likely delay the trail as a new judge will have to be assigned to the case.
Sergio Bermudes, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Batista, called Judge de Souza's removal "magnificent." The attorney also called the judge's alleged behavior "absurd."


Welcome to the Obamanet
The Federal Communications Commission's decision Thursday to regulate the Internet as a public utility is a depressing moment for American innovation and economic liberty. The FCC is grabbing political control over a vibrant market that until now has been driven by inventors and consumers. Welcome to the Obamanet.
President Obama demanded this result in a November speech, and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Democrats Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel have now dutifully voted to apply last century's monopoly telephone rules to Internet service providers. They have in the process made a mockery of the agency's supposed independence.
The rules are ostensibly to prevent Internet companies from blocking customer access to particular websites or slowing down service. But the FCC has presented no evidence that this is occurring, so the power grab is being justified by some theoretical future harm.
By the way, the FCC hasn't released the text it has now approved as a final rule, which according to dissenting Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai runs to more than 300 pages. It's not clear when the public will be permitted to see what Washington has done, and the normal comment period has been bypassed on a plan that is vastly different than what Mr. Wheeler has previously proposed.
Meantime, Mr. Wheeler will exercise what FCC lawyers call "editorial privileges," allowing him to craft his arguments after reading the two dissents. Taxpayers might prefer that regulators analyze the pros and cons before voting to impose something on the whole country, and we hope judges feel the same way when the rules are challenged in court.


A Misbegotten Shutdown Showdown on Immigration
Leave it to Republicans to do the right thing after exhausting all other options.
Speaker John Boehner announced Tuesday that the House would vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, even though some members of his caucus thought Republicans could withhold funding to protest President Obama's immigration policies and not pay a price politically. They were kidding themselves. Republicans may control both chambers of Congress, but their political opponents still control the news media.
The DHS drama has played out just as President Obama hoped it would when he moved unilaterally in November to protect some five million illegal immigrants from deportation. He knew that Republicans would turn on one another, that his liberal friends in the Fourth Estate would play up the party division and that the GOP would be cast as anti-immigrant villains. The same conservatives who like to mock the president's intelligence are making him look like a genius.
A group of about 50 Republicans in the House insisted that a showdown over DHS funding would be a political winner for the party. But they never had the votes in the Senate to force Mr. Obama's hand, and nothing in his history as president suggests that he would otherwise reverse course. Whether the issue is net neutrality, Common Core education standards or cutting a nuclear deal with Iran, this is a White House that has had little use for the legislative branch. Even when Mr. Obama has deigned to go through Congress, as he did with ObamaCare, he later selectively enforces his own laws.
Republican lawmakers are understandably frustrated at Mr. Obama's immigration end-run, but as Mr. Boehner told his caucus this week, the place to push back is the courtroom, where a federal judge has stayed the order. "The good news is that the president's executive action has been stopped, for now," said the speaker in a closed-door meeting, according to Politico. "This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight."


New York City to Add Two Muslim Holidays to School Calendar
Members of the Muslim community greeted Mayor Bill de Blasio with handshakes and kisses Wednesday as he sauntered through a Brooklyn school gymnasium to announce that New York City public schools will begin observing two sacred Muslim holidays this fall.
Mr. de Blasio wooed the city's Muslim community when he successfully ran for mayor in 2013, promising he would add Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr to the official list of holidays on which the schools close.
Some Muslim leaders on Wednesday explicitly said they would pay the mayor back in 2017, when he is expected to run for re-election.
"You kept your promise to our community, and we'll keep our promise to you," said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, at Wednesday morning's news conference.
Ms. Sarsour said she intended that remark as a political statement about Mr. de Blasio's presumed re-election bid.


Hillary's Email Escapade
Hillary Clinton has made some disingenuous statements over her political career, but none remotely compare to the tweet she issued Wednesday night: "I want the public to see my email," she said. This requires—how to say it—a willing suspension of disbelief.
Mrs. Clinton was referring to the gracious permission she had just bestowed upon the State Department to release her email correspondence as the nation's former top diplomat. She's only in a position to grant such favors because it turns out all of her correspondence as Secretary of State was conducted on private email, run out of a server she alone controlled. The Clinton camp has spent this week explaining that none of this was untoward, that no laws were broken, and that she's being transparent.
Were you just awakening from a 40-year coma and still a bit fuzzy, this might strike you as remotely plausible. For everyone else who has lived through the Bill and Hill years, this email caper is pure Clinton.
First, historical context. There are few politicians alive today who have a better understanding than the Clintons of the perils of paper trails—and the benefits of not having them. It really wasn't all that long ago that Mrs. Clinton was failing to answer questions about how her Rose Law firm billing records vanished. Or using executive privilege to sit on documents that showed her involvement in the Travel Office firings. Or grappling with testimony from a Secret Service agent who said Mrs. Clinton's top aide had removed files from Vince Foster's office. Or explaining her connection to Sandy Berger, who was prosecuted for stealing Clinton-related National Archives records.
If you don't think all this wasn't informing Mrs. Clinton's decision—on the day of her first confirmation hearing—to register clintonemail.com, you aren't thinking.


The Allure of the Islamic State Vandals
On Thursday the Islamic State assault on Iraq's cultural heritage continued, with jihadists using trucks to wreck large statues in the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, according to government officials. The rampage followed the recent release of a propaganda video showing the destruction of priceless artifacts in the Mosul Museum. In the video, one of the jihadists takes a sledgehammer to an ancient Mesopotamian statue. Another applies a power drill to the face of a winged man-bull of Nineveh. Three thousand years of history smashed, while the perpetrators celebrate with a mix of smug piety and aggressive malice.
I am a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, and my first reaction to news of this cultural vandalism was a sense of personal loss. These artifacts didn't belong only to the people of today's Iraq. They belonged to anyone who has ever spent a childhood reading "The How & Why Wonder Book of Lost Cities" or visited the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute and gazed up into the blank stone eyes of its bearded animal-human genii (cousins of the gate-guardians that shattered on the Mosul Museum floor).
In the video, the destruction—repulsive to watch—is accompanied by the haunting, elegant sound of a jihadist chanting from the Quran. As a longtime student of Islamic culture, I know that such recitation is a demanding discipline, requiring finely timed breath control and mastery of the intricacies of seventh-century pronunciation and grammar. The fusha ("eloquent Arabic") of Islamic scripture is revered by Muslims as a language nobler and purer than any Arabic dialect spoken today.
Listening to good Quran chanting (and the chanter on this video was very good indeed) is a pleasure akin to hearing a fine performance of Shakespeare—Patrick Stewart, say, reciting Prospero's lines in "The Tempest."
Let me be clear: I'm a Christian, a Catholic. If I shut my eyes to the malicious violence being perpetrated in the video and just listen to the Arabic recital, I can conjure the pleasure of attending the Easter Vigil service (I was an altar boy once, when the mass was still said in Latin) while the priest sang the "Exultet" and lighted the Paschal candle.


Mexico Official: 14 Police Face Charges of Kidnapping, Extortion
CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico--Mexican troops have detained 15 federal police officers on charges of kidnapping the owner of a construction company in the northern border city of Matamoros and demanding a $2 million (31 million peso) ransom, a government official said Saturday.
The official with the federal Attorney General's Office said the officers were arrested late Thursday as they prepared to receive the money they had demanded for earlier releasing the businessman.
The official, who agreed to reveal details of the case only if not quoted by name because he wasn't authorized to talk with journalists, said the family had alerted the military to the kidnapping and ransom demand. Soldiers and marines then mounted an operation that led to the arrest, he said.
The federal police officers face charges of kidnapping and extortion, the official said.
The officers are part of a group sent this year to bolster a security operation in Matamoros, which is across from Brownsville, Texas.


Police Trace, Arrest Laser Suspect
The reports Monday evening began like many others to the Federal Aviation Administration in recent years.
The FAA said it received four reports from commercial pilots landing or taking off at La Guardia Airport of lasers pointed in their direction. Two came at 7:05 p.m., another a minute later and a fourth at 7:52 p.m. Lasers beamed at aircraft can cause temporary blindness in pilots.
Alerted by the FAA, a helicopter in the New York Police Department's aviation unit responded.
Federal officials say the number of laser incidents in the U.S. involving aircraft jumped from 311 in 2005 to 3,894 in 2014. In the New York area, the number of reported laser incidents increased from 52 in 2010 to 71 in 2014, according to the FBI's New York field office.
Most of the time, those pointing lasers get away. But not this time, according to authorities.


Sierra Leone Vice President Seeks Asylum
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone—Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana said on Saturday that he asked for asylum in the U.S. after soldiers here disarmed the security team at his residence.
"I don't feel safe this morning as vice president," Mr. Sam-Sumana, who was expelled from the ruling party last week, told the Associated Press by phone. He said he wasn't at his residence and declined to disclose his whereabouts.
After hearing that soldiers were heading to his home Saturday morning, Mr. Sam-Sumana said he tried and failed to contact President Ernest Bai Koroma. Instead, he said he reached the presidential guard, which informed him his security team was being disarmed on orders from the president.
Mr. Sam-Sumana said he then called U.S. Ambassador John Hoover and requested asylum. "They're having a meeting and they will get back to me," the vice president said.
U.S. embassy spokeswoman Hollyn Green said that embassy officials, including Mr. Hoover, were aware of the situation. "There is no comment at the moment and there is no action on our part," Ms. Green said.


It's Time for Grown-Ups to Get Their Shots
A new push is on to get more adults vaccinated against devastating diseases like pneumonia, shingles and whooping cough.
Public-health officials and infectious-disease experts are working with physicians, health plans and drugstore chains to better educate adults about what shots they need—and make sure they follow up. State health departments are expanding the use of registries to better document patient vaccine records, and using strategies such as "standing orders" that authorize nurses and pharmacists to administer recommended vaccines without a doctor's exam or prescription.
Behind the effort is rising concern about the immunization status of the aging baby-boom population. While there has been more progress with geriatric patients, just over 45% of adults 50-64 were vaccinated against influenza in the 2012-13 seasons. And for six important nonflu vaccines, adult rates "are dismally low," says David Kim, deputy associate director for adult immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Collectively as a health-care system, we need to get the word out to health-care providers to talk about vaccines with their adult patients," Dr. Kim says.
Double threat
With the recent focus on the dangers of failing to vaccinate children, experts say, unvaccinated adults may not realize that not only are they at risk themselves, but they also pose a risk of passing diseases on to the young, the frail and the elderly. For example, adults are the most common source of whooping-cough infection in infants, who are at high risk of serious complications and death.


Mayor Trumpets High Demand for Pre-K
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio touted the city's expansion of free, full-day preschool on Tuesday, saying families signed up almost 22,000 children for next fall on the first day they could apply.
A new online-enrollment system, which lets parents rank their choices in district and community-based centers through the same process, made its debut on Monday. The city said 6,500 signed up on the first day last year, though that figure included only requests for seats in district classrooms.
At a news conference at the Boys and Girls Harbor preschool in Upper Manhattan, Mr. de Blasio said the high number of requests showed families had become more conscious of the value of prekindergarten.
It is "an amazing example of how much this has captured the imagination of parents," he said. Those who apply by April 24 will get offers in June.
Many educators have applauded the mayor's efforts to provide free, full-day preschool for all 4-year-olds, and have cheered the program's rapid growth. About 53,000 children are now in full-day public preschool, more than double the number last year. The mayor hopes to have about 70,000 children in full-day seats in September.


Netanyahu Culled Key Votes From the Right
JAFFA, Israel—Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured his re-election by tacking hard to the right and winning seats from his own coalition partners, a strategy that signals a sharper political polarization is taking root in Israel.
Mr. Netanyahu is expected to lead a coalition government tilted toward hard-line nationalists and religious parties. His cabinet is expected to include Naftali Bennett, whose party wants Israel to annex the West Bank, and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose inflammatory statements about Arabs made headlines during the campaign.
Mr. Netanyahu's shift to hard-line rhetoric in the final days of his campaign—including a surprise reversal of his official support for the goal of Palestinian statehood—propelled him to victory from a four-seat deficit in pre-election polls. His Likud party won 29 or 30 seats in the 120-seat parliament, according to various analyses by Israeli media and an independent think tank based on near-complete voting results.
The prime minister beat expectations not by gaining votes from the center, but by culling them from nationalist parties such as Mr. Bennett's Jewish Home party, which supports Jewish settlements in the West Bank. That party lost four seats in Tuesday's vote, as Likud swept up right-wing voters.
One religious party, Yachad, didn't receive the minimum number of votes required to sit in parliament.


Michigan Approves Land Transfer for Controversial Limestone Mine
The state of Michigan on Thursday approved the use of approximately 10,000 acres of publicly owned forest in its Upper Peninsula as part of a controversial limestone-mine project.
State Department of Natural Resources Director Keith Creagh approved the land transfer after a seven-hour public meeting that lasted into Thursday evening. It drew both supporters and opponents of the massive surface and underground mining project near remote Rexton, Mich., a hamlet where the population is aging and well-paying jobs are scarce.
"It's a very difficult balance" but "we have an improved application," Mr. Creagh said of Canadian mining company Graymont's latest plan that sought to address concerns by state environmental officials about royalty payments and future public access to the land.
An earlier version of the plan had been opposed by Mr. Creagh's senior staff. The staff endorsed an amended plan earlier this month after royalty rates to the state nearly doubled. In Michigan, Mr. Creagh said he has the power to sell public land as part of his mission to safeguard the environment and promote responsible economic development.
Graymont's proposed mine divided local residents on a largely rural crescent of land in the state that sits above Lake Michigan and along the Canadian border. The state's department of natural resources received more than 2,600 comments since the mine was proposed more than two years ago. It is believed to be one of the largest transfers of public land for mining in the state's history.


Huguenot, Staten Island's French Connection
More than 350 years ago, Huguenots—persecuted Protestants from France—were among the first Europeans to settle what is now Staten Island. One of them, Daniel Perrin, was granted 80 acres on Staten Island's South Shore in the mid-1600s and became well-known locally, historians say.
"So when people saw him riding his horse, they would say, 'Look, it's the Huguenot,' " says Rose Proscia, deacon of the Reformed Church of Huguenot Park, who has studied the history of the Huguenots in the area.
In fact, Mr. Perrin lived in what is now Rossville, she says, but the neighborhood named for him now stretches north from the Raritan Bay, and is roughly bounded by the areas of Annadale, Prince's Bay and Arden Heights.
Huguenot is a relatively large, relatively affluent area about a 30-mile drive from Manhattan, prized by residents for its central location and well-regarded public and private schools.
Today, some signs of its original settlers remain, and many streets are named for prominent Walloons, who settled the area with the Huguenots. The Huguenot church, established in 1849, was rebuilt in 1924 on Amboy Road and designed by the architect Ernest Flagg.


In Grief, Jewish Leaders Urge Fire Safety
As the seven Brooklyn siblings killed in a fire were buried Monday in Jerusalem, Jewish community leaders in New York City rushed to bolster fire safety in homes where hot plates like the one that sparked the deadly weekend blaze are commonplace.
Orthodox schools handed out smoke detectors to students, Jewish leaders met with officials from the New York City Fire Department to review safety procedures and city officials called for safety-awareness campaigns.
"Somehow people don't put the dots together," said Brooklyn Rabbi Moishe Indig, who noted other community members had died in fires after not installing smoke detectors. "It's very important to come together and make sure that this is the last time that this happens."
Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was "looking for ways we can change our approach" even beyond smoke detectors.
In addition to a public education campaign, "we'll look at other lessons from this tragedy and find ways to work closely with the community," said the mayor, who didn't specify what more the city might do.

Woman Killed by Train In Subway After a Fall
A 54-year-old woman was struck and killed by a subway train in upper Manhattan on Monday, police said.
The woman, whose name is being held pending family notification, fell onto the tracks of a southbound 1 train while walking between cars as the train was in motion, police said.
Police responded to a call of a person under the train at the 207th Street subway station in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan around 10:30 a.m. Paramedics who responded pronounced the victim dead at the scene.
So far this year, seven people have been struck and killed by subway trains, an MTA spokesman said. In 2014, 58 people were struck and killed by subway trains.


Some Pick at Math in New York City Affordable-Housing Strategy
In many neighborhoods, Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to spur construction of affordable apartments by allowing developers to build towers may face an unusual problem in New York City: The rent is too low.
City Hall plans to let developers build taller towers in 15 neighborhoods to jump-start affordable housing. But housing experts said that's unlikely to happen without city money in many of the cheaper neighborhoods the administration has picked so far, such as East New York, East Harlem and Cromwell-Jerome in the Bronx.
In many such areas, developers won't be able to charge enough rent to justify construction costs, especially if affordable housing is required, according to a new report by New York University's Furman Center.
In very high-rent neighborhoods, developers could set aside about 30% of the units as affordable to a family of four making about $50,000 a year, if they could build a building that is a third larger than currently allowed by law. But in a low-rent neighborhood, that drops to about 4% of the units.
"In much of the city rents are not high enough to generate high-rise development, so additional density isn't going to spur" developers to build, said Mark Willis, executive director at the Furman Center.


Details Emerge on Crash Victims
Outside the Joseph-König school in Haltern am See, a board painted with plain, white letters spoke for many far and wide mourning those lost on Germanwings Flight 9525: "Yesterday we were many, today we are alone."
As residents of this German lakeside community grappled with the loss of 16 students and two teachers on board the ill-fated flight, details emerged Wednesday about passengers—from close by and around the world—killed when the plane crashed in a remote part of the French Alps the day before.
"Caja and Lea and all the others—We'll never forget you," read one sign amid the makeshift memorial of candles and crosses outside the school, where the students had attended. Another poster simply asked, "Why?"
German officials haven't released the names of the victims of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash, but relatives and friends began to describe loved ones killed in the crash. Across Germany, particularly in the industrial heartland around Düsseldorf, where the plane had been headed, families lost business executives, artists and flight crew. Other victims included 51 Spaniards, three Americans, a mother and son from Australia and at least three British nationals.
Two renowned opera singers were among the dead: Oleg Bryjak, a 54-year old bass-baritone from Kazakhstan and 34-year old contralto Maria Radner. Ms. Radner's husband and baby were also on board. The singers were returning to Düsseldorf after their final performance of Richard Wagner's "Siegfried" at the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house in Barcelona, the Liceu said in a condolence statement. Tributes to the two singers poured in on social media; London's National Opera Studio called their deaths "a huge loss to the opera world" in a Twitter post.


Notable & Quotable: The Study of Military History
From remarks by Lewis E. Lehrmanat the New-York Historical Society on March 23, when the $50,000 Guggenheim-Lehrman Prize in Military History was awarded to Alexander Watson's "Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I" (Basic Books, 2014):
The study of military history has in fact been purged from many of the faculties and curriculums of the universities of the Western world. How did this happen? Perhaps it is explicable by some form of political correctness; or, parochial specialization; or, the armchair unrealism of the faculty lounge; even ivory tower snobbery—among other related social diseases. . . .
From the emergence of Homo sapiens in northeast Africa about 75,000 years ago, the DNA historians and population geneticists now teach us that there have been only three perennial institutions of human society—War, Trade, and Religion. Mister Churchill, long ago, reminded us that few of the major unresolved issues arising between nations, have been settled by little else than war—and by its consequences in victory or defeat. None has made the point so well as President Lincoln in his last war message to Congress of December 6, 1864. Between the rebels and the Union the unresolved issue "is distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war, and decided by victory." This is what President Lincoln said. And this is what he meant.
In a word, the world we inhabit is inscrutable without military history in its deepest and largest understanding.


Iran Nuclear Talks Could Push Past Deadline
LAUSANNE, Switzerland—With Iran nuclear talks nearing a critical deadline Tuesday, diplomats raised doubts that a meaningful deal could be reached in time even as the White House faces political hurdles in Washington to extend negotiations.
Gaps between the two sides include how quickly Western nations would lift punitive sanctions against Iran, and what types of nuclear research Tehran would be allowed to continue, diplomats said. Negotiators also are grappling over access by international inspectors to Iran's military sites, where evidence has suggested the possibility of past experiments on weapons technology.
The differences between Iran and international powers are so wide that any agreement reached by Tuesday would likely be vague and wouldn't necessarily be written down in a formal text, U.K. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned Friday.
Speaking in Washington, he said negotiators might need more time, holding out the possibility of extending talks.
"We envisage being able to deliver a narrative, whether that is written down or not I don't think is the crucial issue," Mr. Hammond said. "This will be effectively a political statement or perhaps political statements..to make it clear that we have now got this boulder over the hill and we are into the detailed work to produce an agreement."


Shooting at Florida Spring Break House Party Leaves 7 Injured
PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla.—Seven people were injured, some critically, during an early-morning spray of gunfire Saturday at a spring break party on the Florida Panhandle, police said. An Alabama man was quickly apprehended and charged with attempted murder.
Multiple 911 calls flooded in just before 1 a.m., reporting the shootings at the house party in Panama City Beach, and deputies found a sprawling crime scene with victims inside the home, outside and across the street from it, and in the street's median, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.
Officers set up a perimeter and found a suspect matching witnesses' description. David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Ala., was charged with seven counts of attempted murder and jailed awaiting a first court appearance. A .40-caliber handgun believed to have been used was found in the yard of a nearby home.
Sheriff Frank McKeithen said a busy party full of dancing young people dissolved into "a chaotic scene." Mr. Daniels was free on bond on a drug possession charge in Alabama, the sheriff said, and was accompanied by two others, one who had been recovering from a gunshot wound suffered in Mobile last week.
The two companions to the accused shooter were questioned but not charged. A woman who declined to give her name answered the phone at the home of Mr. Daniels's relatives and said the family would not comment on the shooting.

IRAQ
Tehran, U.S. Dispute Death of Two Iranians
Iran's Revolutionary Guard said a U.S. drone strike killed two of its advisers near the Iraqi city of Tikrit, where a major offensive is under way against the Islamic State group, but the U.S. said Monday its coalition conducted no airstrikes in the area during the time of the incident.
As clashes continued on Monday, U.S. Central Command said it didn't target the area around Tikrit from March 22 through March 24, the window when the Guard said the two men were killed.
The Guard said on its sepahnews.ir website that the strike happened March 23 as the men supported Iraqi forces trying to retake the Islamic State-held city of Tikrit. It identified the dead advisers as Ali Yazdani and Hadi Jafari, saying said they were buried on Sunday. It didn't say whether Iran contacted Iraqi or U.S. forces after the strike.
Iran occasionally reports on the death of its forces in Iraq and in Syria, where its advisers support embattled President Bashar al-Assad, but this is the first time Iran has said it lost forces in a U.S. attack in those campaigns.

23 People Charged in 'Sneakers Case'
The patients were recruited by the hundreds: Medicaid cardholders picked up at homeless shelters and welfare agencies with the promise of free sneakers and shoes, then brought to corrupt clinics for unnecessary medical tests and devices.
Those tests and devices brought in nearly $7 million in fraudulent Medicaid and Medicare billings, according to a 199-count indictment unsealed Tuesday by the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
Twenty-three people, including nine doctors, have been charged in the massive health-care-fraud scheme, which prosecutors say ran from 2012 to 2014 and may have involved thousands of patients.
Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson identified Eric Vainer, a 43-year-old Manhattan resident, and his mother, Polina Vainer, of Staten Island, as the leaders of what his office referred to as the "Sneakers Case" and a "Medicaid mill."
The Vainers are accused of directing recruiters to low-income neighborhoods and bringing patients to five medical centers in the Bronx and Brooklyn, where they received a battery of medical tests, including cursory foot exams, pain-management evaluations and cardiograms.


Obama's 'Quickie' Union Favor
You probably won't read it anywhere else, but on Tuesday President Obama did another giant favor for his friends in organized labor. He used his presidential authority to scupper a legislative challenge to the National Labor Relations Board's ambush-election rule.
In December 2014, the NLRB passed a final rule on a partisan 3-2 vote that greatly shortens the time for a workplace union-organizing election. This fits the pattern of the Obama-era labor board, which has been as biased toward organized labor as any in decades. So in March Congress employed a useful tool known as the Congressional Review Act to pass a resolution to overturn the new regulation. Mr. Obama issued a "memorandum of disapproval"—essentially a veto—to kill the Congressional measure and preserve the NLRB rule.
From now on unions will have unlimited time to prepare their campaigns to organize a workplace, springing the election paperwork on an employer when they figure they have the best chance to prevail. By reducing the time before an election to as little as two weeks from the current average of 38 days, unions will be able to lobby workers and make their case before a company can counter with its own argument. According to the Labor Relations Institute, unions win 89% in elections held in under two weeks compared to two thirds of the time under what have been typical election procedures.
The quickie rule also forces the employer to give the union personal information about employees, including personal cell phone numbers and email addresses. So much for employee privacy rights.
Though the Republican majority in Congress lost this round, using the review act is still worth the effort. It highlights Mr. Obama's willingness to bend the rules to favor his political friends and the election stakes in 2016.


Russia Bans Prominent Foreign Investor
MOSCOW—A Finnish businessman who is one of Russia's most prominent foreign investors has been banned from entry to the country for five years after authorities warned him that his work raised suspicions of espionage.
Seppo Remes, founder and chairman of EOS Russia, a Swedish fund that invests in Russian electric utilities, was denied entry to Russia for five years by immigration authorities on March 22 without official explanation, he said.
On leaving Russia 11 days earlier, he had been issued with an official warning by the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB. The document said his "collection of information on senior executives of state-owned electric companies and their development plans," though it didn't constitute a crime, "created the conditions for committing a crime."
As tensions with the West have exploded in the last year as a result of Ukraine crisis, Russian authorities have increased pressure on western companies, as well as nongovernmental organizations. In addition, they have announced a string of arrests of suspected spies.
Mr. Remes, who has lived in Russia since 1993 and invested in the energy sector from the start of Moscow's efforts to privatize it, dismissed allegations of espionage or information-gathering.


Criticism Mounts on Iran Talks
The White House began discussing its options in case of failure to reach a nuclear deal with Iran as faltering talks fueled criticism of President Barack Obama's negotiating strategy.
Iranian officials and Secretary of State John Kerry continued their quest for an agreement in the Swiss city of Lausanne. But American lawmakers seized on the lack of progress late Wednesday to renew calls for tough new sanctions.
The White House said Mr. Obama is prepared to walk away from the negotiations. Alternatives to diplomacy include stiffer economic sanctions, military action or an extension of the interim agreement with Iran that expires June 30, the White House said—exactly the type of measures that the Obama administration has said the talks were intended to avoid.
"In the unfortunate circumstance that we could find ourselves in, which is that we're not able to reach an agreement, then the president will have to consider that range of options," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
The six world powers negotiating with Iran missed the deadline Tuesday night to conclude a framework agreement outlining elements of a final deal to be reached by June 30. That deal would curb Iran's ability to make nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.

Sheet-Metal Union Settles Bias Suit
A sheet-metal workers local union in New York City has agreed to pay about $12.7 million in a partial settlement of a 44-year-old lawsuit alleging that it discriminated against black and Hispanic members, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday.
The settlement is aimed at resolving claims by blacks and Hispanics that when the union local farmed out workers to various jobs at various workplaces it assigned fewer hours to them than to whites. As part of the settlement, the union—Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers International Association—will create a back-pay fund, initially paying more than $4 million in damages to 393 black and Hispanic union members and contributing millions more over the next five years. The plaintiffs estimate the total will amount to $12.7 million.
The lawsuit was initially filed in 1971 by the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, the New York State Division of Human Rights, and the City of New York. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In 1974, the EEOC replaced the Justice Department as the prosecuting counsel.
"Unions are a key point of access for good jobs in the city and thus we take discrimination by unions just as seriously as discrimination by employers," said Robert Rose, a regional attorney for the EEOC, in an interview Thursday.


Woman Charged With Trying to Join ISIS
Authorities charged a Philadelphia woman on Friday with attempting to join Islamic State, the latest in a string of cases against Americans accused of conspiring to support the extremist group or carry out attacks on its behalf.
Keonna Thomas, a 30-year-old U.S. citizen who went by "YoungLioness" online, was arrested before she could travel to Syria and join the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, according to a criminal complaint.
Last month she bought a plane ticket to Barcelona, court records show, and was due to fly on March 29. Federal agents executed a search warrant at her home on March 27 and seized evidence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia said.
Ms. Thomas, who is charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, was ordered held until a detention hearing next week. Kathleen Gaughan, a federal public defender assigned to represent Ms. Thomas, declined to comment on the allegations.
As with others accused of trying to join Islamic State, it appears that Ms. Thomas's postings on social media drew the attention of law enforcement, according to an affidavit from a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent.


The Inspiration of Americans in Paris
Visits to Paris are what inspired two New York restaurateurs to open a French bistro as a complement to their American cafe.
At French Louie in Brooklyn's Boerum Hill neighborhood, head chef Ryan Angulo and fellow co-owner Doug Crowell are reimagining traditional fare from France and even the French dip sandwich, which has its roots in Los Angeles.
"I knew I wanted to do some kind of French bistro with American influences," said Mr. Angulo, who is also head chef and co-owner with Mr. Crowell of Buttermilk Channel in the Carroll Gardens area. "The focus is on the French, but we use American ingredients and some American techniques, taking inspiration not only from France, but places in the U.S., like New Orleans, and French Canada."
One of the most popular dishes is les soccas. The crispy chickpea flatbread acts as a base for either salad niçoise ($16)—tuna, olive aioli, a soft-boiled egg and salad greens—or roasted vegetables ($13), which includes beets and carrots served with mixed grains and harissa yogurt ($13).
The menu also offers a variety of other sandwiches such as the chicken paillard ($15), which comes with charred romaine, potato salad and anchovy vinaigrette. And the French dip ($12) is Mr. Angulo's personal favorite.


More Training Time Needed For South Carolina Police, Experts Say
A murder charge brought against a South Carolina police officer in the shooting of a fleeing man has some experts raising questions about the limited amount of training given to police in the state.
Since 2011, the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy has provided 12 weeks of basic training to officers in the state. Michael Slager, the North Charleston officer charged with murdering Walter Scott, received just nine weeks of training when he went through the academy in 2010, according to Mike Lanier, the academy's deputy director.
Nationally, the average basic-training program lasts 19 weeks, according to a survey of police academies released in 2009 by the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the most recent data available.
"This is absolutely negligent for police to be trained in nine or even 12 weeks," said Maki Haberfeld, professor and chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. But she added that the death of Mr. Scott is difficult to justify.
With police nationwide facing more scrutiny since the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., last August, police-training programs are getting a closer look.


N.Y. Teachers Union Robocalls Members About State Tests
In an aggressive move against testing, the New York State United Teachers union started robocalling members Thursday with a reminder they can have their children refuse next week's state exams.
"This is insanity," says the robocall's recording of union President Karen Magee. "Governor Cuomo is forcing schools to use tests as a hammer..We are fighting back."
The union has clashed repeatedly with Gov. Andrew Cuomo over his plans to toughen evaluations with more reliance on students' test scores. The Democratic governor got much of what he wanted in the April 1 state budget, which said test data must continue to be a substantial part of ratings for many teachers.
Tuesday marks the start of six days of annual exams for New York children in grades three to eight. After a spate of anti-testing rallies and social media campaigns by unions and some families, education officials are bracing for a likely rise in the number of children opting out, a trend seen in pockets across the country. In 2013, less than 1% of children statewide didn't take the tests.
At one East Harlem school, where no parents have told the principal they plan to opt out, parent Jasainia Ramos-Lopez said she wants her third-grader to learn how to tackle exams that will be a part of his life through college. "I want to see if he actually is as prepared as I think he is," she added.


Allies Split on North Korea Nuclear Threat
SEOUL—South Korea's vice defense minister on Monday dismissed an assessment from a senior U.S. military official that North Korea is able to mount a nuclear weapon on a missile that could threaten the U.S. mainland.
The comments from South Korea's Baek Seung-joo mark a high-level public split over the level of North Korea's threat as Washington considers a request to put a new missile defense system in South Korea.
Adm. William Gortney, head of the U.S. Northern Command, said last week that North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the KN-08.
"Our assessment is that they have the ability to put a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the homeland," Adm. Gortney said during a Pentagon press briefing.
Mr. Baek, who spoke at a news conference in Seoul, said Adm. Gortney's remarks were "not made with a thorough assessment of North Korea's capabilities."


Beijing Stomps on Civil Society
Chinese authorities last month arrested five Chinese women who were planning a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation. Amid an international Twitter campaign calling for their release, #FreeTheFive, authorities released them on bail Monday.
Hash-taggers are now declaring victory. Even though the women are under continued investigation and face severely restricted freedoms, their defenders say the case proves Beijing will bend to international pressure.
But did Beijing really capitulate? On Tuesday the Foreign Ministry said the government will prosecute Beijing Yirenping Center, a prominent Chinese NGO. The statement alleged the group, which fights discrimination against the sick and disabled, broke the law.
Yirenping may have been the target all along. The five women were among a larger group of feminist activists arrested just before International Women's Day, yet the others were released within a week. What set the Beijing Five apart is that they are all members of civil society groups, three of them current or former Yirenping employees.
China's nongovernmental organizations have proliferated in recent years, reaching 561,000 in 2014. But the authorities force groups to seek the sponsorship of a government entity, and those that act independently face harassment or closure. The Party fears any kind of organization not under its control, and periodic crackdowns track the Party's paranoia that NGOs represent foreign influences bent on igniting a "color revolution."


Mideast Project Violated NYU's Labor Guidelines
About 10,000 construction workers building New York University's campus in Abu Dhabi worked under conditions that violated the school's labor guidelines, according to a report released on Thursday.
Those violations included late or substandard wages, involuntary overtime and unreimbursed fees. NYU said its guidelines are intended to apply to all of its workers, but the report found that construction companies involved in the United Arab Emirates project excluded about one-third of the workforce, a group comprising mainly short-term contractors.
"The labor guidelines were intended to ensure that all workers..received the benefits of those guidelines," the report states. "Our investigation determined that this was not the case."
NYU vowed to maintain strict labor practices as it developed the 3-million-square-foot campus, enforced by a set of rules written and publicly released by NYU officials.
Conducted by the investigative firm Nardello & Co., the report was commissioned by Tamkeen, an Abu Dhabi government organization that is overseeing the campus construction for NYU.


Patz Jurors Focus on Conditions of Accused's Confession
As jurors neared the end of their third day deliberating in the Etan Patz murder trial Friday, notes sent to the judge indicate that they are focusing on the circumstances surrounding the defendant's confession to police.
The Manhattan Supreme Court jury is deciding the fate of Pedro Hernandez, 54 years old of Maple Shade, N.J., who is accused of kidnapping and murdering 6-year-old Etan in 1979.
Mr. Hernandez faces a kidnapping charge and two counts of murder, covering two theories of the crime: "intentional murder" and "felony murder." He can be found guilty of murder if the jury believes he set out to kill the child—or if he killed him in the course of kidnapping him.
The jury of seven men and five women began deliberations on Wednesday afternoon, following a trial of more than 10 weeks that featured more than 50 witnesses.
By Friday afternoon, six notes had been sent from the jury room, requesting to review, among other things, Mr. Hernandez's signed confession to police and instructions on how to weigh the admissibility of such confessions.


Brazil's Government Denies Allegations of Illegal Accounting
BRASÍLIA—Brazil's government denied allegations by a federal auditing court of illegal accounting to make the country's finances appear better over the past couple of years.
The denial follows a decision by the Federal Court of Accounts, known as TCU, to investigate what it says amounted to illegal loans from state-controlled banks to the Treasury.
Such loans are banned under Brazil's Fiscal Responsibility Law, enacted in 2000 to reverse decades of overspending that wreaked havoc in Latin America's largest economy.
The court ordered 17 officials, including Planning Minister Nelson Barbosa, to provide explanations in the next 30 days. Mr. Barbosa said this week that there was no wrongdoing under his watch.
The administration of President Dilma Rousseff says the suspected transactions weren't loans, but just late payments to state banks.


N.Y. Governor Breaks New Ground in Cuba
When New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo lands in Cuba on Monday morning, he will become the first sitting governor to enter the communist nation since the U.S. announced it would restore diplomatic relations with the country—and he will find himself in far more delicate diplomatic territory than he has ever encountered.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is set to lead a two-day trip to the country, ostensibly to encourage trade between New York state and Cuba. He will bring a delegation of 20 business executives, representing five sectors: travel, financial services, health care, agriculture and education, according to a senior administration official.
His travel has taken him to the center of foreign-policy debates several times in the past year, particularly during an Israel trip last summer when he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a low point in U.S.-Israel relations. In September, Mr. Cuomo visited Afghanistan as part of a U.S. military-sponsored excursion.
But Cuba represents the freshest and most fluid foreign-relations circumstance Mr. Cuomo has broached. He decided on it in the days following President Barack Obama's announcement of eased travel restrictions to the country, and it comes at a sensitive political moment for the two nations.
Earlier this month, Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro held the first meeting of U.S. and Cuban leaders in more than 50 years. Mr. Obama is now seeking to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.


Beijing's Secret Memo
The seven-year prison sentence handed down last week against Chinese journalist Gao Yu is revealing, and not only because the 71-year-old grandmother is the third elderly dissident prosecuted in the past year. Ms. Gao's case is especially instructive because her supposed crimes include exposing "Document No. 9," a secret Communist Party directive that underscores the central role of anti-Western paranoia in official Chinese thinking.
Issued by the Communist Party leadership in April 2013, Document No. 9 exhorts cadres to fight a life-or-death struggle against seven "false ideological trends" that imperil Party rule. These include: "Western constitutional democracy"; the belief that "freedom, democracy and human rights are universal and eternal" values; "neoliberalism" in economic policy; "the West's idea of journalism"; and "rejecting the accepted conclusions on historical events" such as the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.
"Western forces hostile to China and dissidents within the country are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere," the memo warned. "Western embassies, consulates, media operations, and nongovernmental organizations operating inside China under various covers are spreading Western ideas and values and are cultivating so-called 'anti-government forces.'"
Ms. Gao denies leaking Document No. 9, and the magazine that first published it, New York-based Mingjing News, says it had another source. Either way, its airing helps explain the rule of supreme leader Xi Jinping, who has tightened the repression of lawyers, rights activists, journalists, universities and the Internet. He has also extended Beijing's bullying behavior against U.S. allies and interests in the Western Pacific and declared that Asian security should be left to Asians.
But Document No. 9 shows the gamble underlying Mr. Xi's approach—that China can continue advancing while holding fast to Leninist politics and thought control. Mr. Xi apparently believes he can root out corruption from a one-party state without press freedom or independent courts. And that he can cultivate a world-class economy while banishing foreign tech tools in the name of "localization" and cleansing universities of textbooks that "promote Western values."


Walter Mosley on the Future of Reading
Reading is among the most distinctive practices in human history: the study of abstract symbols used to render beliefs, experiences, physical descriptions, theoretical explanations and ideas in books and newspapers, on billboards and even on TV screens.
Written language rigidly codified and yet continually changing affords us one of the few chances we have to exercise and challenge our intelligence and our minds, our creativity and our capacity for true empathy. Reading forces us to interpret the material world through a nonconcrete medium—the written word. These interpretations force an active, even an aggressive use of our minds. This usage increases our appreciation of knowledge and possibly our sophistication.
Where to?
This uniquely human tradition is infinitely complex, equaled only by the experience of love and learning on the job. The stories and the content gleaned from reading are different for any person picking up the same book. This is because reading has two components: the words written and the individual mind reading.
It is important to lay out this understanding of reading in order to answer the question, Where will reading be in 30 years?


Platte, S.D., Mayor Candidates Roll the Dice
Cards or dice was the choice in the South Dakota city of Platte on Thursday, but there wasn't money at stake.
Instead, the city of 1,200 residents was choosing a mayor. The local election two weeks ago ended in a deadlock with Mayor Rick Gustad, who's also fire chief, and former Police Chief Steve Christensen evenly splitting the 342 votes cast.
Neither candidate requested a recount in the days that followed, so under South Dakota law the winner is determined by "drawing of lots." At 4 p.m. local time the two men showed up at City Hall. Since Mr. Gustad is the incumbent, he got to pick the contest, choosing a roll of the dice over high-card draw.
Such an approach shows up in election laws across the country. Sometimes coins are flipped. Other times names are drawn from a hat. Games of chance have the advantage of being cheaper than voting again, often making them acceptable to local officials in rare instances of a tie.
In Platte, Mr. Gustad, who became mayor in 2008, bested Mr. Christensen two years ago by just six votes. He said local elections don't tend to draw much attention in the agricultural community, in part because its small population means candidates often run unopposed. Mr. Gustad didn't pitch any big plans as he ran for another two-year term.


Mayor Backs NYPD on Protest Response
Mayor Bill de Blasio, drawing praise from some of his critics and rebukes from his political base, on Thursday defended the New York Police Department's handling of a protest that turned into a melee Wednesday night as dozens of people were arrested.
At a City Hall news conference, Mr. de Blasio lashed out at the media several times while he acknowledged he was hearing complaints from "my colleagues, my friends, even my supporters" about the NYPD's response to Wednesday's protest against police brutality.
The demonstration, which began at Union Square and fanned out to other places in Manhattan, was one of several nationwide this week in response to the April 19 death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered fatal injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police.
In New York, police arrested 143 people, of whom 116 were released with tickets, mostly for obstructing traffic. Two were charged with felony assaults on a police officer; one police captain was struck with a stick and suffered a gash on his jaw.
Mr. de Blasio said the right to peaceful protest is "sacred" and a "fundamental American value." But when people engage in violence they "undermine any potential for the kind of conversation that could lead to social change," he said.


Man Charged in Shooting of Police Officer
A repeat felon accused of shooting at two undercover police officers Saturday was arraigned Sunday and formally charged with two counts of first-degree attempted murder on a police officer.
The arraignment came as new details emerged about a brash shooting that left a New York City police officer in a medically induced coma Sunday, fighting for his life.
The suspect, Demetrius Blackwell, 35 years old, was also charged with one count of aggravated assault on a police officer, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and one count of first-degree assault, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown.
In a Queens courtroom Sunday, Mr. Blackwell, who is being held without bail, appeared wearing a torn paper jumpsuit and entered no plea. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison. He is due back in court Friday.
"He's only accused. He's presumed innocent. He denied the claims," said Mr. Blackwell's lawyer, David Bart. "Everyone should give me a little time to develop the case."


Sorry, Charlie Hebdo
Je suis Charlie. French for "I am Charlie," the phrase became a global expression of solidarity and resolve after Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the Paris offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.
In a terrifying copycat attack Sunday in Garland, Texas, two men with assault rifles attempted to gun down people attending an event satirizing Muhammad with cartoons. A single police officer managed to shoot and kill both gunmen before they got inside the event. With some 200 people in the building, the potential for another politicized mass murder was great.
On Monday authorities said one of the gunman, Elton Simpson of Phoenix, had been under surveillance for years because of interest he'd shown in joining jihadist groups overseas. He was found guilty of making false statements to the FBI, but a federal judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence that Mr. Simpson's activities were "sufficiently 'related' to international terrorism."
Against this backdrop we have the extraordinary—almost comical—irony of some of America's bien pensant intellectuals boycotting a ceremony Tuesday by the PEN American Center to confer its annual courage award for freedom of expression on Charlie Hebdo. PEN is an association of writers, and six prominent novelists—Peter Carey, Michael Ondaatje, Francine Prose, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi—have been trying to repeal the award for Charlie Hebdo.
Ms. Kusher said she was uncomfortable with the "forced secular view" and "cultural intolerance" represented by Charlie Hebdo, whose signature attacks were on organized religion. Before the boycott, Mr. Cole wrote in the New Yorker magazine questioning the praise for Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the massacre. He lamented that the concern for Charlie Hebdo's murdered cartoonists won't be matched by concern for the young men of military age "who will have been killed by U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere."


Freshman GOP Senator Stirs Up Capitol Hill
WASHINGTON—Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton's temporary office is located in the less-than-desirable basement of the Russell Senate building, reflecting his rookie status. Like other junior senators, he performs his share of Senate chores, including presiding over the chamber. But the similarities end there.
Among this year's crop of 13 newly minted senators, Mr. Cotton, who served one term in the House, has emerged early on as the most vocal and polarizing newcomer, set apart by his headline-grabbing foreign policy.
The Arkansas Republican's tactics have drawn praise from his conservative supporters, but irritated some GOP colleagues when his moves have conflicted with their efforts.
Long gone are the days when Senate freshmen were expected to keep their heads down and mouths closed for their first months in office. Still, even in a chamber where newcomers, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have entered with a national following and not shied away from bucking their leaders at times, Mr. Cotton has drawn unusual attention, particularly for inserting himself into negotiations with Iran.
In March, Mr. Cotton provoked White House anger when he wrote an open letter, signed by 46 other Senate Republicans, directly to Iran's leaders criticizing the U.S.-led talks. And last week he called Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif cowardly on Twitter and challenged him to a debate about Iran's foreign policy.


Aetna to Stop Covering Routine Use of Power Morcellator
Aetna Inc. will stop covering routine use of the laparoscopic power morcellator this month, marking the most direct blow from a major health insurer to a surgical tool that regulators determined can spread hidden cancer in women.
The nation's third-largest health plan with about 23 million medical members, Aetna will implement its new policy starting May 15, a spokeswoman said. Power morcellation—which is used to remove common uterine growths called fibroids, often in hysterectomies—won't be covered under most circumstances, the spokeswoman said.
The tools are used in minimally invasive surgeries to cut bulky growths or the uterus into pieces so they can be removed through tiny incisions. But dangerous cancers can masquerade as benign fibroids and can be spread by a morcellator's spinning blade, significantly lowering a woman's chance of survival.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last year that women undergoing fibroid surgery have an estimated 1 in 350 risk of harboring the cancers called sarcomas, which was a much higher rate than had been generally realized.
In November, the FDA said power morcellators shouldn't be used on the vast majority of women. The agency also called on device companies to immediately add a "black-box" warning about the risk.


SEC Wins With In-House Judges
Joel Shapiro faced an uphill battle when he fought the Securities and Exchange Commission in an Atlanta court last year.
The investment-firm chief executive came before an SEC administrative law judge who has never fully cleared a defendant. In August, the judge found Mr. Shapiro had violated securities law, showing "reckless disregard" for his duty to investors.
The odds are once more against Mr. Shapiro as he challenges this ruling. His appeal will be decided by the SEC's five commissioners, the same body that decided the case against him should go forward in the first place.
Mr. Shapiro, who denies any wrongdoing, called the process "the most unfair, the worst thing I've ever gone through." The SEC declined to comment on his case.
An analysis by The Wall Street Journal of hundreds of decisions shows how much of a home-court advantage the SEC enjoys when it sends cases to its own judges rather than federal courts. That is a practice the agency increasingly follows, the Journal has found.


Burundi Standoff Threatens Central African Stability
NAIROBI, Kenya—A standoff in Burundi between protesters and a president trying to flout constitutional term limits is threatening to destabilize a precarious part of Central Africa.
In the nearly two weeks since Burundian President Pierre Nkurunzizasaid he would run for a third term, the capital Bujumbura has erupted into violent protests, leaving about a dozen people dead. Nearly 40,000 Burundians have fled the country since mid-April because of pre-election intimidation, the United Nations said.
"If this crisis lasts, it is going to trigger a new refugee crisis in the region and with the refugees come also the armed groups on the borders," said Thierry Vircoulon, head of Central Africa for Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group.
Burundi is tiny—slightly smaller than Maryland—but its location at the intersection of Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo makes it a potential powder keg in a restive region.
The 1993-2005 Burundian civil war between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis was intertwined with the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which in turn spilled into eastern Congo and eventually kindled a coup in that country. Today, eastern Congo is still home to multiple armed groups and is policed by a U.N. force.


U.S. Military Worries Key Iraqi Refinery Could Fall to Islamic State
Pentagon officials said they are worried that a key Iraqi oil refinery held by Iraqi commandos could fall to Islamic State control in the coming days.
For weeks, U.S. military officials have said that control of the refinery outside the northern city of Beiji has been bitterly contested between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants, who have long held nearby towns.
But Islamic State fighters have made inroads in recent days, reinforcing their positions around the refinery following their loss of Tikrit to an Iraqi force backed by U.S. airstrikes, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials.
"The Beiji refinery is threatened," said Col. Steve Warren, the chief Pentagon spokesman. "Enemy forces have put a tremendous amount of pressure on friendly forces in Beiji."
Col. Warren said militant forces control some sections of the refinery, but not all. Other Pentagon officials offered a more pessimistic assessment. One senior official said Iraqi security forces have been outmaneuvered in Beiji and that Islamic State is on the verge of taking over the entire facility.


Fewer Complaints Against Police Officers, but Review Is Mixed
In a year marked by protests against police tactics, civilian complaints filed against officers in 2014 fell to the lowest level in 12 years, New York City's chief police watchdog reported Thursday.
The Civilian Complaint Review Board said it received 4,788 complaints against New York Police Department officers in 2014, an 11% decrease from 2013. Through the first four months of this year the number of complaints fell from 1,776 to 1,290.
The report attributed the drop in complaints to a decline in the number of interactions the NYPD has had with the public, including the number of times officers stopped and frisked people and the number of arrests and summonses officers handed out.
At the same time, the review board, which investigates civilian complaints against the NYPD, highlighted what it said was an increase in the number of false statements by officers, improper searches and use of unnecessary of excessive force.
According to the report, investigators recorded 26 allegations of false statements made by officers in 2014, the same number recorded in the years from 2010 to 2013 combined. The report said that in 23 of the 26 instances, the complaint was substantiated by the CCRB.


Iraq War Persists as Awkward Election Issue
More than a decade after it began, the war in Iraq is still tying American politicians in knots, posing awkward questions for 2016 presidential candidates of both parties.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, after recasting his answers to questions about the war during the past few days, tried to put the issue to rest Thursday by saying he wouldn't, in hindsight, have supported the invasion his brother launched in 2003 based on flawed intelligence.
With that, he joined an array of potential GOP rivals who had scrambled this week to distance themselves from a war their party supported at the time.
The issue also is complicated for Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate. She faces lingering liberal skepticism for voting for the war while in the Senate, as well as GOP criticism of Obama administration policies that left Iraq unstable after U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.
Few people in either party seem eager to make the Iraq war central to the 2016 campaign. But the long, inconclusive conflict has shadowed U.S. politics for more than a decade, much as the Vietnam War did in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 elections in its aftermath.


New York Weighs Jurisdictional Rule for Foreign Firms
New York lawmakers are weighing a bill to make foreign companies submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts as a condition of doing business in the state, a position some lawyers say is at odds with a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
The high court decided unanimously last year to put restrictions on lawsuits filed against foreign companies in the U.S. that concern actions that took place abroad. Defense lawyers hailed the decision as a strike against "litigation tourism," the filing of lawsuits in a jurisdiction with no direct link to the issue or parties involved.
New York, meanwhile, is trying to draw more corporate litigants into its courts, with the hope of surpassing Delaware as the leader in business litigation.
"We do want New York to be a leader in corporate law," said George F. Carpinello, a civil litigator who chairs an advisory committee to the New York Office of Court Administration, which produced the proposal. "That's been the policy for many years."
The Supreme Court's 9-0 ruling in Daimler AG v. Bauman said a company can be sued in a state for actions that take place elsewhere only in limited circumstances—if, for instance, the company is based in the state or incorporated there.


Burundi President Makes First Appearance Since Failed Coup
BUJUMBURA, Burundi—In his first appearance before reporters since last week's failed coup, this country's president made no mention of the attempted takeover and instead warned that Somali militants are threatening his nation.
It was a surprising move for a man whose plane was blocked from returning to Burundi just five days ago while a renegade general said he had seized control of the country. And it raised concerns that the government was setting up reasons for an even more intense crackdown on the political opposition.
Burundi is in a political crisis over presidential term limits that is threatening to descend into nationwide chaos. The capital city has been besieged by violent protests for weeks as demonstrators, calling for the president to abandon his bid for a third term, clash with police. Some 20 people have been killed, and threats and intimidation in the countryside have sent about 105,000 fleeing into neighboring countries.
When Maj. Gen. Godefroid Niyombare announced a coup on Wednesday while the president was out of the country, the opposition-heavy capital erupted in celebration—young men danced in the street and ordered rounds of drinks at the bars. But the putsch was put down in two days. Gen. Niyombare's whereabouts were unknown on Sunday.
Less than a week later, those who oppose President Pierre Nkurunziza say they are facing an even tighter stranglehold. The only private radio stations were destroyed in the fighting, so there is no independent media operating. Meanwhile, a number of civil-society leaders who have criticized the government have gone into hiding or fled the country. Army troops are patrolling the streets of the capital in much larger numbers than before.


U.S. Signals Possible Iraq Shift
Defense Secretary Ash Carter held open the possibility of a strategy shift by the White House on Iraq, a few days after recent setbacks in Iraq and Syria revived sharp criticism of the Obama administration's approach in combating extremist groups there.
Islamic State forces last week captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi and also expanded their reach in Syria. Critics and even allies of the administration took to Sunday television talk shows to call for a strategy change by the administration to stem the advance of Islamic State forces.
Among the calls: More aggressively arming Sunni tribes and Peshmerga forces who oppose Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS.
"If there comes a time when we have to change the kinds of support we give we will make that recommendation," Mr. Carter said in an interview with CNN aired Sunday.
House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R., Texas) said on ABC's "This Week" that the battle in Ramadi was among the many reasons why he doubted the Obama administration's claim that U.S. efforts have succeeded in degrading the strength of ISIS.


Al Qaeda's Syrian Arm Shifts Tactics in War
ANTAKYA, Turkey—When a Muslim cleric criticized the Nusra Front last year for taking over his Syrian city and raising its menacing black flags, a representative of the jihadist group took to Facebook to send him an ominous message.
"Oh secularist, oh infidel," the note read. "Sit quietly or your time will come."
Yet when wider protests over Nusra's draconian practices and rigid religious views soon followed in cleric Murhaf Shaarawi's home city of Maraat Numan and elsewhere in Idlib province, the group took note. It curbed its threats to clerics and its attempts to spread its brand of Islam, said Mr. Shaarawi and other current and former residents of the province.
The response to public pressure underscores how Nusra, the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and Turkey, in recent months has introduced a measure of constraint and conciliation into areas of Syria where it operates, the residents said. It is even sometimes doing so alongside Western-backed rebel factions.
That has put it at odds with its main jihadist rival, Islamic State. While both groups seek to establish a state governed by a strict reading of Islam, Islamic State has relied on violence or the threat of violence to achieve that goal. Nusra, on the other hand, is seeking to win a degree of consent from those it rules and has voiced an interest in governing with other rebel groups.


Wisconsin Wage Retreat
Wisconsin has been trying to reduce the relative power of unions over taxpayers, but unions still control wages on public projects that cost more than they should. That makes it all the more surprising that the Republicans who run Madison are having trouble trying to reform this rigged system.
A state "prevailing wage" law pegs wages on public projects to those paid to union workers if the union represents more than half of the hours worked by a trade in a given county. Absent that, the prevailing wage is set by taking a weighted average of the top 50% of all wages.
The system benefits union contractors who are protected from a competitive bidding process in which they might have to compete for jobs against lower-cost contractors. Less fortunate are small contractors who often can't shoulder the high costs of complying, and therefore often opt out of the bidding. Taxpayers also pay more for what amounts to a super-minimum wage for construction.
A study by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that prevailing-wage rates, including fringe benefits, in Wisconsin are as much as 45% higher than market rates. In 2014 the state spent between $200 million and $300 million more for projects like town halls and schools.
An analysis by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty found that school districts would have saved between $163.2 million and $244.8 million over the past five years if they had been able to pay market wages. That would buy a lot of iPads or textbooks.


Tensions Simmer Ahead of Security Summit
SINGAPORE—China's island-building program in the South China Sea is expected to come under attack from defense ministers and military commanders at a high-level security summit in Singapore this weekend, amid concerns that Beijing is jeopardizing regional stability.
But China is sending its own high-power delegation, led by one of the country's top navy admirals, to rebut the claims, setting the stage for heightened tensions over maritime rights in Asia.
The annual Shangri-La Dialogue convenes at a delicate moment for the Asia-Pacific region, with Beijing appearing more assertive than ever in the South China Sea, and Washington having sharpened its criticism of Chinese behavior in the weeks building up to the gathering. Recently-released satellite images have shown a dramatic expansion in China's construction of artificial islands on disputed reefs, including one with an airstrip that appears to be large enough to accommodate fighter jets.
American officials said Thursday that U.S. surveillance imagery had also detected two Chinese motorized artillery pieces on one of the artificial islands.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who addresses the summit on Saturday morning, has already told Beijing that the U.S. will defy Chinese attempts to curb freedom of navigation in areas surrounding its newly constructed islets.


Changing Gender Designation
HARTFORD, Conn.—The Legislature approved a bill on Monday that would make Connecticut the seventh state to allow transgender people to amend their birth certificates to reflect their new gender without undergoing surgery.
Most states allow transgender individuals to make such changes on their birth certificates but only after undergoing expensive operations. Advocates for changing the rules in Connecticut said the state should follow the example of the federal government, which doesn't require proof of surgery to change Social Security cards or passports.
The American Medical Association says surgery shouldn't be a government requirement to change birth certificates, and the physician and patient who is transitioning to the other gender should determine the best course of treatment.
"We are updating and recognizing what currently is commonly used and is appropriate as a medical protocol," said state Sen. Terry Gerratana, a Democrat and co-chair of the Legislature's public health committee.
Many transgender people can't afford to have surgery or it may not be medically appropriate for them, Ms. Gerratana said.


Rising Gun Crime Vexes de Blasio
With shootings and homicides on the rise, Mayor Bill de Blasio called an impromptu news conference Tuesday to declare that the city is safer overall and that he has made improvements to the New York Police Department.
The mayor was responding to unwelcome news that emerged late Monday: Police officials said they are struggling with violence, citing a year-over-year 8.9% increase in shootings through May and a 19.5% rise in murders, from 113 to 135.
"There has been obviously an uptick in homicides and shootings," he said. "This is something we take very, very seriously."
Mayoral aides told reporters shortly before an unrelated bill signing on Tuesday that Mr. de Blasio would address the new crime statistics and take questions. He took three.
In response to a reporter, Mr. de Blasio said the increase in violence hadn't changed his position to keep the NYPD head count at its current level, despite a push from some on the City Council and Police Commissioner William Bratton to increase the police-force budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.


Two Friends of Boston Marathon Bomber Sentenced for Hindering Probe
Boston—Two former college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were sentenced to federal prison Friday on charges stemming from the removal of items from Mr. Tsarnaev's dorm room-—hours after his picture was flashed on television as one of two suspected Boston Marathon bombers.
Robel Phillipos, 21, was given three years behind bars for lying to federal agents about whether he went to the dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth with two others. Prosecutors accused those two, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, of taking a backpack containing hollowed-out fireworks as the manhunt for the bombers was under way, three days after the deadly April 2013 attack.
Mr. Tazhayakov, also 21, was sentenced to 42 months in prison for years for his role in trying to impede the investigation by helping remove the backpack.
The proceedings followed a related sentencing on Tuesday of 21-year-old Dias Kadyrbayev. He was given six years behind bars for also removing evidence from the room, thereby obstructing justice. He had exchanged texts with Mr. Tsarnaev before going to the dorm room, prosecutors said.
None of the former friends were accused of assisting in or knowing about the bombing itself. But prosecutors said their actions may have impeded the investigation and thwarted the search for Mr. Tsarnaev, who was still at large when the friends went to the dorm room.


Islamic State Rule Transforms Mosul
BAGHDAD—In Islamic State's stronghold of Mosul, the extremist group is working day and night to repair roads, manicure gardens and refurbish hotels. Iraq's second-largest city has never looked so good thanks to strict laws enforced by the Sunni militants.
But beneath that veneer, the group metes out deadly punishments to those who don't comply with a long list of prohibitions imposed over the year since it took control of Mosul on June 10, 2014, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former city residents, refugees and Iraqi officials.
Gone are the illegal kiosks that crowded sidewalks and the tangled web of electrical wires once connecting rooftops. New lamps light up streets unusually clear of cigarette butts.
"I have not in 30 years seen Mosul this clean, its streets and markets this orderly," said Omar, a resident. He said Islamic State has shown an unusual focus on civil works in recent weeks, which he and others described as part of efforts to win popular support.
Mosul and its population are changed in other ways, too. Gone are the iconic shrines and mosques that towered over the city center. The radical fighters blew many of them up because they believe the veneration of shrines is unholy.


California Orders Large Water Cuts for Farmers Amid Drought
For the first time in nearly 40 years, California officials on Friday ordered holders of some of the oldest and most significant water-rights claims in the state to stop drawing water.
The move, which could affect hundreds of farmers, had been expected for weeks and marked another milestone in a historic drought plaguing the state.
It came on the same day the Obama Administration pledged more than $110 million to help farmers and rural communities in Western states, where 35% of the land is gripped by drought.
California will likely be a major recipient of the funding. The state is already slated to receive $18 million in federal funds to temporarily employ as many as 1,000 workers displaced by drought. Other states can apply for such funding, administration officials said.
A preliminary study by the University of California, Davis, released in late May projected as many as 18,600 agriculture and agriculture-rlated job losses in the state because of the drought.


Prince George on Balcony as Queen Marks Birthday
LONDON--Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional "Trooping the Color" parade in the heart of London--and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Palace balcony.
The queen was joined by senior royals, including the Duchess of Cambridge, who made her first appearance in public since leaving the hospital with newborn Princess Charlotte six weeks ago.
There was no sign of Charlotte but George captivated throngs of well-wishers by appearing on the balcony in the arms of his father, Prince William, who was in full military garb.
It was the first time George took part in the royal tradition of gathering the extended family on the balcony on important national occasions. He was the youngest person there; great-grandfather Prince Philip, 94, was the oldest.
Prince Charles, William and Princess Anne were on horseback for the start of the annual ceremony, later joining the others on the balcony.


Sid Blumenthal's Email Discovery
Hillary Clinton says she turned over to the State Department "all" of the emails from her private email account related to her work as Secretary of State. And State has reassured Congress that it turned over "every" Clinton email demanded as part of the House investigation into the Benghazi attack. This must depend on the definition of "all" and "every."
The House Select Committee on Benghazi recently sent subpoenas to Sidney Blumenthal, the longtime Clinton political hit man who was in steady contact with Mrs. Clinton (via her private email) while she was the top U.S. diplomat. Emails show Mr. Blumenthal was advising two U.S. companies seeking Libyan contracts at the same time he was secretly advising Secretary of State Clinton about Libya. Mr. Blumenthal's attorney says his client had no financial interest in the two companies—though no one is denying that the friends of Mr. Blumenthal who ran the companies were looking for business.
So imagine Congress's surprise on Friday when Mr. Blumenthal responded to a subpoena by turning over 60 more Libya-related communications with Mrs. Clinton—some 120 pages. Politico reports that Members of Congress still aren't sure whether Mrs. Clinton failed to give the emails to State, or State failed to give the emails to Congress, which is likely to release the new emails in the coming days.
State's excuse for the omission is that it thought the subpoena was only for Mrs. Clinton's Benghazi-related email (not broader Libya correspondence). This is hard to believe given that Congress's initial early-December request—to State and Mrs. Clinton's lawyer—begins: "Please provide, as soon as possible but no later than Dec. 31, 2014, any and all documents and communications referring or relating to a.) Libya (including but not limited to Benghazi and Tripoli) . . ." There's that "all" word again.
There's a reason Mrs. Clinton kept control over her server, and deleted an unknown number of emails, and it's the same reason she now won't let an outside party review her records. She wants the public to see as little as possible so she can have an accountability-free pass to the White House.


Charleston Mayor Rallies City After Fatal Shootings
The deadly shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has trained a spotlight on longtime Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, a soft-spoken liberal Democrat who has been in office since 1975.
The 72-year-old mayor has cut a prominent figure in the crisis, rushing to the side of the families of the nine victims in the hours after the Wednesday night shooting, reiterating his call to remove the Confederate flag from outside the state capitol and saying he doesn't favor the death penalty.
Others, including Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, have voiced support for considering capitol punishment for alleged shooter Dylann Roof, of Eastover, S.C.
Mr. Roof, 21 years old, allegedly told his victims that African-Americans were taking over the country and "raping our women," and he purposely left one person alive to share his motivations, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
At a Friday night vigil organized by Mr. Riley at TD Arena at the College of Charleston, the mayor received a standing ovation. The large and diverse crowd sat quietly, as Mr. Riley spoke at length about Charleston's role in the slave trade and its long battle to overcome that history.


U.S. Watch
EBOLA
NIH Broadens Its Vaccine Research
The National Institutes of Health has expanded its research of Ebola vaccines and drugs into Sierra Leone and Guinea, a move that increases the chances of getting definitive results from clinical studies.
The NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with the Food and Drug Administration and other U.S. agencies, has insisted that the fastest way to get a precise scientific answer about whether drugs and vaccines work is to conduct a randomized clinical trial. In this "gold standard" of medical research, patients are randomly assigned to a new drug or vaccine while other patients get a placebo or standard care.
The effort has been stymied for several reasons. One is that NIH initially was confined to Liberia, where Ebola now appears eradicated. In Guinea and Sierra Leone, Ebola cases have ticked up in recent weeks, with 10 confirmed cases in Guinea and 14 in Sierra Leone in the week ended June 14.
The NIH drug study is a randomized controlled trial of the drug ZMapp, from Mapp Biopharmaceutical. The study has expanded from Liberia into Sierra Leone, where about 40 patients have been enrolled so far, according to H. Clifford Lane, deputy director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.


Notable & Quotable: Allen Weinstein
From "Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case" (2013 edition), by Allen Weinstein, a historian and former chief archivist of the United States, who died June 18 at age 77:
For the past 60 years, those disposed to believe [Alger] Hiss innocent have generally relied on conspiracy theories, most of which made the transition from the era of McCarthy to the era of Watergate to the present roughly intact. Some of the theories are inconsistent or contradictory but have an underlying theme: that Whittaker Chambers perjured himself. Beyond that, the conspiracy scripts alternate between named and nameless plotters who not only concocted phony microfilm to stuff into Chambers's hollowed-out pumpkin, but also constructed a forged Woodstock typewriter on which to produce stolen documents. Although such scenarios have been received skeptically by most Americans, those who believed in Alger Hiss continue to launch, discard, and occasionally repeat variations on these basic plot themes. . . .
As for the conspiracy theories themselves, we may expect that newer and perhaps more ingenious defenses of Hiss may emerge, if only because none of the many theories raised during the past six decades has proved persuasive. There has yet to appear, however, from any source, a coherent body of evidence that seriously undermines the credibility of the evidence against Alger Hiss.


A Bruised Mayor Has Another So-So Day
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called a news conference Thursday to discuss new policing strategies, sharing a stage uptown with Police Commissioner William Bratton. But at least five times, Mr. de Blasio wandered away from his event to talk on a cellphone or huddle with an aide.
The mayor was learning—in real time—about the final product of months of negotiations in Albany, where his aides have been frustrated by a process they have described as dysfunctional.
Mr. de Blasio was on the downside of a difficult week, as he navigated the final hours of both the state legislative session and City Council budget talks. The pressures have come from many sides on many issues, from real estate to policing and even to harsh characterizations of his political ability attributed (anonymously) to officials associated with the office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
"Right now, we are focused on policy," he said, when asked Thursday about the tough comments from the governor's camp.
"He didn't want the cops, and he got the cops," said Hank Sheinkopf, a prominent Democratic strategist who worked for the governor. "He wanted a lot of things in Albany, and he didn't get them. He got whacked around on both fronts."


Undisclosed Clinton Emails Seen Broadening Congressional Inquiry
WASHINGTON—Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failure to turn over at least 15 work-related emails to the State Department is expected to prompt a broader congressional inquiry into her email practices while she served in the Obama administration.
The State Department revealed this week that a small number of emails were missing in part or in whole from their archive of more than 55,000 pages of work-related emails that Mrs. Clinton gave to the department last year.
Those emails were obtained by the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks from Sidney Blumenthal, a close confident and former aid of Mrs. Clinton's.
Republican lawmakers involved in the investigation said the revelations raised new and troubling questions about the Democratic presidential candidate's compliance with the law.
"It looks like the State Department didn't give us everything that Blumenthal did, and Hillary Clinton didn't give everything to the State Department," said Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican on the panel investigating the matter.


Author Warns U.S. Military to Focus on China
WASHINGTON—Peter Singer, one of Washington's pre-eminent futurists, is walking the Pentagon halls with an ominous warning for America's military leaders: World War III with China is coming.
In meeting after meeting with anyone who will listen, this modern-day soothsayer wearing a skinny tie says America's most advanced fighter jets might be blown from the sky by their Chinese-made microchips and Chinese hackers easily could worm their way into the military's secretive intelligence service, and the Chinese Army may one day occupy Hawaii.
The ideas might seem outlandish, but Pentagon officials are listening to the 40-year-old senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.
In hours of briefings, Mr. Singer has outlined his grim vision for intelligence officials, Air Force officers and Navy commanders. What makes his scenarios more remarkable is that they are based on a work of fiction: Mr. Singer's soon-to-be-released, 400-page techno thriller, "Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War."
"World War III may seem like something that was either a fear in the distant past or a risk in the distant future," Mr. Singer told a dozen Air Force officers during a Pentagon briefing last week. "But, as the Rolling Stones put it in 'Gimme Shelter,' 'It's just a shot away.' "


High Court Strikes Down EPA Limits on Mercury Emissions
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday dealt a setback to the Obama administration's environmental agenda by rejecting the first-ever rules requiring power plants to cut mercury emissions and other toxic air pollutants.
The court, in a 5-4 majority opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, said the Environmental Protection Agency must reconsider the mercury rules because it didn't take into account industry costs before deciding to adopt them.
The ruling is the latest flash point in a debate between the Obama administration, companies and Republicans over the balance between protecting the environment and not hurting the economy.
The opinion doesn't prohibit the agency from limiting mercury emissions from power plants, and it doesn't formally throw out the mercury rules, leaving a lower court to decide how the case should proceed. But it puts the administration under pressure to redo the rules before President Barack Obama's second term ends, and it is likely to make the EPA focus more closely on the price tag for industry compliance when it considers future environmental initiatives.
Several companies with large reserves of the coal burned for power, including Peabody Energy Corp. , Cloud Peak Energy Inc. and Arch Coal Inc., saw their stocks rise on a day when a deepening of the Greek debt crisis sent major stock indexes reeling.


After 3-Week Search for N.Y. Prison Escapees, Manhunt Ends With Upstate Sergeant's Aim
OWLS HEAD, N. Y.—For more than three weeks, a small army of law-enforcement officers hunted for two murderers who escaped from a maximum-security prison in the northeast corner of the state.
Police flew helicopters carrying heat-sensing equipment to scour thousands of acres of forested rolling terrain in the Adirondacks. They used trail cameras, night-vision gear, police dogs and DNA testing to track the fugitives within tight perimeters ringed by yet more heavily armed officers.
But in the end, a manhunt that began June 6 ended on Sunday the old-fashioned way: by an alert local lawman who was a good shot.
Jay Cook, a New York State Police sergeant who grew up near where he confronted David Sweat while alone on patrol that afternoon, has been thrust into the spotlight after he wounded the escapee in the town of Constable, N.Y., less than 2 miles from the Canadian border.
Two shots from Sgt. Cook's pistol brought to a finale an elaborate alleged plot involving hacksaw blades hidden in frozen hamburger meat, prisoner paintings exchanged for tools and, finally, freedom through a manhole beyond the high walls of the Clinton Correctional Facility in nearby Dannemora, N.Y.


Episcopalians Vote to Allow Gay Marriage in Churches
SALT LAKE CITY—Episcopalians overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to allow religious weddings for same-sex couples, solidifying the church's embrace of gay rights that began more than a decade ago with the pioneering election of the first openly gay bishop.
The vote came in Salt Lake City at the Episcopal General Convention, just days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. It passed in the House of Deputies, the voting body of clergy and lay participants at the meeting. The House of Bishops had approved the resolution Tuesday by 129-26 with five abstaining.
The Very Rev. Brian Baker of Sacramento said the church rule change was the result of a nearly four-decade long conversation that has been difficult and painful for many. Rev. Baker, chair of the committee that crafted the changes, said church members haven't always been kind to one another but that the dynamic has changed in recent decades.
"We have learned to not only care for, but care about one other," Rev. Baker said. "That mutual care was present in the conversations we had. Some people disagreed, some people disagreed deeply, but we prayed and we listened and we came up with compromises that we believe make room and leave no one behind."
Rev. Baker said the denomination's House of Bishops prayed and debated the issue for five hours earlier this week before passing it on to the House of Deputies.


Greeks Hold Rival 'Yes' and 'No' Rallies
ATHENS—Greece's government and its opponents battled for the nation's support in final campaign rallies ahead of a referendum on Sunday that could change the fate of the country and of Europe's common currency.
Opinion polls show Greeks are evenly split between supporters of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's call to vote "no" to the austerity demands of Greece's international creditors on Sunday, and advocates of a "yes" to lenders' terms for a bailout deal.
The camps divided central Athens in two late Friday, holding separate rallies a few hundred yards from each other.
"I call you to say again a big proud 'no' to ultimatums on Sunday," Mr. Tsipras told a crowd police estimated at more than 20,000 people, who waved the flags of Greece and the ruling left-wing Syriza party.
"We can also say it in German: Nein, Frau Merkel, Nein," another speaker at the rally said before welcoming the Greek prime minister on stage.


Palestinian Authority Cracks Down on Hamas
TEL AVIV—Palestinian security forces in the West Bank arrested more than 100 Hamas members overnight Thursday, in one of the biggest crackdowns in years by the Palestinian Authority on the Islamist militant group.
The arrests—the largest number since 2007—come at a time of heightened tensions in the West Bank spurred by a string of attacks by Palestinians that have left two Israelis dead and several wounded in the past month.
Hamas and Fatah, the two main Palestinian political factions, signed a reconciliation deal last year aimed at sharing power, holding new elections and ending a long-running feud. The two sides have been seriously at odds since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Fatah controls the West Bank.
In a separate incident, Israel's army said one of its soldiers open fired on and seriously wounded a Palestinian rock thrower Friday morning on the outskirts of Jerusalem, prompting the opening of a military police investigation. State-owned Israel Radio reported that a Palestinian teenager died from shots fired by a brigade commander.
Confirming reports of the crackdown on Hamas, initially posted on Facebook , Palestinian Authority security spokesman Adnan Dmeiri said the police targeted cells of Hamas militants. "We do not want them to disrupt the safety of the West Bank,'' he said. "It's our right to maintain the safety of our people."


New Gay-Rights Push Faces Uphill Climb
WASHINGTON—More than a year ago, gay-rights advocates hatched a plan to advance their cause after an expected Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. The idea: craft federal legislation to prohibit discrimination in jobs, financial transactions, housing and other aspects of public life.
Executing the plan has turned out to be far more complicated than they anticipated. The bill has yet to be introduced even though the favorable court ruling came last month. There is disagreement about how to balance religious tenets against the proposed new antidiscrimination rules, while some African-American leaders worry that amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as envisioned by the legislation, could invite unwelcome changes to what they see as a sacred text.
The debate, unfolding on Capitol Hill and among gay-rights groups and supporters, shows that while the movement has been triumphant on the legal front, its political clout is still limited.
Advocates are bracing for a cool reception in Congress, where they concede there is scant Republican support for a broadly-written bill. A more modest proposal died in the House last year after passing the Senate. That plan, called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, would have barred workplace discrimination only.
Rather than try again to enact ENDA, advocates decided to push something bigger. The new bill would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity across public life. It also would eliminate a broad religious exemption that was critical to winning Republican support for ENDA in the Senate.


Pope Moves to Warm Ties With Indigenous Bolivians
EL ALTO, Bolivia—A giant statue of Jesus standing 13,000 feet above sea level beckons believers in this mostly indigenous city where Pope Francis arrived on Wednesday. But behind the monument, in tin-roofed shacks, shamans burned incense on metal fire pits in indigenous rituals that included Andean herbs and dried llama fetuses.
The scene in this city of one million, many of whom speak Aymara not Spanish, highlights the challenges Pope Francis faces as he began the second leg of his South American tour to Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay.
Indians dabble in pre-Columbian rituals sometimes frowned upon by the Catholic church and Evangelical Protestantism is siphoning off believers in the country.
Arriving in El Alto, the pope took steps to warm ties with a community that has nursed some historical resentments against the church, dating back to its New World legacy of colonial oppression of native peoples. Upon his arrival, Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, accepted a traditional indigenous neck pouch used to store coca leaves from President Evo Morales, the region's only indigenous leader.
"Bolivia is a land blessed by its people," the pope said, as indigenous women in black bowler hats and children in colorful ponchos waved the Vatican's yellow-and-white flag. "It is home to a great cultural and ethnic variety, which is at once a great source of enrichment and a constant summons to mutual respect and dialogue."

MASSACHUSETTS
Officer's Son Held in Alleged Terror Plot
Federal prosecutors said Monday they broke up an Islamic State-inspired plot to attack American college students by arresting a Massachusetts man on gun charges July 4.
The Justice Department said Monday that Alexander Ciccolo, 23 years old, was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms.
The complaint doesn't include terrorism charges. Prosecutors could add those later, as criminal complaints are sometimes used to charge someone with a basic offense while the Federal Bureau of Investigation continues its probe.
Mr. Ciccolo is the son of a Boston police captain who alerted authorities that he was concerned about his son's mental health and apparent attraction to jihad messages, a law-enforcement official said.


Walker Makes the Leap
Scott Walker jumped into the Republican presidential race Monday touting his credentials as a fighter for conservative reform. This well-earned reputation has launched the Wisconsin Governor into the top tier of candidates, but to win the White House he'll also need to show he has the knowledge and vision to expand his appeal.
There's no disputing Mr. Walker's political guts. In Wisconsin he dared to storm the citadel of liberal Democratic power by reforming public-union collective bargaining. Few governors have tried this much less succeeded in a left-tilting state. Mr. Walker's Act 10 broke the monopoly that unions had on politics in Madison, essentially sitting on both sides of the bargaining table as unions supported politicians who then rewarded unions.
The results have helped taxpayers by making government more affordable. School districts have been able to save money by renegotiating contracts and ending burdensome work rules. Individual employees have saved money by choosing not to join the union. Union membership in Wisconsin has dropped to 11.7% in 2014 from 14.2% in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, membership is down more than 50%.
This is why the national left tried so hard to defeat him, trying to recall him and GOP state senators and pouring millions into a state supreme court race to overturn Act 10. In 2012 Mr. Walker became the first Governor to defeat a recall and went on to win re-election again two years later.
This is inspiring to GOP primary voters who admire his perseverance and willingness to stand against the liberal onslaught. Fortitude for principle is a good quality in any Republican President who must deal with the liberal media complex in Washington.


Colorado Theater Shooter Found Guilty of Murder
A Colorado jury convicted James Holmes of murder in connection with a mass shooting that left 12 dead and 70 injured during a screening of a Batman movie in a Denver suburb in 2012, one of the bloodiest such rampages in American history.
The jury of nine women and three men rejected arguments by defense lawyers that Mr. Holmes should be found not guilty by reason of insanity because he was mentally ill and didn't know the killing was morally wrong.
Mr. Holmes showed no reaction Thursday as Arapahoe County District Chief Judge Carlos Samour Jr. read the verdict, which included 12 findings of first-degree murder. He also was found guilty of multiple attempted murder charges in connection with those injured.
The former University of Colorado, Denver, graduate student faces a possible death sentence or life without parole during a punishment phase that will follow the verdict.
His public defenders presented evidence at trial that he had grown increasingly unstable before the attack, and was losing a long battle with mental illness, which ran in his family.


One Sign of Inflation: Salaries for Some Presidential Campaigns
Donald Trump's assertion that he has "massive wealth" doesn't conform to standard Washington political disclosures, and neither do the salaries the Republican is paying top presidential campaign aides. Call it the long-shot candidate premium.
Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is being paid $20,000 a month, the equivalent of a $240,000 annual salary, according to a Federal Election Commission filing Wednesday. That is about 45% more than 2012 GOP nominee and multimillionaire Mitt Romney paid his senior staffers.
The campaign has paid Mr. Lewandowski more than $85,000 in salary, expenses and reimbursements for campaign-event costs since early April, when the businessman began recording expenses for his campaign.
James Merrill is drawing a salary of $10,000 a month as Mr. Trump's state director in the early-nominating state of South Carolina, where the median income is $3,700 a month. Mr. Merrill's firm has been paid more than $100,000 since early April, covering multiple salaries and expenses, Mr. Lewandowski said.
Mr. Trump said in an interview Thursday he was paying salaries competitive with those of other top presidential campaigns. "I want to have good talent. I like the people I have," said Mr. Trump, whose campaign boasted in a release Wednesday that his net worth has grown to more than $10 billion.


A Richer Iran Will Target the Americas
In the foreword to the 2014 book "Iran's Strategic Penetration of Latin America," former Colombian Defense Minister Marta Lucía Ramírez wrote that Venezuela's " 'axis of unity' with Iran embodies Latin America's growing distance" from the U.S. "This is not to distract from the many conflicts the U.S. is engaging in the Middle East or elsewhere," she noted. But she wanted "to remind our northern neighbors of the kind of disengagement in Latin America that led to a nuclear standoff in 1962."
Now the Obama administration has agreed to phase out many economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for its promises to disable parts of its nuclear program. The deal provides for winding down international restrictions on trade and investment with Iran. It is also expected to gradually liberate more than $100 billion in Iranian assets frozen by the U.S. and other countries.
This means that even if the agreement prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, it will make the world less safe. National Security Adviser Susan Rice admitted as much last Wednesday when CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked if "support [for] international terrorism" might be one use for the liberated assets. "In fact," Ms. Rice said, "we should expect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until now."
And not only in the Mideast. One likely destination for some of that money will be the Islamic Republic's military, ideological and terrorist activities in the U.S. backyard. As Joseph Humire, executive director of the Washington-based Center for a Secure Free Society, put it to me last week, "if Iran gets access to the global financial system, they're going to double down in Latin America."
Iran has targeted Latin America since the mid-1980s by establishing mosques and cultural centers to spread the revolution. An arm of Hezbollah, Iran's Islamic fundamentalist proxy, took responsibility for the 1992 terrorist attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. Argentine prosecutors named Iran as the mastermind behind the 1994 terrorist attack on the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) in the same city.


Turkey Riles U.S. Ally in Fight Against Jihadists
Kurdish fighters who are allied with Washington accused Turkey of shelling their positions in Syria, a sign of the difficulties Ankara and the U.S. face as they boost cooperation to fight Islamic State militants.
Monday's accusation came from the Kurds' People's Defense Units, a Syrian group that has emerged as the most effective U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamist extremists. Its role has complicated matters for Turkey, which is worried about growing Kurdish influence along its border with Syria and an emboldened Kurdish minority seeking more autonomy at home.
Turkey said its forces were fired upon from unidentified sources across the Syrian border and that it responded with artillery. It said it was investigating claims that several Kurdish fighters were wounded but that the Syrian-Kurdish defense units, known as the YPG, "do not fall within the scope of Turkey's war on terror."
U.S. officials said Monday that they weren't aware of any border attack but stood by Turkey's right to defend itself.
The episode underscores the fragility of an agreement between the U.S. and Turkey for American jets to use Turkey's air bases to strike Islamic State positions and help create a 60-mile-long buffer zone in Syria for moderate rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad. The details have yet to be worked out. Meanwhile, Turkey itself has also begun launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets.

FRANCE
Le Pen Wins in Court Against His Daughter
A French appeals court said that a vote organized by the far-right National Front to strip Jean-Marie Le Pen of his post of honorary chairman violated the party's internal rules, upholding a previous ruling earlier this month.
The ruling by the court in the Paris suburb of Versailles on Tuesday could set the stage for a battle between Mr. Le Pen and his daughter and party leader Marine Le Pen, over her efforts to sideline her 87-year-old father from the party he co-founded.
It also represents a setback for Ms. Le Pen, as the party prepares for French regional elections in December.
The National Front said it was "very surprised" by the court's decision, which will allow Mr. Le Pen to remain in a position he "no longer deserves given his unspeakable behavior."


Planned Parenthood's Harvest
Democrats have been picking fight after fight in the culture wars, believing they have the upper hand with socially liberal younger votes. But that assumption is now being tested in the wake of videos of Planned Parenthood doctors blithely discussing the harvesting of fetal body parts.
The videos, secretly recorded by anti-abortion activists, show the doctors discussing, among other things, the best way to ensure a "less crunchy" aborted fetus. It's gruesome stuff, especially for anyone who has viewed the sonogram of an unborn child. Planned Parenthood's defenders are crying foul over the secret taping, but these same folks didn't object when Mitt Romney was taped in 2012 discussing the "47%."
Their real worry is that the public might begin to figure out that Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider and that taxpayers are subsidizing it. More broadly, the episode might return the abortion debate back to a middle ground that allows some sensible regulation and limits on abortion.
Planned Parenthood's 2013-14 annual report lists $1.3 billion in revenues, including $528 million in "government health services grants and reimbursements." Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, says the "vast majority" of federal funding for Planned Parenthood's nonprofit health centers is reimbursement for Medicaid visits, and "the rest goes to things like teen pregnancy prevention and evidence-based sex education."
But money is fungible, and every dollar in taxpayer funding allows Planned Parenthood to use its other funds to finance abortion. This financial two-step evades the fundamental political bargain that Congress has struck since the Supreme Court made abortion a constitutional right in 1973. That bargain, codified in the Hyde Amendment of 1976 and countless times since, is that while abortion is legal, taxpayers should not have to pay for a practice they find morally objectionable.


Woman Jumps Barrier at White House
WASHINGTON—The U.S. Secret Service said a woman was arrested after jumping over a low barricade in front of the White House.
The barricades have been placed in front of the White House fence. They are roughly waist-high and described as "bike racks" by the Secret Service.
According to a statement from the agency, a woman jumped over the barricade around 7 p.m. EDT on Friday. She was immediately detained by uniformed Secret Service officers and charged with unlawful entry. Her name hasn't been released.
Earlier this summer, metal spikes were installed atop the White House fence, after a series of intruders made it over the fence and onto the lawn.


New Taliban Leader Vows to Continue Insurgency
KABUL, Afghanistan—The new leader of the Afghan Taliban vowed to continue his group's bloody, nearly 14-year insurgency in an audio message released Saturday, urging his fighters to remain unified after the death of their longtime leader.
The audio message purportedly from Mullah Akhtar Mansour also included comments about the Taliban's nascent peace talks with the Afghan government, though it wasn't immediately clear whether he supported them or not.
The Taliban appointed Mullah Mansour as its new head on Thursday when it confirmed that former leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had died. The Afghan government announced Wednesday that the reclusive Mullah Omar had been dead since April 2013. The Taliban has remained vague on exactly when Mullah Omar died.
"We should keep our unity, we must be united, our enemy will be happy in our separation," Mullah Mansour purportedly said in the audio message. "This is a big responsibility for us. This is not the work of one, two or three people. This is all our responsibility to carry on jihad until we establish the Islamic state."
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid sent the audio to journalists and others Saturday. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify the identity of the man speaking in the roughly 30-minute audio clip, though Mujahid is in charge of all communications for the group.


Bernie Sanders Shoved by Activists at Rally
SEATTLE—Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was shoved aside by several Black Lives Matter activists and eventually left a Saturday afternoon event in Seattle without giving his speech.
Mr. Sanders was just starting to address several thousand people gathered shoulder to shoulder at Westlake Park when two women took over the microphone. Organizers couldn't persuade the two to wait and agreed to give them a few minutes.
As Mr. Sanders stepped back, the women spoke about Ferguson and the killing of Michael Brown and held a four minute moment of silence.
When the crowd asked the activists to allow Mr. Sanders to speak, one activist called the crowd "white supremacist liberals," according to event participants.
After waiting about 20 minutes, Mr. Sanders himself was pushed away when he tried to take the microphone back. Instead, he waved goodbye, left the stage with a raised fist salute and waded into the crowd. He shook hands and posed for photos with supporters for about 15 minutes, and then left.


Trump Campaign Hit by Backlash Over Kelly Remarks
ATLANTA—Republican presidential contenders and some influential conservatives turned on Donald Trump over the weekend, after the celebrity real estate mogul made insensitive comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of Thursday night's GOP debate.
Half-a-dozen of Mr. Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination seized on his remarks in a Friday-night interview with broadcaster CNN to scold the billionaire reality-television star for caustic comments they said threaten to undercut their party's standing with women.
The pushback against Mr. Trump's comments began on Saturday, following a decision by organizers of the RedState Gathering, a well-attended conservative conference here, to retract Mr. Trump's invitation to address the group on Saturday night.
The episode, plus the resignation of a senior aide, exposed cracks in Mr. Trump's presidential bid, after weeks of riding high in the polls. It could mark a potential turning point in a race dominated by the celebrity billionaire.
Among contenders for the GOP nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took a moment out of his appearance at the RedState Gathering to denounce Mr. Trump's comments, calling on his rival to apologize for suggesting Ms. Kelly asked him tough questions because she was menstruating.


All the President's Certitudes
In a withering 1957 review of Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" for National Review, Whittaker Chambers wrote that he could "recall no other book in which a tone of overriding arrogance was so implacably sustained." Of the author's mentality, he observed:
"It supposes itself to be the bringer of a final revelation. Therefore, resistance to the Message cannot be tolerated because disagreement can never be merely honest, prudent, or just humanly fallible. Dissent from revelation so final (because, the author would say, so reasonable) can only be willfully wicked."
Which brings me to Barack Obama and his case for the Iran nuclear deal.
Who is it, according to the president, who supports the deal? It is, he said in his speech last week at American University, the unanimous U.N. Security Council, the majority of "arms control and non-proliferation experts," "over 100 former ambassadors" and "every nation in the world that has commented publicly"—with one lone exception.
In sum, the forces of good, the children of light, the 99%.

IRAQ
Islamic State Claims Blasts That Kill 58
At least 58 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in two blasts in eastern Iraq claimed by Islamic State in a province once considered mostly free of them.
In January, Iraqi officials declared victory over the radical jihadist group in Diyala province, which borders Iran, after security forces and Shiite paramilitary forces drove them out of towns and villages there, but the militants have remained active.
An explosion at a market in Huwaidar, less than 3 miles north of the provincial capital of Baquba, killed 51 people and wounded at least 80, police and medical sources said.
Islamic State, which controls large swaths of the country's north and west, said in a statement circulated online by supporters that the target was "rejectionists," as the radical Sunni militants refer to Shiite Muslims. A blast to the east of the city killed seven people and wounded 25. The attacks came less than a month after a bombing claimed by Islamic State in nearby Khan Bani Saad, which left more than 100 people dead.


U.S. Concerned About Turkish Attacks on Kurds
Turkey has launched a series of aggressive airstrikes against Kurdish militants but has yet to turn its firepower on Islamic State in Syria as expected, increasing concerns in Washington about the Ankara government's intentions.
Three weeks ago, the countries announced a breakthrough agreement to allow the U.S. to use bases in Turkey to launch airstrikes against Islamic State, and the Ankara government said it would join in the bombings. On Wednesday, the Pentagon said U.S. jets now based at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey had hit their first targets in Syria, which American officials cheered as a significant step forward.
The use of the base has strategic value for the U.S., making it easier to hit Islamic State targets just across the border in northern Syria. But some U.S. officials suspect Turkey is using its recent agreement with the U.S. to fight Islamic State as cover for a new offensive against Kurdish separatist group PKK.
A senior U.S. official said Turkey gave American officials assurances last week that it planned to wrap up attacks on the Kurds in short order, but it has kept up the bombardments focused on the group's bases in northern Iraq near the Turkish border.
"It's clear that ISIL was a hook," said a senior U.S. military official, referring to Islamic State. "Turkey wanted to move against the PKK, but it needed a hook."


Nursing-Home Rehab Raises Medicare's Tab
During his 2013 California nursing-home stay, Jack Furumura became severely dehydrated and shed more than 5 pounds, partly because staff didn't follow written plans for his nutrition or the facility's policies, a state inspection report shows.
Still, during many of his 21 days there, the 96-year-old man suffering from dementia received two hours or more of physical and occupational therapy combined, records show.
That qualified as what Medicare terms an "ultra high" amount of therapy to help with tasks such as walking, even as he deteriorated. And it allowed the nursing-home operator to bill Medicare top dollar for his entire stay.
The federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled, which pays nursing homes a daily rate for a person's stay based largely on the duration of therapy, spent $13,468.19 for his care.
Patients getting ultrahigh therapy—at least 720 minutes a week—generate some of nursing homes' biggest payments from the taxpayer-funded program. Medicare's ultrahigh rate averaged about $560 a day in 2013, a Wall Street Journal analysis of billing records found. The average was $445 a day for "very high" therapy of 500 to 719 minutes and $325 for the "low" category, 45 to 149 minutes.


Islamic State Destroys Ancient Temple
BEIRUT—Islamic State militants have destroyed a temple at Syria's ancient ruins of Palmyra, activists said Sunday, realizing the worst fears archaeologists had for the 2,000-year-old Roman-era city after the extremists seized it and beheaded a local scholar.
Palmyra, one of the Middle East's most spectacular archaeological sites and a Unesco World Heritage site, sits near the modern Syrian city of the same name. Activists said the militants used explosives to blow up the Baalshamin Temple on its grounds. The blast also damaged some of the Roman columns around it, they said.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday night that the temple was blown up a month ago. Turkey-based activist Osama al-Khatib, who is originally from Palmyra, said the temple was blown up Sunday. Both said the extremists used a large amount of explosives to destroy it.
Both relied on information for those still in Palmyra and the discrepancy in their accounts couldn't be immediately reconciled, though such contradictory information is common in Syria's long civil war.
The Sunni extremists, who have imposed a violent interpretation of Islamic law across their self-declared "caliphate" in territory they control in Syria and Iraq, claim ancient relics promote idolatry and say they are destroying them as part of their purge of paganism. However, they are also believed to sell off looted antiquities for cash.


Plotting Against the Internet
The Obama administration last week caved in to critics by admitting that it needs more time to give up U.S. protection of the Internet. But instead of delaying its plan, the administration should have killed it. Dropping the plan has become urgent with new evidence of how other governments plan to take control of the Internet if the U.S. gives them the chance.
The saga began in March 2014 when the Commerce Department announced that the U.S. would end its long-standing contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. American oversight gives the multistakeholders of network operators and engineers the freedom to run the global Internet without political interference—and is why China and Russia are unable to block the open Internet elsewhere even as they censor the Internet within their own borders.
The Obama administration at first claimed that the U.S. role was merely "clerical." This ignored the American exceptionalism at the heart of the Internet as we know it. U.S. oversight created a global Internet that protects free speech and open innovation, which are now core digital values around the world. Authoritarian regimes are forced to invest billions of dollars to close off access to the open Internet while they monitor and censor their citizens.
The Obama administration naïvely imagined other governments would keep their hands off Icann and the root zone of the Internet. In its announcement last week, the administration postponed the handover from its original deadline of September this year to September 2016, saying "it has become increasingly apparent over the last few months that the community needs time to complete its work, have the plan reviewed by the U.S. government and then implement it if it is approved."
The Obama administration pulled a fast one by extending the contract with Icann by only one year. The U.S. contract with Icann says renewals are for two years, which should have extended the agreement to September 2017. This would have given the next president the chance to kill the Obama plan.


Bystander Shot by Undercover N.Y. Police Officer Dies
An innocent bystander who was inadvertently shot by a New York Police Department undercover officer during an investigation into illegal gun sales on Friday has died, Police Commissioner William Bratton said.
Felix Kumi, 61 years old, described by friends as a father of two and devout Jehovah's Witness, died at Jacobi Medical Center about nine hours after he was struck in the torso during a gun buy that went awry, police said.
The shooting incident unfolded around 4 p.m. EDT along a street in Mount Vernon, N.Y. A suspect identified by police as 28-year-old Jeffrey Aristy was accused of promising to sell the undercover officer guns. At one point Mr. Aristy asked to be driven from the Bronx, where he had met up with the officer, to Mount Vernon, which is in Westchester County, police said.
Once the officer and Mr. Aristy arrived in Mount Vernon, a 37-year-old man jumped into the back seat of the vehicle while it was stopped. After a brief conversation, the man pointed a weapon at the officer's head and demanded cash, NYPD Chief of Department James O'Neill said.
It wasn't immediately clear whether there was a connection between Mr. Aristy and the gunman, whom the police didn't identify.


Five Hurt As Tree Snaps in NYC' Bryant Park
Five people were injured Friday afternoon when a tree branch snapped off and collapsed in Bryant Park, authorities said.
Three women and two men suffered non-life threatening injuries when the branch fell just before 4 p.m. in an area where chess tables were set up, officials said.
One woman, 23 years old, suffered a broken arm—the most serious injury of the group, police said. A 53-year-old man suffered injuries to his back and neck; another man, 23, had pain to his shoulder and head, authorities said. All three were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, police said.
A 26-year-old woman suffered an injury to her left foot, while a second woman, 33, suffered pain to her left shoulder and hip, officials said. Both women were taken to New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
Joseph Miller said he was playing chess in the park when the tree fell. "I heard a crack and then a bang," Mr. Miller said. "And then it hit some people."


Germany Renews Calls for Fair Distribution of Migrants
LUXEMBOURG—Germany's foreign minister renewed calls Saturday for a more unified response to the largest migrant crisis since World War II and said that European Union governments are warming to the idea.
"There is no way around a fair distribution of refugees in Europe, that has to be part of the answer to the crisis," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at the end of a two-day meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
"We had a lot of controversial debates today, some still reject quotas, but at least there is willingness to participate in a common European response," Mr. Steinmeier said.
He said the European Commission, the bloc's executive, will present a proposal for redistributing more than 100,000 refugees on Tuesday. "It is a higher number than the 40,000 we were talking about redistributing in the past months, but it is not meeting the needs," he said.
The plans are to be discussed by interior ministers on Sept. 14. Mr. Steinmeier also asked for a meeting of EU leaders, scheduled for Oct. 15, to be advanced in the first half of October to speed up Europe's response to the crisis.


Thousands of Migrants Reach Austria
About 2,700 migrants, desperate to leave Hungary for Western Europe, reached Austria in the early hours of Saturday and more were on their way.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said on his Facebook page early Saturday that his nation and Germany had agreed to allow the migrants to enter their territories, in light of the crisis at the border.
"We expect the number to constantly increase in the coming hours," an Austrian police spokesman said.
Hungarian authorities have struggled in recent days to contain increasingly agitated crowds at a major train station in the capital and at several refugee camps in the countryside, as a rising influx of people have sought refuge from war-torn areas of North Africa and the Middle East.
"Are you sure the buses (go to) no camp? Are you sure?" asked one migrant, who was echoed by several others at Budapest's Keleti train station, the scene of rallies by migrants for several days this week after authorities closed the station to them.


Towns Get Ahead of Capitals in Welcoming Migrants to Europe
BATALHA, Portugal—As Europe struggled to find a common response to a growing migrant crisis, this small town in one of the Continent's poorest countries quickly put together a welcome plan.
Two companies stepped forward with job offers for new arrivals. Mayor Paulo Batista dos Santos got school officials to agree to enroll more children and to set aside two vacant buildings for temporary housing.
Then he sent Lisbon a plan for Batalha to absorb at least four migrant families among its 16,000 residents. The answer disheartened him.
"They weren't quite sure how to respond to our offer, saying they would follow up on it after Portugal and the European Union had collectively figured out a plan," the mayor said. "It's understandable that a concerted effort is useful but the main issue here aren't quotas, but human rights and values we share."
Mr. dos Santos, like other local leaders in Portugal and elsewhere, are putting out their own welcome mats in the face of what they consider a sluggish response from national governments across Europe to the influx of people fleeing Syria and other conflict zones.


Kentucky County Clerk Files Appeal Over Same-Sex Marriage Licenses
MOREHEAD, Ky.—A Kentucky county clerk who was recently jailed for denying same-sex couples marriage licenses has filed an appeal that would allow her to continue blocking the licenses.
Kim Davis filed the motion Friday with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
Ms. Davis objects to gay marriage on religious grounds. She argued Friday that all the same-sex couples who sued her for a license received one from her deputies while she was in jail, so her office shouldn't be required to issue them to any more couples once she returns to work.
U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning wrote that his mandate to issue licenses applied to all couples, not only those who filed suit. But Ms. Davis's lawyers allege that order was issued improperly, and again have asked for a delay.

Turnbull Sworn In as Australian Prime Minister
CANBERRA, Australia—The party coup to install Malcolm Turnbull as Australia's fourth prime minister in just over two years has exposed deep unease about the resource-dependent country's sharply slowing economy and a political system that lets small groups of politicians oust elected leaders.
The 60-year-old former investment banker unseated Tony Abbott as leader of the ruling Liberal-National coalition government late Monday in a party rebellion, as voter surveys pointed to defeat for the ruling Liberal-National coalition at federal elections due next year. Mr. Turnbull was sworn in on Tuesday and became the country's 29th prime minister.
He now faces many of the same challenges as his predecessor, first among them how to revive an economy in which a recession may be imminent after 24 years of avoiding one. Australia's economy expanded just 0.2% in the second quarter from the first, the slowest pace in four years, as China's slowing economy translates into less construction of skyscrapers, bridges and railways—hurting demand for raw materials like iron ore.
"We need to have in this country..an economic vision, a leadership that explains the great challenges and opportunities that we face, that describes the way in which we can handle those challenges, seize those opportunities, and does so in a manner that the Australian people understand," Mr. Turnbull said.
The latest ouster caps nearly a decade of instability in Australian politics that has splintered both major political parties.


Five Baruch Students Charged With Hazing in Frat Death
Five Baruch College students on Tuesday were charged in connection with the 2013 death of a freshman participating in a fraternity hazing ritual, reigniting a debate about the place of Greek life at the Manhattan school.
A grand jury has recommended third-degree murder charges against five other fraternity members as well as the fraternity itself, and lesser charges against another 32 members, some of whom were charged Tuesday, police said. They expect to make the arrests in waves.
Chun Hsien "Michael" Deng died in December 2013 during a weekend trip to a Tunkhannock Township, Pa., house rented by Baruch's Pi Delta Psi fraternity. There, he and other pledges were outfitted with weighted backpacks and beaten by fraternity members during a hazing ritual, according to the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department.
Mr. Deng lost consciousness at some point, police said, and died after being taken to the hospital.
Pi Delta Psi didn't respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. An attorney for one of the students charged on Tuesday said the students were charged with hazing and hindering apprehension.


Feds Target Synthetic Marijuana in Major NYC Raid
Authorities on Wednesday said they dismantled an international ring responsible for manufacturing and distributing synthetic marijuana, a drug officials said is causing a public-health crisis.
Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said a year-long interagency operation resulted in charges against 10 people who allegedly manufactured synthetic marijuana with chemicals imported from China. They are accused of packaging and distributing the drug, known as spice or K2, to dozens of New York City bodegas, Mr. Bharara said.
"To put it simply, we have undertaken the single largest law-enforcement action ever in New York City to combat the spice epidemic," Mr. Bharara said.
Law-enforcement authorities searched five facilities where the drug was processed and seized more than 200 kilograms of chemicals and about 275,000 packets of the finished product, with a street value of more than $30 million, Mr. Bharara said.
The charges mark the first time the U.S. attorney's office has exercised its authority to target synthetic marijuana in New York City, officials said.


Migrant Crackdown Bolsters Hungarian Leader's Support
BUDAPEST—Searing images of Hungarian riot police shooting water cannon at migrants from behind a razor-wire border fence have put Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his anti-migrant crackdown in the sights of critics in Europe and beyond.
But the abrupt closing of Hungary's 110-mile border with Serbia this week have also turned the premier into one of few European leaders to have bolstered their popularity at home amid the continent's migration crisis. Outside Hungary, Mr. Orban has also become a hero to anti-immigrant activists, such as protesters in Poland who during a recent demonstration waved Hungarian flags.
The polarizing effect of Mr. Orban's crackdown has been on full display as Hungary's use of water cannons and tear gas on migrants Wednesday drew fierce condemnation from neighboring governments, multilateral organizations and opinion leaders. Serbia's prime minister assailed Hungary for what he called "brutal treatment" of migrants. U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was "shocked" by Hungary's actions, calling them unacceptable.
While Mr. Orban may have regained control of the border, "it's a Pyrrhic victory," said Judy Dempsey, a senior associate at the Carnegie Europe think tank. "What does winning mean when you close the border and there are queues of traffic? What does it mean for trade and the movement of capital? If this is the kind of win Orban wants, it's going to be terribly damaging for Europe. "
Since Tuesday, there has been little traffic across the southern border, as riot police, backed by helicopters, man a recently erected 11.5-foot fence. Crossing illegally is now a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison.


The Card Carly Doesn't Play
Asked during Wednesday's GOP debate which woman he'd put on the $10 bill, Jeb Bush named Margaret Thatcher. As Mr. Bush then joked that it would probably be illegal to put a British prime minister on American currency, eyes flicked to the woman standing to his left. Quite so.
Carly Fiorina isn't Margaret Thatcher, just as her Republican rivals aren't Ronald Reagan. Yet Ms. Fiorina has a bit of Thatcher about her—and in one way in particular. She isn't a woman running for president. She's a presidential contender who happens to be a woman.
That's new for the GOP. Women have made remarkable inroads everywhere, but there still may be no tougher realm than Republican politics. This isn't, as the press suggests, because conservative voters are old fogies who'd chain their wives to sinks full of dirty dishes. It's because conservative voters demand more from their candidates.
Women Democrats pander on gender issues—abortion, birth control, the myth of unequal pay. They promise female voters special handouts. They pitch their womanhood as a qualification for office. And their base loves it.
Women Republicans don't get to engage in such vote-buying. They are expected to be principled, knowledgeable, serious. They are expected to propose policies—sometimes unpopular ones—designed to help all Americans. And, because the general public (both right and left) is still new to the idea of a woman president, they are expected to do all this twice as well as men.


Pope Encourages U.S.-Cuba Reconciliation
HAVANA, Cuba—Arriving for the first time in Cuba, Pope Francis called Saturday upon President Raúl Castro and the U.S. government to further the process of reconciliation between the two countries while also asking the Cuban government for the means and space for the church to operate.
"We have witnessed an event which filled us with hope: the process of normalizing relations between two peoples following years of estrangement," the pontiff said under partly cloudy skies.
Quoting Cuba's 19th century independence war hero Jose Martí, Francis said the developing relationship with the U.S. was a sign of the "victory of the culture of encounter and dialogue" over the "forever dead rights of groups and dynasties."
The pope arrived to a 21-gun salute, and received presents of flowers from a group of Cuban children who received hugs from him.
The pontiff said the Catholic Church in Cuba should have the "freedom, the means and the space needed" to evangelize and provide charitable service to the island's people.


One Civilization Reacts to Another's Crisis
Walter Russell Mead's insightful piece "A Crisis of Two Civilizations" (Review, Sept. 12) is important in recognizing Europe's decline as the entry point for the hordes of displaced Middle Easterners. A resolute, growing, wealthy Europe would be more able to assimilate these invaders and intelligently manage their dispersal. A weak, suffering, challenged continent cannot deal with several hundred thousand immigrants, most under the age of 30, with many more to surely follow.
In the post-World War II recovery, Europe was defended by NATO, and the U.S. saved Europe hundreds of billions in defense costs. Europe chose to use those moneys for social welfare programs which have robbed the continent of its energy, work ethic and future.
Richard Klitzberg
Princeton, N.J.
The arguments made by Prof. Mead lack insightful and scholarly analysis of reality. With the exception of Palestinian refugees, there was no large refugee population in the Middle East before the war to remove Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Our leaders obsession with regime change unraveled the social system in the Middle East, decimated fragile coalitions among tribes and created the opening for the present evil.


Time for Principled Conservative Candidates to Speak Up
The Republican presidential race may sport a deep bench, but it's currently fielding some shallow front-runners.
Donald Trump, who continues to lead in the polls, won't acknowledge that Barack Obama was born in the United States. And Ben Carson, his rival who is rising in the polls, apparently wants a religious litmus test added to our Constitution's age, residency and citizenship requirements for the presidency. Meanwhile, Govs. Rick Perry and Scott Walker have dropped out due to lack of support, notwithstanding their executive experience and records of job creation and combating powerful special interests.
The news that the Obama administration will lift the cap on refugees the U.S. accepts to 100,000 by 2017 is likely to exacerbate the reactionary populism that has dominated the GOP race so far. Yet it's also an opportunity for the principled conservatives in the race to articulate a foreign-policy agenda that is more thoughtful than banning Muslims from the Oval Office. The refugee crisis in the Mideast gives Republicans a chance to display a more welcoming stance on immigration, a topic that has dogged the party in presidential contests since George W. Bush left the White House.
In an effort to accommodate the vocal but relatively small number of restrictionists who vote on the issue, some candidates will play to the fears and anxieties of Americans. The better course would be to remind voters of our proud and honorable history as a nation of refuge. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, about 125,000 Vietnamese were resettled in the U.S. Three years later, a second wave of Vietnamese began to flee, and they soon were joined by Cambodians and Laotians also escaping from communism. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter ordered the Seventh Fleet to search for and rescue the "boat people." More than 800,000 refugees eventually settled in the U.S.
Concerns today that terrorist networks could exploit our humanitarian efforts are understandable and legitimate, but they are also long-standing and should be weighed against a moral obligation to do much more than we've done thus far. The Obama administration's strategic priorities have made the refugee crisis worse. And there's no reason we can't put in place a resettlement plan that rigorously vets applicants to ensure that only bona fide refugees receive asylum.


Burkina Faso Coup Overturned
A weeklong military coup in Burkina Faso appeared to be overturned Wednesday as the country's deposed civilian leader announced he was back in charge just hours after the renegade army general who seized power said he would return to his barracks.
The country's interim President Michel Kafando, who was deposed last week, went on local radio and announced he was back in power and had restored the transitional government. "Dear compatriots," he said, "I am free of my movements and resuming service. The transition is back and is resuming the exercise of power." He added that elections scheduled for Oct. 11 would be put "back on track."
The speech came after coup leader Gen. Gilbert Diendéré announced he would leave the presidential palace, capping an extraordinary standoff in Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation that for a fleeting moment, appeared to be the scene of Africa's latest coup.
Instead, thousands of soldiers opposed to the military takeover surrounded the palace and threatened to break their way in, while six West African presidents flew to the capital of Ouagadougou to convince the renegade general to stand aside. Protests broke out throughout the nation of 18 million people.
Late Tuesday, Gen. Diendéré said he had signed a peace deal with the transitional government: "It would mean the return of all our men to the barracks and the return of our weapons to the armories, in comments carried by Radio France Internationale." But he didn't say whether the deal offered him amnesty for his actions over the past week, or whether he accepted Mr. Kafando's claim to the presidency.


Obama Counts on His Rapport With Xi
WASHINGTON—When President Barack Obama hosts President Xi Jinping on Thursday night for a private dinner, he will seek to use the personal relationship the two have fostered to reach across their countries' widening differences on military, economic and human-rights issues.
The White House arranged the informal dinner—to be held at Blair House, a guest residence across from the White House on the night before the two leaders commence more formal sessions—so Mr. Obama could outline his longer-term vision for U.S.-China relations and try to tamp down recent tensions between the two countries.
The president will use the setting to "step back, look at the strategic context, acknowledge the differences and some of the tensions that are there, but also look for what are the opportunities for the next areas where we can cooperate," said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national-security adviser.
Specifically, he said, Mr. Obama will propose over dinner that the two countries work in unison to defuse tensions with North Korea, as well as on global health and development issues.
Friday's state visit, which includes a formal meeting between the two leaders, U.S. and Chinese delegations, a joint news conference and an elaborate dinner, comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. The two countries are increasingly at odds over high-stakes economic and cybersecurity issues, raising questions about whether the White House's investment in Mr. Obama's personal relationship with Mr. Xi is paying off.


Lawmakers Fail to Override Christie Veto
New Jersey Democrats unsuccessfully attempted on Thursday to override Gov. Chris Christie's veto of a gun-control bill when most GOP supporters of the legislation decided not to buck the presidential candidate.
The legislation would have prevented people with a documented history of mental illness from expunging that record to buy a gun.
The bill passed this year with nearly unanimous support from both Democrats and Republicans. None of the 120 members of the state Legislature voted against the bill; eight lawmakers were absent for the vote.
Mr. Christie, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has been asked frequently about his position on the state's strict gun-control laws while on the campaign trail.
The governor vetoed the bill last month, saying it added to confusion in what he called the patchwork of state gun laws. Mr. Christie recommended a comprehensive approach to tackling mental-health issues and shootings.


Who Will Succeed John Boehner as House Speaker?
Rep. John Boehner's decision to step down as House speaker lays the groundwork for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a fast-rising Republican from California, to succeed him in one of today's most difficult jobs in politics.
Mr. McCarthy hasn't yet publicly announced his intentions, although he was on the House floor Friday buttonholing colleagues and asking to speak over the weekend to let him make his case. Another Republican could still challenge him for the job, although by late Friday only Rep. Daniel Webster (R., Fla.) had stepped forward as an alternative.
Any changing of the guard won't make the speaker's job easier, nor will Mr. Boehner's departure bring an end to conservatives' demands for an uncompromising approach to legislative battles. A debate about party strategy will likely play out in contests to be waged for lower-level posts.
One of the biggest potential obstacles to Mr. McCarthy's succession as speaker was swept away Friday when Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), said flatly he wasn't interested. "He's been very clear," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee chairman and GOP 2012 vice-presidential nominee. "He's happy where he is."
Another potential challenger could be House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who had been encouraged by some conservatives to run against Mr. McCarthy for the majority leader's post in 2014. Mr. Hensarling's staff wouldn't comment on his plans.


Boehner's Speaker Sacrifice
John Boehner's resignation as House Speaker, and from his seat in Congress, is an act of personal sacrifice and an education in the limits of political power when government is divided. The question now is whether Republicans will reboot with new leadership, or indulge in more disunity and dysfunction.
Mr. Boehner has spent nearly five years trapped between an implacable President Obama and an uncompromising faction within his own party. Conservatives blamed him for not delivering victories no Speaker could. The Ohio Republican said at a press conference Friday—he looked like he'd just been released from prison—that he'd concluded that "prolonged leadership turmoil" would damage the House of Representatives and the Republican Party.
Perhaps 30 or more backbenchers were threatening to depose Mr. Boehner in a parliamentary maneuver, and he might have needed Democratic votes to survive. The Speaker has resisted demands to try to defund Planned Parenthood in a continuing resolution next week, though he is among Congress's most pro-life Members. As with so many other recent GOP psychodramas, the debate is over tactics.
Mr. Boehner knows such a bill lacks the 60 votes needed to clear the Senate and that Mr. Obama wouldn't sign it anyway. So he has tried to guide his conference away from brinksmanship that could shut down the government because the tactic is pointless and would benefit Mr. Obama and Democrats.
Mr. Boehner could have personally endured more talk-radio insults about surrender. But better, and more honorable, to depart if leaving might break the GOP fever ahead of a 2016 election that could set up Republicans for a governing majority in 2017.


China to Co-Host U.N. Women's Conference Amid Questions About Its Record on Issue
UNITED NATIONS—When world leaders and delegates arrive here on Sunday for a one-day conference on women's rights co-hosted by China, they will be greeted by a campaign led by the U.S. to highlight the plight of 20 women jailed by countries such as Iran, Egypt—and China.
The campaign, called FreeThe20 and led by U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power, aims to highlight the challenges women face in pursuing the very goals that the U.N. is promoting at its conference on women.
The campaign questions Chinese President Xi Jinping's role leading the women's conference and criticizes China and some other governments that will attend but which nonetheless crack down on women activists at home. Three of the 20 jailed women are Chinese.
"We are telling the stories of women who have been imprisoned for expressing themselves or for exercising their rights," said Ms. Power at the U.N. on Saturday. "We still have a very, very long way to go," in achieving equal rights for women, she added.
Mr. Xi, who has been on a high-profile tour of the U.S. this week, will lead the gathering in recognition of a landmark U.N. women's conference that took place 20 years ago in Beijing.


Fears Over Australia's Border Laws Halt U.N. Visit
MELBOURNE, Australia—A United Nations human rights expert has postponed an official visit to Australia because of what he said was a lack of cooperation from the government and worries the people who spoke to him about conditions faced by asylum seekers could risk imprisonment.
Australia's policy of intercepting migrants trying to reach the country by boat and placing them in offshore detention centers, rather than processing claims for asylum in Australia, has been fiercely criticized by the U.N. and human-rights groups, although the government has defended the approach for successfully halting migrant trafficking and preventing a large number of deaths at sea each year.
In a statement released in Geneva, U.N. Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants François Crépeau said legislation enacted by Australia this year stopped him from freely gathering firsthand information about migrants and asylum seekers in the country and being held in centers in nearby Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
Mr. Crépeau said Australia's conservative government declined to provide a written guarantee that no one who met with him during his visit, which was due to begin Sunday, would be at risk of intimidation or sanctions under the 2015 Border Force Act.
Under the act, people—including those working at the detention centers—face up to two years in prison for making a record of or disclosing anything deemed to be protected information.


Latvian Foreign Minister Says Syria May Overshadow Ukraine
NEW YORK—Russia remains a threat to Ukraine, and the fate of the country cannot be a "bargaining chip" in efforts to enlist Moscow's help to solve the Syrian crisis, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics warned Sunday.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Rinkevics welcomed the recent lull in violence in eastern Ukraine. However, with western officials saying separatist and Russian forces and heavy weapons remain in the region, he warned that the easing of tensions is far from irreversible.
"I am afraid that if we don't pay attention to Ukraine now, at some point in time, we can see that things can again deteriorate again significantly," he said. "I think that we still have that threat hanging there."
Mr. Rinkevics was speaking as diplomatic efforts to stem the crisis in Syria intensify in New York. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama will likely discuss the issue when they meet on Monday. Senior U.S. and European officials discussed Syria with the Assad regime's other main backer, Iran, over the weekend.
However, efforts to work with Russia on the Syrian situation have been complicated by tensions over Ukraine. The U.S. and the European Union have imposed broad economic sanctions on Moscow as a result of its intervention in Ukraine. They say those measures can only be lifted if Russia fully implements February's cease-fire agreements, signed in the Belarus capital of Minsk.


Judges' Elections Get New Scrutiny
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson's quick transformation from a candidate for re-election to a nominee for state court justice—without a vote being cast—is raising questions about the clout that state election law gives to party leaders and shedding light on New York's largely obscure judicial electoral system.
Judicial delegates for the Democratic Party in the Bronx gathered in a low-ceilinged ballroom Thursday night to nominate Mr. Johnson to one of six spots on this year's ballot for state Supreme Court in the borough. Mr. Johnson is all but assured the seat in the Nov. 3 election because the Bronx is overwhelmingly Democratic.
For years, the state's judicial-selection process has been criticized as opaque and undemocratic, a system in which delegates—often party loyalists, including elected officials and their family members—rubber-stamp candidates handpicked by county party leaders.
In the Bronx Thursday, there wasn't a dissenting vote cast, or an alternate candidate put forward to run in November.
"To say it is an election is a joke," said Michael Cardozo, who served as New York City's chief legal officer under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and for years led efforts to change the process. "You are playing right into the party bosses' hands, completely."


Rivalry for House GOP Leadership Heats Up
WASHINGTON—One late night in March, House GOP leaders including Majority Whip Steve Scalise went around House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, calling Republicans on his panel in a bid to convince them to add more defense funding to the House GOP budget.
It didn't work. Mr. Price, of Georgia, had warned the leaders that Republicans on the budget panel would balk at boosting military funding without finding cuts elsewhere. But the budget that cleared his committee that morning couldn't pass the full House until Mr. Scalise and other leaders intervened. They deployed a rare procedural gambit on the House floor to add $2 billion in military spending and remove restrictions around another $20 billion.
Now the debate about military spending that nearly derailed Mr. Price's fiscal blueprint is back—this time in a race for the next majority leader shaping up between Messrs. Price and Scalise.
While leadership elections turn primarily on which candidates are better connected, more generous in donating to their colleagues' campaigns and most efficient in snapping up early allies, this time a policy difference could be key: The question of whether a long-term budget deal should boost military spending.
The issue is coming to the fore as House Republicans prepare for life after House Speaker John Boehner. With Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) facing little competition to be the next speaker, the battle about Pentagon funding is concentrated in the race to succeed him.


Florida Shooting Leaves Three Dead, Including Gunman
A gunman in rural Inglis, Fla., killed two people and injured another before taking his own life, the Levy County Sheriff's Office said late Thursday.
Sheriff's office spokesman Lt. Scott Tummond said the incident was believed to stem from a domestic dispute, but authorities were still investigating. The incident came just hours after a shooting at an Oregon college on Thursday that left at least 10 people dead, including the gunman.
Lt. Tummond said law enforcement began receiving 911 calls around 6 p.m. Thursday reporting shots fired at a house near the town hall in Inglis, about 90 miles north of Tampa.
Emergency medical personnel responded and found one man dead in the front yard and another seriously injured, Mr. Tummond said. The injured man was flown by helicopter to a hospital for treatment.
When law enforcement arrived, officers surrounded the home and saw a man through an upper-story window, Lt. Tummond said. The man turned around, disappeared, and authorities "heard a single gunshot and a thud," he said.


Weighing Google's Antitrust Defenses
Antitrust allegations that Google 's search-engine rankings favor its own interests at the expense of competitors and consumers have been around for nearly a decade. But charges of search bias are in the news again. In April the European Commission announced a preliminary finding that systematic self-favoritism in Google's search engine constitutes "abuse of a dominant position." India's Competition Director General followed in August, reportedly recommending antitrust charges based on search manipulation.
Google has already successfully deflected similar allegations in the U.S. In 2013 the Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously to close its investigation of search-engine bias without filing a complaint. The inadvertent partial release of an internal staff report earlier this year fell short of exoneration, stating that "evidence paints a complex portrait of a company working toward an overall goal of maintaining its market share by providing the best user experience, while simultaneously engaging in tactics that resulted in harm to many vertical competitors." Google vehemently denies any wrong doing.
American antitrust law has evolved to protect competition within an ever-changing industrial landscape. Conduct that unfairly stifles competition is illegal. But being big and powerful is neither unlawful in itself nor proof of inappropriate conduct. Success may reflect instead superior innovation that should be encouraged. And yet innovation's competitive consequences, whether actual or alleged, are not always unambiguous.
Google's primary defense to the FTC appears to have been that the frequent changes to its search algorithm constitute innovations that improved the quality of its search results and were not anticompetitive. The success of this argument before the FTC should not be read narrowly as an endorsement of Google's position. Rather, the outcome also reflects antitrust law's unwillingness to, as the FTC wrote when closing its Google investigation, "second-guess a firm's product design decisions."
Antitrust analysis routinely requires balancing procompetitive and anticompetitive effects of suspect conduct. But the balancing act can be difficult. Especially in the case of information products, a small procompetitive innovation may be paired with large anticompetitive effects. A single "innovation" may include numerous changes, each with distinct competitive effects. That is why antitrust tribunals faced with such a defense often persuade themselves to forgo balancing altogether, and instead let any nontrivial innovation trump all else.


Obama Presses for Gun Reform in Wake of Oregon Shooting
WASHINGTON—A visibly angry President Barack Obama addressed the nation in the wake of another mass shooting on Thursday, calling for Americans to press politicians for stricter gun regulation.
Mr. Obama called such tragedies a "a political choice that we make—to allow this to happen every few months in America."
"This is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic," he said, speaking from the White House briefing room.
The president's remarks were prompted by a shooting at Umpqua Community College, outside Roseburg, Ore., which is about 180 miles south of Portland. Police have reported multiple fatalities and casualties.
Mr. Obama noted that making remarks in the wake of a mass shooting has been a grim ritual of his presidency. The president made his case for implementing firearms restrictions that powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association have been largely opposed.


Behind Blur of Motion at Chick-fil-A, Years of Planning
In 2010, Chick-fil-A officials toured a Toyota factory and tried to apply the Japanese auto maker's efficiency principles to chicken-sandwich assembly.
Last year, Chick-fil-A built a full-scale model of the future three-level New York City store.
About six months ago, the company began piloting a color-coding system for customer movement whereby workers take orders on iPads while people are still in line. The orders are then beamed to one of four teams—red, green, blue and brown—involving the register, food assembly and kitchen workers so that orders are ready by the time customers arrive at the counter.
The bustling Chick-fil-A in Midtown Manhattan, which opened last weekend, is the chain's first stand-alone location in the city. It is the culmination of nearly two years of logistical planning, part of the company push to expand into urban centers.
"A lot of Americans are beginning to move back into the city," said Chick-fil-A consultant Ryan Holmes. He said the chain's so-called urban-strategy team was formed about three years ago.


Top Republican Urges Yellen to Comply with Congressional Subpoena
A top Republican lawmaker alleged Tuesday that the Federal Reserve has maneuvered to delay efforts by congressional staff to investigate a 2012 leak of sensitive central bank information.
The Fed has allowed House investigators in recent weeks to privately review confidential documents related to its investigation of the leak. But in a letter to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) said the central bank only offered to provide access to the documents "at the 11th hour" in an attempt to delay a planned interview by the House Financial Services Committee with the Fed's general counsel. That interview was subsequently postponed.
After reviewing the documents at the Fed, Mr. Duffy said the committee believes the Fed has no legal basis for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena seeking more details about the disclosure of sensitive policy deliberations following the Fed's September 2012 policy meeting.
The Fed has repeatedly said it cannot turn over the information because its inspector general has warned that doing so could interfere with a criminal probe by the IG and the Justice Department.
A Fed spokeswoman said the central bank has never refused a request for committee staff to interview Fed staff about the leak.


Malaysia Arrests Another Critic of Prime Minister
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—A prominent lawyer was arrested Thursday on charges of sabotage, his attorney said, after earlier planning to travel to the U.S. to help urge authorities there to investigate money transfers into Prime Minister Najib Razak's alleged personal accounts.
The lawyer, Matthias Chang, was arrested after visiting a police lockup facility to see Khairuddin Abu Hassan, who was arrested and detained last month on the same charge. The two men had planned to fly together to the U.S., where Mr. Chang previously said Mr. Khairuddin aimed to try to persuade U.S. authorities to investigate transfers into Mr. Najib's alleged accounts. Mr. Chang was acting as Mr. Khairuddin's personal lawyer to make sure he complied with legal processes and laws oversees, Mr. Chang's attorney Zainur Zakaria said.
Both men are being held under Malaysia's sweeping Security Offenses (Special Measures) Act, which allows for them to be detained for 28 days, another lawyer acting for Mr. Chang said.
"Matthias and I visited Mr. Khairuddin this afternoon at 2 p.m. for about 30 minutes," lawyer Mohd Akmal Afiq Mohd said by telephone. "When we came out, police informed Matthias he was being arrested."
A Malaysian police representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment.


House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Exits Race for Speaker
WASHINGTON—Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy unexpectedly dropped out of the race to become speaker Thursday, plunging House Republicans into chaos and extending the struggles that have racked the party for years.
The California Republican, who will remain in the party's No. 2 leadership post, faced opposition from conservatives itching to use hardball tactics against President Barack Obama and Democrats. They have clashed repeatedly with other GOP lawmakers willing to make concessions to keep the government running smoothly, and pledged to block Mr. McCarthy from being elected as speaker.
His withdrawal leaves a leadership vacuum that Republicans were scrambling to fill. Many said they hoped to persuade Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) to run for the post, even after Mr. Ryan declined for a second time on Thursday. "He's really the only one that can do the job," Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) said. "Most of the members know that that's really our only path forward at this point."
If Mr. Ryan sticks to his decision not to run, lawmakers said they expected Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) to remain in that post beyond his intended Oct. 30 resignation, possibly through year-end.
House Republicans will meet Friday morning in an effort to find their footing before breaking for a one-week Columbus Day recess—and as other legislative deadlines approach. Most pressing, the Treasury Department has said Congress must raise the federal government's borrowing limit by Nov. 5 so that it can continue to pay bills on time. Lawmakers also are working to reach a two-year budget deal before the government's current funding expires on Dec. 11.


Obama's Options Narrow in Syria
WASHINGTON—Ten days into a Russian military campaign that has upended U.S. policy in Syria, President Barack Obama is picking from two bad options for how to respond.
The U.S. is hesitant to become more involved in Syria's bloody and messy civil war, at the risk of forcing a proxy war with Russia. The president's goal continues to be resisting any greater U.S. military commitment, aides say.
That leaves one other choice: to accept Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's hold on power, even though U.S. policy calls for his removal, and hope to negotiate his exit when the battlefield is less volatile.
On Friday, the Pentagon said it would abandon its failed, $500-million program to build an army of opposition fighters in Syria in favor of an effort to directly arm favored Syrian rebel commanders to fight Islamic State.
U.S. officials are no longer demanding Mr. Assad must step down immediately. Rather they are advocating a "managed" transition in which Mr. Assad could remain in Syria for some time.


Justice, Education Departments Coordinate University of Phoenix Probes
The Justice Department and the Department of Education are coordinating on ongoing investigations of the University of Phoenix, a government official said Friday, a day after the Defense Department barred the for-profit school giant from recruiting on military bases and placed it on probation for alleged recruiting violations.
Shares in Apollo Education Group Inc., Phoenix's parent company, plummeted nearly 9% on Friday after the news late Thursday that the Defense Department said it would no longer allow the school to enroll new students who are using the department's tuition assistance program. The program provides financial aid to currently serving troops.
In June, the Department of Education said it had established an interagency task force, led by Under Secretary Ted Mitchell, to help ensure proper accountability for and oversight of career colleges and for-profit institutions. A government official said the investigations are ongoing but declined to comment further.
University of Phoenix President Tim Slottow said late Thursday that the Defense Department letter announcing the move, which the school received on Wednesday evening, caught school officials off guard.
"The University intends to continue its cooperation with federal and state agencies to respond to their requests," he said in a statement. "University representatives have been working closely with DoD leaders and we all expected a different response from DoD."


NYPD's Bratton Took Joint Away From Woman Smoking Pot on Street
New York Police Department Commissioner William Bratton said he stopped a woman smoking pot on a Manhattan street as she headed to class Thursday morning.
Mr. Bratton and a member of his security detail were walking on Wall Street when they caught the scent of burning marijuana in the air, he told an audience at New York Law School.
Moments later, they came face-to-face with the woman, joint in hand.
"Directly in front of me is this young woman happily puffing away. She's got her earphones in and her school bag," said Mr. Bratton, who told the story in response to a question about the legalization of marijuana from the advocacy group Occupy Weed Street.
The two came up on either side of her and tapped her on the shoulder, Mr. Bratton said.
"I wished I had a photograph of her face because she instantly recognized me," said Mr. Bratton.
People stopped for low-level marijuana possession in New York City are now issued tickets instead of being arrested as part of a policy change that took place in November, police said.
Under the new policy, officers are directed to issue a court summons to people found in possession of 25 grams or fewer of marijuana, officials said. The summons would essentially be like a citation for public urination—it has to be taken care of with a court appearance and potential fine but wouldn't result in an arrest, a trip to the precinct for fingerprinting or a criminal record, officials said.
But in this instance, the girl young woman was off the hook, Mr. Bratton said.
"We politely removed the marijuana and threw it into the local sewer and just suggested that she might have a better academic day without the influence," said Mr. Bratton.


Military Officer Recommends Not Jailing Bergdahl
Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl shouldn't face jail time or a punitive discharge from the military, according to a recommendation from an Army officer revealed late Friday in a filing from Sgt. Bergdahl's defense team.
The full recommendation from Lt. Col. Mark Visger hasn't yet been made public by the Army in the case of Sgt. Bergdahl, who faces desertion and other misconduct charges after he allegedly left his unit in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by insurgents.
An Army spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of Sgt. Bergdahl's legal case.
Col. Visger presided over an Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a preliminary hearing, in Sgt. Bergdahl's case last month. During that hearing, the lead military investigator in the case said he didn't believe Sgt. Bergdahl should be jailed.
Col. Visger's recommendation as the presiding officer of the Article 32 proceeding represents a setback for the Army's case against Sgt. Bergdahl.


Blood in Ankara
A pair of suicide bombings ripped through a peace rally in Ankara on Saturday morning, killing at least 95 marchers and injuring hundreds. It was the deadliest terror attack in Turkey's modern history and further evidence that a country that is supposed to be an anchor of Middle East stability is increasingly vulnerable to regional furies and its own domestic discontents.
No group had taken credit for the bombings by our deadline Sunday evening. Turkish security forces believe the attack was carried out either by Islamic State, the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or one of the country's resurgent left-wing terror outfits.
Yet members of the mainstream ethnic-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) were attending the targeted rally, which called for easing hostilities between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants. That makes the PKK an unlikely culprit. The Ankara massacre followed two other recent bombings against HDP and left-wing activists.
That leaves Islamic State. Once allowed to cross Turkey's porous border to fight in Syria, Islamic State forces have now turned against Ankara, vowing to punish the Turks for joining the "crusaders" against their self-declared caliphate. But Islamic State usually takes credit for its deadly handiwork, while Turkish security forces have a record of manipulating evidence against their preferred culprits, so we'll reserve judgment on responsibility.
What is clear is that the bombings hit at a fraught moment in Turkish politics. Turks will soon hold the second national election in less than a year. Voters in June stripped the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years, mainly out of fear of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian ambitions. The HDP entered Parliament for the first time in those elections by appealing beyond its Kurdish base.


Canada Liberals Gain Edge as Vote Nears
OTTAWA—Canada's centrist Liberal Party is gaining ground in the final days of a tight race before Monday's national election, as voter fatigue with the incumbent Conservative government is fueling support for a Liberal leader whose biggest political obstacle has been his inexperience.
In his bid to become Canada's next prime minister, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, the 43-year-old son of long-serving Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has constantly battled his rivals' charge that he is a novice. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has made it a campaign refrain to say Mr. Trudeau is "not ready" to govern, highlighting his government's 10-year track record of economic stewardship.
But with Canada's resource-heavy economy slumping, voters appear less convinced by Mr. Harper's message and more willing to embrace change. Most polls now give Mr. Trudeau a big enough lead over the incumbent Conservatives that he looks closer than Mr. Harper to leading a minority government.
Such a result would have seemed far-fetched just weeks ago. If it comes to pass, it would bring to an end almost a decade of Mr. Harper's rule.
A potential Liberal minority government's survival would rely on some kind of coalition or tacit agreement with another party to remain in power. That party would most likely be the left-leaning New Democratic Party, which at one point had the lead but has now slipped to third.


Taiwan's KMT Dumps Presidential Nominee Ahead of January Election
BEIJING—Taiwan's ruling party took the unusual step on Saturday of ousting its pro-Beiing presidential nominee less than three months before the election, reflecting pessimism about her chances amid increasing wariness of mainland China.
Of 891 delegates to the emergency meeting of the Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang or KMT, 812 voted to repeal the candidacy of Hung Hsiu-chiu, according to a statement posted on the party's website. Recent polls had shown Ms. Hung, who is known for being strongly in favor of stronger ties with mainland China, trailing far behind Democratic Progressive Party candidate Tsai Ing-wen.
The resolution passed on Saturday said Ms. Hung's candidacy had been voided "because of severe tests to the party's survival and development," according to the KMT statement. The decision scuppers what would have been the island's first all-female presidential race.
"The party can abandon me, but I won't give up on the party," Ms. Hung said in televised comments ahead of the vote Saturday afternoon.
The Kuomintang voted for Eric Chu, its chairman, to replace her on its ticket in the election set for Jan. 16, 2016.


Biden Draws Contrasts With Hillary Clinton
WASHINGTON—Vice President Joe Biden, poised to make a decision about whether to run for president, at a Tuesday appearance sought to distinguish himself as a presidential adviser without an equal, and drew subtle distinctions with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Biden used a forum honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale to explain his views on the nation's No. 2 office and to detail the central role he has played in President Barack Obama's administration. For nearly seven years, he has been the last person in the room with the president when decisions are made, spending four to seven hours a day with Mr. Obama and offering candid advice to the commander in chief, Mr. Biden said.
"I attend every meeting the president has—at his request," he said, adding that he and the president are "simpatico" on all major issues.
Mr. Biden never mentioned Mrs. Clinton by name, but appeared to be shadow boxing with her, comparing his job to that of secretary of state and saying that when he travels the world other leaders "know I am speaking for the president."
During the lead-up to her testimony on the 2012 Benghazi attacks on Capitol Hill this week, Mrs. Clinton has clashed with Republicans, accusing the GOP-led Select Committee on Benghazi of serving as a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee. By contrast, Mr. Biden cast himself as the White House's lead interlocutor Tuesday, always willing to reach across the aisle.


Civil Rights Lawyer Hired by Family of Black Man Killed by Florida Officer
The fatal roadside shooting of a black church musician by a plainclothes police officer in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., early Sunday morning has engulfed the police department in controversy, triggering plans for protests and drawing the involvement of a high-profile civil-rights lawyer.
It is the latest in a string of police killings of African-Americans, in cities such as Ferguson, Mo., and North Charleston, S.C., that have spawned a national debate over police tactics and racial profiling.
In this case, the incident began late Saturday night after Corey Jones, a drummer who played in his church and in a band called the Future Prezidents, finished a gig in Jupiter, Fla., said fellow band member Mathew Huntsberger. After leaving, Mr. Huntsberger said he received a call at about 1:45 a.m. Sunday from Mr. Jones, who said his car had broken down on a freeway exit ramp and that the oil sensor had lit up. Mr. Huntsberger said he went to meet Mr. Jones and brought him a container of oil.
When the pair still couldn't start the car, Mr. Jones called roadside assistance, Mr. Huntsberger said. "I offered him a ride, but he said he would just wait" for a tow truck, Mr. Huntsberger said.
According to the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department, Officer Nouman Raja, who was in plain clothes and in an unmarked vehicle, spotted the car on the exit ramp at about 3:15 a.m. He was on duty, working as part of a police detail responding to a string of burglaries in the city, said Chief Stephen Stepp at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.


U.S., Russia to Meet to Discuss Syria Crisis
The U.S. and Russia will meet for their first face-to-face talks on Syria since Russian warplanes began flying combat missions there at cross purposes with an American-led campaign.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart as well as top diplomats from Saudi Arabia and Turkey on Friday in Vienna as the Obama administration grasps for a way to salvage its Middle East agenda.
The meeting follows a visit to Moscow this week by Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad—his first known trip outside his country since the start of its conflict more than four years ago. It was a show of defiance to the West and a sign of Russia's effort to position itself as the essential power broker in the region.
Mr. Kerry will voice U.S. concern about Russia's airstrikes against the Assad regime's foes and what Washington sees as a need to move toward a political transition in Syria that would remove Mr. Assad from power.
However, U.S. expectations have been tempered by Russia's military campaign.


TPP Is Surprising Vote of Confidence in Globalization
Globalization has looked pretty sickly of late. Immigration, multinational companies and free trade are under fire from populists on both the left and right in Europe and the U.S. Trade activity is stagnant, with total exports and imports recently growing more slowly than global output.
This makes it all the more remarkable that 12 countries just agreed to unprecedented new rules governing both domestic and international trade policies in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Even more remarkable is the broad political support TPP enjoys in most of those countries.
To cite one example: Canada's centrist Liberal party fought a losing battle in 1988 to stop a free-trade agreement negotiated with the U.S. by the then-governing Conservative party. This week, the Liberals won an election while largely supporting the TPP that the losing Conservatives negotiated. The left-wing New Democratic Party, which campaigned against TPP, finished a distant third.
This suggests that among governing parties at least, support for the expansive American model of free trade—rather than China's narrower variant—remains intact. It is thus ironic that the one country where passage looks precarious is the U.S.
TPP would be the U.S.'s first major multilateral trade agreement in more than 20 years. Free trade has become a harder slog as trade itself has evolved. In the decades after signing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, countries cut tariffs and quotas primarily on manufactured goods. (Agriculture largely remained restricted.) As barriers to goods fell away, the focus shifted to services, intellectual property, foreign investment and government procurement.

France
Bus Crash Kills at Least 43 People
A collision between a cargo truck and a bus Friday morningleft at least 43 people dead and several seriously injured, in France's worst traffic accident in decades.
A bus carrying elderly passengers along a country road in southwestern France collided with a truck at 7:30 a.m. local time, authorities said, causing the vehicles to burst into flames.
TV images of the accident showed smoke rising from the charred shells of the two vehicles.
A truck and its trailer appeared in the opposite lane of traffic, where it was apparently struck by the oncoming bus.
The dead included the truck driver and his 3-year-old son, French authorities said. It wasn't clear whether 41 or 42 people died in the bus.


The Decline of ObamaCare
ObamaCare's image of invincibility is increasingly being exposed as a political illusion, at least for those with permission to be honest about the evidence. Witness the heretofore unknown phenomenon of a "free" entitlement that its beneficiaries can't afford or don't want.
This month the Health and Human Services Department dramatically discounted its internal estimate of how many people will join the state insurance exchanges in 2016. There are about 9.1 million enrollees today, and the consensus estimate—by the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicare actuary and independent analysts like Rand Corp.—was that participation would surge to some 20 million. But HHS now expects enrollment to grow to between merely 9.4 million and 11.4 million.
Recruitment for 2015 is roughly 70% of the original projection, but ObamaCare will be running at less than half its goal in 2016. HHS believes some 19 million Americans earn too much for Medicaid but qualify for ObamaCare subsidies and haven't signed up. Some 8.5 million of that 19 million purchase off-exchange private coverage with their own money, while the other 10.5 million are still uninsured. In other words, for every person who's allowed to join and has, two people haven't.
Among this population of the uninsured, HHS reports that half are between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly two-thirds are in excellent or very good health. The exchanges won't survive actuarially unless they attract this prime demographic: ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty and social-justice redistribution are supposed to force these low-cost consumers to buy overpriced policies to cross-subsidize everybody else. No wonder HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said meeting even the downgraded target is "probably pretty challenging."
The HHS survey shows three of four ObamaCare-eligible uninsured people think having coverage is important—but four of five say they couldn't fit their share of the premiums into their budgets even after the subsidies. They're not poor; they tend to have jobs in industries like construction, retail and hospitality but feel insecure financially; and they prioritize items like paying down debt, car repairs or saving to buy a home over insurance.

Old Drug May Offer New Fix for Malaria
A drug used widely for years to treat tropical diseases may also help stop malaria from spreading, potentially offering a powerful new tool in the fight to eradicate one of the world's leading killers, according to preliminary new research.
Two studies presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Philadelphia point to signs that ivermectin can either kill malaria-transmitting mosquitoes when they feed on the blood of humans who have taken the drug, or prevent the mosquitoes from transmitting the malaria parasite to humans, by interfering with their digestive systems.
Ivermectin, a workhorse antiparasitic drug, is used to treat lymphatic filariasis, which causes elephantiasis, and onchocerciasis, which causes river blindness.
The idea of using ivermectin to help break the cycle of transmission comes as development of new tools to fight malaria is accelerating.

Dynamic Airways Jet Catches Fire in Florida
DANIA BEACH, Fla.—A jet plane's engine caught fire Thursday as it prepared for takeoff, and more than 100 passengers had to quickly evacuate using emergency slides, One person was seriously injured, officials said.
Dozens of passengers could be seen in video footage gliding down the slides of the Dynamic Airways flight bound for Caracas, Venezuela. Some ran away from the plane into the terminal at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport as fire crews rushed to put the blaze out.
Andres Gallegos said he was one of the first passengers to use the chutes to evacuate.
"I heard a loud bang. I turned around, saw the lights, saw the flames and I ran to the front of the aircraft," said Mr. Gallegos, who said it took about 30 seconds for the plane doors to open. "It was pretty nerve-racking, knowing that the door wasn't opening and that something was on fire."
Other passengers reported chaos as people screamed, cried and ran through the plane. Several people said the flight crew remained calm and acted quickly.


Netanyahu Retracts Claim About Palestinian Link to Holocaust
TEL AVIV—Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday retracted his claim that a Palestinian cleric persuaded Adolf Hitler to exterminate the Jews, following widespread criticism of the comments and accusations that the Israeli leader was stoking tensions amid weeks of violence.
More than a week after Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini told Hitler to "burn" the Jews of Europe rather than deport them, the Israeli leader walked back his comments.
Mr. Netanyahu, who had already tried to clarify his remarks following a broadside of criticism from historians and Israeli and Palestinian officials, said the mufti supported the mass murder of the Jews during World War II, what was known as the Final Solution, but that the Nazis instigated the plan.
"The decision to move from a policy of deporting Jews to the Final Solution was made by the Nazis and was not dependent on outside influence," Mr. Netanyahu wrote in a post on his Facebook page, an unusual medium to respond to such criticism.
"The Nazis saw in the Mufti a collaborator, but they did not need him to decide on the systematic destruction of European Jewry," he added in the post, which was in English and Hebrew.


Seoul, Tokyo Pledge to Resolve 'Comfort Women' Dispute
SEOUL—The leaders of Japan and South Korea pushed for a quick resolution to a long-standing dispute over the tens of thousands of Korean and other women in World War II who were made to serve as prostitutes for Japanese troops.
"The two countries agreed to accelerate the talks [over so-called comfort women] and aim to reach an agreement as early as possible," Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday after his 100-minute conversation with South Korean President Park Geun-hye at her Blue House presidential office, in their first summit in three years.
Anger in South Korea over comfort women has strained relations between the large economic partners, with Seoul viewing Tokyo's past apologies as insufficient.
Ms. Park refrained from saying that the dispute would be resolved quickly, but her comments suggested she would work to reach an agreement within the next two months, before the end of this year's anniversary marking diplomatic normalization in 1965.
"We should make this year, the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship, a turning point for advancing toward the future," she said.


Government Land Grab
The Obama Administration has spent years invading broad parts of the economy from finance to health care, but less noticed is the takeover of, well, actual land. Witness the standoff over a 50-year-old public land program that has devolved into a watering hole for seizing private property.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund, whose Congressional authorization expired on Sept. 30, has since 1965 shelled out more than $16 billion for preserving natural resources and providing "recreation opportunities to all Americans." Taxing oil and gas leases feeds the fund's land acquisition program and a state initiative that offers grants for community projects—baseball diamonds, playgrounds and the like.
The fund originally set aside six of every $10 for state priorities, but last year more than 80% of the cash helped the feds buy acreage. Keep in mind that the government already owns roughly 30% of the U.S., including 80% of Nevada and nearly 70% of Utah. The 635 million acre portfolio is so immense that less than 15% of National Forest boundaries are even surveyed and marked. The state program, on the other hand, received $48 million of 2014's $306 million pot, which is better than the nothing states have reaped in some previous years.
The federal PacMan hopes to gobble up more than 160 plots in 2015, yet the government can't manage what it already controls. The Interior Department has estimated $20 billion in deferred maintenance among land-management agencies, no surprise to anyone who has fled a public bathroom in Yosemite. Nine in 10 miles of National Park Service roads are crumbling, along with structurally deficient bridges and some 6,700 miles of dirt described as trails in bad shape. Yellowstone's tab alone exceeds $650 million.
Environmental outfits are howling for the fund's renewal, and they're defending a revenue source. Green groups purchase land the feds have been eyeing and then hawk it to the government at a premium. Another abuse: At least 19 states channel Donald Trump and deploy the funds for eminent-domain projects.


WSJ/NBC Poll Finds Anger at Political System
Amy West, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher, traces her frustration with the rest of the country to a local fight banning prayer at area schools more than a decade ago. "I have to have the Bible in my life," she said.
A Republican from Vilonia, Ark., she plans to support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in next year's GOP presidential primary. She thinks he is best equipped to tackle her concerns, starting with the dwindling influence of religion in Americans' daily lives.
Republican primary voters are overwhelmingly unsettled by societal changes transforming the country, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, while Democratic primary voters describe themselves as proud that the country has moved further to protect the rights of minority groups and to accept gay marriage.
The results show that, in many ways, Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are being forced to tailor their messages for deeply disparate groups. If there is a unifying theme, it is anger at the political system, the Journal/NBC News poll suggests.
Some 71% of GOP primary voters agreed when asked whether they felt "out of place" in their own country and uneasy about widespread illegal immigration, the shrinking role of religion in public life and the growing acceptance of gay and lesbian rights. Among these GOP voters, 45% strongly agreed with that view, compared with just 12% among Democratic primary voters.


White House Says It Plans to Complete Keystone XL Review
WASHINGTON—The White House on Tuesday said it wants to continue with the review of the Keystone XL pipeline, even though the company behind the project requested that the review be suspended.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the request to withdraw the permit was "unusual," and that the plan was to let the State Department review process play out and allow President Barack Obama make a final decision on the pipeline before he leaves office in 2017.
The company, TransCanada Corp. , was looking to build a cross-border pipeline that would enable oil to be moved from Canada to the Gulf Coast. The company has been pursuing a cross-border permit since 2008. On Monday, it asked the State Department to put the review process on hold while it undergoes a state review in Nebraska—a move that would essentially delay a final decision on the pipeline until after the 2016 elections.
Mr. Obama has expressed skepticism about the project, and a rejection of the pipeline by the State Department was widely expected. A delay could punt the approval to the next presidential administration. All Republican presidential candidates say they support the project, and all Democratic hopefuls oppose it.
The pipeline would span 1,700 miles across six states and move as many as 830,000 barrels of oil a day, mostly from Canada's oil sands to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines to Gulf Coast refineries.


The ObamaCare Albatross
The Democratic Party has prospered for decades by promising voters entitlements in return for Election Day loyalty. It worked with Social Security and Medicare, and so it was supposed to work for ObamaCare: Pass it and they will come. Instead the Affordable Care Act has become a recurring political catastrophe for Democrats, most recently on Tuesday in Kentucky.
The GOP picked up the Kentucky governorship for only the second time in 44 years as businessman Matt Bevin hung President Obama's signature domestic achievement around Bluegrass State Democrats. Mr. Bevin trailed Attorney General Jack Conway in the polls for most of the campaign, but a late surge produced a GOP rout.
Mr. Bevin won 53%-44% and swept 107 of Kentucky's 120 counties—including a few liberal strongholds. Republicans had held one statewide office; after the election they'll hold four of six. Mr. Bevin's running mate, business executive and Air Force vet Jenean Hampton, became the first African-American to win a statewide race.
Democrats blamed the drubbing on low turnout and "Trump-mania"—a swipe at Mr. Bevin's Tea Party roots. But before the election they were saying that Mr. Bevin, who tends to shoot from the lip, was unelectable. He might have been—if not for ObamaCare.
The national press had made Kentucky a showcase of the Affordable Care Act, touting Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's state-run exchange, KYnect, and his Medicaid expansion. The local results weren't so cheery. Two-fifths of Kentucky hospitals have had to cut services due to soaring Medicaid costs.


Syrian Government Forces Regain Key Aleppo Supply Route
BEIRUT—Syrian regime forces reopened an important supply line to the northern city of Aleppo, nearly two weeks after Islamic State seized a section of the road and effectively closed off access to regime-held parts of the city.
Civilian and commercial traffic resumed Thursday morning on the Khanaser road, according to state media, activists and local residents, after regime and allied forces including Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah militias regained control of the road Wednesday following a dayslong battle against the extremists.
State media reported that the Syrian army had cleared Islamic State-planted explosives from the road, which links the western half of Aleppo to other areas under the control of President Bashar al-Assad.
Islamic State militants have been advancing west on Aleppo from the eastern countryside.
Their capture in October of a checkpoint on the road blocked the city from commercial deliveries of produce, milk, sugar and fuel, residents said, leading to shortages and price increases that tested its citizens, who were already struggling after four years of conflict.


Obama's Middle East Escapism
Secretary of State John Kerry's new diplomatic process for dealing with Syria's harrowing civil war involves convening a series of talks in Vienna. The effort is probably well-intentioned. But I cannot conceive of what he expects to accomplish.
Does anyone really believe that Syria can be put back together again and then revived through democratic elections? The danger is that the all-purpose diplomatic resort to "process" will lead the United States to ignore realities and even make them worse.
America faces two interconnected perils in the region: the expansion of Islamic State and the breakdown of the Middle East's century-old security order. The Obama administration's fear of involvement and denial of the fundamental struggle for dominance in the region increases the risks for the U.S., Europe, Africa and Asia. The conference in Vienna last week—involving at least a dozen interested parties, including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia—was escapism, not a serious strategy. The next gathering in a week or so will be more of the same.
The old state borders and authorities of the Middle East, established during and after World War I, are disintegrating. The Arab lands are now the scene of a terrible contest for power. As former U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus explained to Congress in September, "almost every Middle Eastern country is now a battleground or a combatant in one or more wars."
The antagonists recognize that the stakes are for nothing less than control of this crossroads for Asia, Europe and Africa. It is the home of three of the world's major religions, the world's primary source of energy, a cradle of civilizations and graveyard of armies and empires—and is now the scene of possible nuclear-weapons proliferation.


A Vote on Taxes—or a Tax Cut
Direct democracy has its uses, especially against a self-interested legislature. Washington state voters this week appear to have approved an initiative to cut the state sales tax if lawmakers don't allow a vote on a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority for a tax increase.
Washington is a vote-by-mail state, but the initiative spearheaded by tax activist Tim Eyman was leading with nearly 53% of the vote on Thursday. Washington is one of nine U.S. states without an income tax, and voters have made clear they want the authority to amend their state constitution to require a supermajority to approve a tax increase. They have cause to worry. Over two decades Washington voters have repeatedly approved ballot measures requiring a two-thirds majority for any tax hike. But the legislators would simply pass new legislation to throw out the two-thirds requirement, and get on with raising taxes.
Even without an income tax, legislators managed to raise other taxes by $9 billion in 2005. After they repealed the next two-thirds requirement in 2010, they raised taxes $6.7 billion. In 2015 the tax hikes totaled $17.5 billion.
In 2013 the state Supreme Court struck down the two-thirds requirement by initiative on grounds that the state constitution specifies that only a simple majority is required to pass most legislation. If tax activists didn't like it, they would have to amend the state constitution.
So that's what they're now doing. Constitutional amendments have to be first approved by a two-thirds majority of lawmakers, so initiative sponsors engaged in a bit of derring-do at the ballot box. The initiative specifies it will lower the state sales tax to 5.5% from 6.5% (a major revenue cut) unless the legislature puts a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority for tax increases on the ballot. In other words: Let us vote or we cut your allowance.


Former NYPD Commissioner Kelly Joins K2 Intelligence
Nearly two years after he left his job atop the New York Police Department, Raymond Kelly said he doesn't miss it.
"It's refreshing, really, to be out," he said in an interview last week. "Not having that burden, or obligation, on your shoulders, I feel free—or freer."
Now Mr. Kelly, 74 years old, is joining other former government officials at the corporate-investigations firm K2 Intelligence, where on Monday he was named vice chairman, helping with strategy, crisis management and counseling executives, he said.
Mr. Kelly served as police commissioner for two New York City mayors: David Dinkins from 1992 to 1993, and Michael Bloomberg from 2002 to 2013. His new job comes about a year and a half after he was tapped to lead a new risk-management unit for commercial real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.
At K2 Intelligence, which has offices in New York City and around the world, Mr. Kelly's experience managing terror risks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks will be harnessed for the private sector, said Jeremy Kroll, the firm's chief executive.


Portugal Goes to Greece?
Portuguese politics could tip into disarray Tuesday if a coalition of left-wing parties pledging a Keynesian spending spree unseats the center-right government. If you thought this year's Greek crisis was entertaining, you might be in for a rerun.
Voters handed a sort-of victory to Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in Oct. 4's parliamentary poll. His Portugal Forward coalition, with 38% of the vote, was the largest vote-getter, but his center-right coalition controls only 107 of 230 parliamentary seats in a minority government.
Now the Left Bloc and Communist parties, which between them control 34 seats, have sniffed an opportunity, as have some members on the leftward end of the Socialist party, the main opposition bloc. Socialist leader Antonio Costa, who had previously ruled out such a coalition, relented this weekend and now is expected to join a no-confidence vote Tuesday to unseat Mr. Coelho.
The agreements reached over the weekend call for reversing all government-employee salary cuts mandated by the bailout deal; boosting welfare spending and raising the minimum wage; halting planned cuts to the corporate tax rate; and the renationalization of some companies that were privatized in recent years. The left claims the spending will pay for itself by boosting growth, but these were precisely the policies the led Portugal to crisis in the first place.
This realignment is possible because Mr. Coelho wasn't able to build a popular mandate behind his pledge to push forward with bailout-style policies now that Portugal has formally emerged from its European Union bailout program. Voters have suffered the bailout's tax hikes while deeper liberalization remains a work in progress, even if the economy is at least growing again.


Republican Candidates Push Bold Tax Plans
Republican presidential candidates are competing to propose dramatic changes to tax policy that go well beyond the party's previous platforms and all but ensure the issue will play a central role in the general election.
Driven by a desire to stand out in a crowded field and spark economic growth, the GOP contenders no longer just say they want to lower rates and expand the tax base. Their new ideas, once the province of right-leaning think tanks, make previous Republican plans look timid.
Nearly all the GOP candidates—who will meet again Tuesday evening in a debate hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal—are promoting at least one tax idea the party hasn't tried to sell to a general-election audience.
Among them: eliminating both payroll and corporate taxes and introducing a broader business tax in their place. Donald Trump, a front-runner, has proposed a tax cut that by one estimate would put federal collections at their lowest since World War II.
"It doesn't seem like there's anything constraining these guys," said Alex Brill, a former GOP congressional tax staffer now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "The next guy that's announcing his plan, he's going to announce a plan that's bigger and bolder and better than the last guy. And then he can win that debate."


In Skelos Case, Sticking Point Is Personal Details
With the corruption trial of New York state Sen. Dean Skelos and his son, Adam, set to begin next week, the potential disclosure of personal information about Adam Skelos remained a point of contention between attorneys for the men and federal prosecutors at a hearing Friday.
The men are charged in a wide-ranging scheme to use the Long Island Republican lawmaker's political power to secure payments for his son from businesses with legislative and business interests with New York. Both have pleaded not guilty.
The trial is expected to begin Monday in Manhattan federal court.
The defense has indicated in court appearances and filings that it hopes to elicit information from witnesses that would show people helped Adam Skelos because they knew certain details about his life, not because his father was exerting his influence.
But prosecutors expressed concern about information that might emerge in the cross-examination of at least one of their witnesses: Adam Skelos's supervisor at a medical-malpractice insurer. The insurer depended on state funding, and its chief executive was a longtime associate of the senator.


France Tried to Ramp Up Defenses
PARIS—The attacks Friday night in Paris confirmed what French security services have feared for months: that the country would be targeted by another devastating attack like the deadly spree that left 17 dead in Paris in January.
In the 11 months since a trio of gunmen shook the city with that series of shootings, the French government has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sensitive targets and repeatedly boosted its surveillance powers to protect itself.
But Friday's shootings and explosions across Paris illustrate the difficulty authorities in France and elsewhere face in containing a diffuse but deadly terror threat.
They also underscore the security challenge France will face when a global summit on climate change begins at the end of the month. The government this week decided to restore border checks during the summit, the first time it has taken that step in years. Over 100 world leaders are expected to attend the opening of the summit.
Authorities have recently been on higher alert because of what they believed to be new efforts by extremists in Syria to carry out attacks back in Europe. Those fears, French officials said, were a key reason why France decided in September to bomb Islamic State positions in Syria.


Doctors Could be Penalized for Ordering Prostate Tests
Medicare officials are considering a measure that would penalize doctors who order routine prostate-cancer screening tests for their patients, as part of a federal effort to define and reward quality in health-care services.
The proposal, which hasn't been widely publicized, has prompted a flurry of last-minute comments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, including more than 200 in the past two days, virtually all in opposition. The official comment period began Oct. 26 and ends Friday.
Many of those commenting said the measure would discourage doctors from discussing the pros and cons of screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with their patients and allowing them to decide, as several major medical groups recommend.
"PSA screening is a very controversial topic. The debate is ongoing and people feel very strongly about it, one way or another," said David Penson, chair of public policy and practice support for the American Urological Association, which urged CMS to reject the proposal. "To make it a quality measure would say, 'You're a poor quality doctor if your patients get this test.' "
The proposed measure is part of continuing federal efforts to develop ways to identify and reward value in health care. The Obama administration has said it plans to tie 50% of Medicare payments to such quality measures by 2018.


U.S. Citizen Among Dead in Mali Attacks
WASHINGTON -- The State Department identified the American killed in Mali on Friday as Anita Ashok Datar.
Ms. Datar was born in western Massachusetts and was a senior manager at Palladium, an international strategy and development consulting group. She is survived by her son, mother, father and brother.
In a statement, her family said they were devastated by her loss.
"Anita was one of the kindest and most generous people we know," the statement said. "Everything she did in her life she did to help others—as a mother, public health expert, daughter, sister and friend."
They added: "While we are angry and saddened that she has been killed, we know that she would want to promote education and health care to prevent violence and poverty at home and abroad, not intolerance."


Obama Seeks to Humanize Refugee Crisis
KUALA LUMPUR—President Barack Obama sought to humanize a global crisis that has become a political battle as he met Saturday with young refugees and vowed to ensure that the U.S. would remain a welcoming place for those fleeing violence and discrimination.
Saying that the children and teenage refugees he spoke with in Kuala Lumpur "represent the opposite of terrorism," Mr. Obama called for the U.S. to protect and support those who have endured extraordinary hardships.
"When we talk about American leadership, American leadership is us caring about people who have been forgotten, or who have been discriminated against, or who have been tortured, or who have been subject to unspeakable violence, or have been separated from families at very young ages," Mr. Obama during a visit to a center that provides assistance to many refugee families. "That's American leadership..not when we respond on the basis of fear."
Mr. Obama's meeting with refugees from Myanmar, Sudan and Somalia came amid a bitter political fight back home about whether the U.S. should halt or delay the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Earlier this week, House Republicans and nearly four dozen Democrats passed a bill that would drastically tighten screening procedures for Syrians seeking refuge in the U.S.
Mr. Obama, who is in Malaysia for a pair of regional summits, had long planned to visit the Dignity for Children Foundation in Kuala Lumpur. But in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, the refugee issue has taken on an added sense of urgency.


Police Investigate New Orleans Shooting
Police on Monday sought to determine what touched off a wild shootout in a crowd of people at a New Orleans park, where an evening of fun at a block party swiftly turned into a nightmare.
The shootout, combined with the recent shooting of a good Samaritan who tried to help a woman who was being dragged toward a vehicle, put a city that has long struggled with violence on edge.
"No one feels safe," said Peter Scharf, a Louisiana State University professor who studies crime.
The Sunday night shootout happened as hundreds of people — possibly as many as 500 — gathered at the Bunny Friend Playground in what police described as a block party. A music video was also being filmed there. Police said neither event had a permit.
Officers were nearby overseeing a neighborhood parade when they received reports of a large crowd at the park. The shooting happened while they were on their way to disperse the gathering. Two groups pulled out weapons and started firing, police said.


GOP Rivals Split on How to Fight Terror
The Paris terror attacks have crystallized a divide in the Republican presidential field over the scope of American intelligence gathering and whether to establish a no-fly zone over Syria.
The carnage in Paris, coupled with the downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt and the attack on a hotel in Mali, has amplified security concerns in the U.S., prompting many White House hopefuls in recent days to spell out how they would combat Islamic State.
On the Republican side, the most aggressive—including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio—want to keep alive a controversial data-collection program run by the National Security Agency that Congress effectively ended this year.
"Let's face it: Paris is going to prove out to be, in my opinion, in the long run, an intelligence failure," Mr. Christie said Tuesday during an appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations. "You had people from multiple countries, a synchronized attack. They didn't get together at the Taco Bell 15 minutes before and put this thing together."
The debate over combating terrorism provides a rare opportunity for GOP primary voters to measure the candidates based on their clear differences on a specific issue.


Conservatives Reach Out to Latinos Ahead of 2016 Elections
MESA, Ariz.— In an office building in this Phoenix suburb, an activist group is helping more than 100 Hispanic immigrants to learn English.
But it isn't one of the usual left-leaning organizations involved in grass-roots Latino advocacy—it is the Libre Initiative, a group funded by the conservative donor network founded by Charles and David Koch.
Active in nine states, including Colorado, Nevada and Virginia, Libre, which means free in Spanish, is an effort to organize Latinos around free-market political ideas.
By offering recent immigrants practical services such as English-language courses, tax-preparation seminars and driver's license classes—while peppering them with conservative political messages—organizers believe they can circumvent traditional gatekeepers to Latino voters that tend to favor Democrats.
"We seek to advance free-market principles and free the private sector," said Libre founder Daniel Garza, who served as an associate director in the Office of Public Liaison in George W. Bush's White House. "It is very much a policy-driven conversation that we are having with Latino communities across the country."


Russian Defense Industry Hits Speed Bumps
NIZHNIY TAGIL, Russia—The Russian military has shown off its new fighting power during its airstrikes in Syria, releasing slick videos of cruise-missile launches and satellite-guided bombs hitting their targets.
But at the same time, parts of the military-industrial complex at home are faltering. Russia's economy has been hit hard by plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, and some of its biggest arms makers fear dwindling government support.
The Armata tank, produced in a town in the Urals, is a case in point. The next-generation tank—designed to beat anything the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has on the battlefield—is considered a centerpiece of Russia's $300 billion plan to rearm its military by 2020.
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the factory in 2012 and again this week to give it a personal endorsement. Last year, however, the Armata became an object of rare public criticism as it ran behind schedule and over budget. Now the military is slashing its initial orders.
"The government can't pay for everything. These are new times, because of the fall in oil prices," military analyst Alexander Golts said.


Putin Snubs Overtures From Erdogan Over Downed Warplane
The standoff between Russia and Turkey intensified on Friday, as the Kremlin snubbed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's calls for dialogue and reiterated demands that Turkey apologize after its forces downed a Russian Su-24 bomber on the Syrian border.
Russia's unforgiving response to the Nov. 24 incident—the first time a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member has shot down a Russian warplane since 1952—has plunged relations between Moscow and Ankara into uncharted territory.
It also sets up an unprecedented conflict between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr. Erdogan, two strongmen known for their steely resolve, who despite years of partnership have now split on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict.
Mr. Putin is demanding Turkey apologize, as the Russian government presses ahead with plans to sanction Turkish trade and economic interests, suspend visa-free travel and stem the flow of Russian tourists who travel to Turkey's beaches each year by the millions.
But so far Mr. Erdogan hasn't budged. He described Turkey's decision to shoot down the warplane as a necessary defense of Turkish borders and said Moscow had blown the incident out of proportion. Mr. Erdogan called for dialogue but hasn't apologized.


Islamic State Lured Son of Jordan's Elite
AMMAN, Jordan—In January, Mohammad Dalaeen joined his parliamentarian father in a protest against Islamic State after the militants captured a childhood acquaintance who became a Jordanian fighter pilot.
Nine months later, the 23-year-old carried out a suicide bombing for the extremist group.
Mr. Dalaeen's transformation from a promising medical student to Islamic State fighter underscores the challenges for the pro-Western Jordanian monarchy in stopping young men from crossing the borders to join extremist groups in neighboring Syria and Iraq.
For many Jordanian families whose sons have quietly slipped away, the journey to jihad, or holy war, has become a frequent and painfully perplexing problem.
Young Jordanian men have become reliable recruits for extremist groups owing to the small country's proximity to the battlefields. High poverty rates and constraints on political expression have also compelled some to leave, according to Hassan Abu Hanieh, an independent researcher and expert on Islamist groups.


Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Vote Limited to Native Hawaiians
WASHINGTON—A closely divided Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily blocked Hawaii from counting votes in an election open only to descendants of its indigenous people, who were selecting delegates to an assembly that would propose greater self-government for Native Hawaiians.
Several Hawaii residents who object to the process sued to cancel the election, contending the state has applied an unconstitutional racial test for voting, among other claims. The state argued the election wasn't an official act at all, because a private nonprofit, Na'i Aupuni, formally is conducting it with grant funds provided by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
Lower courts wouldn't halt the election while the lawsuit proceeds, but the Supreme Court saw the matter differently. The high court forbade the counting of ballots or certification of winners until a "final disposition of the appeal" by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco.
The brief order said liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan would have permitted the election to proceed, but provided no other details.
The election, conducted by mail, was to conclude with a Dec. 1 vote count. On Friday, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who oversees Hawaii and other states in the Ninth Circuit, blocked the vote count, a decision the full court extended Wednesday.


Faculty, Students Call for Calmer Tone in Campus Protests
Weary from more than a month of demonstrations, accusations of bigotry and calls for "safe spaces" protected from offensive opinions, some college students and faculty are calling for calmer discussions and careful decisions in response to issues raised by protesters.
The requests come as colleges are swept up in one of the largest protest movements in decades. Sparked by frustration over the treatment of minority students, groups at the University of Missouri, Amherst College, Claremont McKenna College and dozens of other schools have called on their institutions to remove references to controversial historical figures, fire administrators and institute mandatory cultural-sensitivity training for classmates and teachers.
On Tuesday, a Harvard University dean said heads of its undergraduate residential houses no longer would use the title of "master," while Harvard Law School this week said it would review the use of its seal, which includes the family crest of a benefactor whose family owned and brutalized slaves.
But A. Douglas Stone, an applied physics professor at Yale University, wrote an open letter this week expressing support for "freedom of intellectual expression" and denying that a colleague's email about Halloween costumes was racist.
The email, which Yale lecturer Erika Christakis sent to students shortly before Halloween, challenged a message from Yale's Intercultural Affairs Council that had urged students to avoid blackface, feathered headdresses or other costumes that might offend. The email questioned whether it was beneficial for administrators to try to influence students' self-expression.


On the Front Line Against Islamic State
Dohuk Province, Iraq
Kurdish intelligence chief Masrour Barzani's forward base on the Iraqi-Syrian border isn't easy to reach. On a bright Sunday morning, two members of his staff drive me there from Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. We race four hours around Kurdistan's barren hills, passing numerous checkpoints, a circuitous route that avoids the tentacular territory that Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has carved out of Iraq and Syria.
It is late November, and the Kurds have just severed one of those ISIS tentacles by capturing Sinjar, 15 months after the jihadist army overran the Iraqi city and forced Kurdish Peshmerga forces to beat a hasty retreat. The Kurds' comeback at Sinjar means the main highway linking ISIS-controlled Mosul, Iraq, and the so-called caliphate's capital in Raqqa, Syria, is now cut off.
Security is tight at the base. Mr. Barzani, who heads the Security Council of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, is dressed in fatigues, with a pistol at his waist. We sit in a trailer that serves as a conference room. A portrait of Kurdish-nationalist hero Mustafa Barzani—Mr. Barzani's grandfather; his father is KRG President Masoud Barzani—hangs above opulent furniture with golden, rococo details that look oddly out of place. Liberated Sinjar lies 40 miles southwest. A little beyond it is an ISIS front that stretches for 650 miles.
"The Kurds have broken the myth of ISIS," says Mr. Barzani, who speaks English fluently. Including Sinjar, Peshmerga forces have retaken 7,700 square miles of territory and nearly double that if you count the successes of Syrian Kurds across the border. The Kurds' front-line efforts combined with coalition airstrikes, Mr. Barzani says, have removed about 20,000 ISIS fighters from the battlefield.


Notable & Quotable: Hilary Benn on ISIS
From a speech by Hilary Benn, the Labour Party's shadow foreign secretary, before the British House of Commons voted on Dec. 2 to support airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria:
Now Mr Speaker, no one in this debate doubts the deadly serious threat we face from Daesh and what they do, although sometimes we find it hard to live with the reality. We know that in June four gay men were thrown off the fifth story of a building in the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor. We know that in August the 82-year-old guardian of the antiquities of Palmyra, Professor Khaled al-Assad, was beheaded, and his headless body was hung from a traffic light. And we know that in recent weeks there has been the discovery of mass graves in Sinjar, one said to contain the bodies of older Yazidi women murdered by Daesh because they were judged too old to be sold for sex . . .
It has been argued in the debate that airstrikes achieve nothing. Not so. Look at how Daesh's forward march has been halted in Iraq. . . . Look at how their military capacity and their freedom of movement has been put under pressure. Ask the Kurds about Sinjar and Kobani. Now of course, air strikes alone will not defeat Daesh—but they make a difference. Because they are giving them a hard time—and it is making it more difficult for them to expand their territory. . . .
Now, Mr Speaker, I hope the house will bear with me if I direct my closing remarks to my Labour friends and colleagues on this side of the House. As a party we have always been defined by our internationalism. We believe we have a responsibility one to another. We never have—and we never should—walk by on the other side of the road.


Political Prisoners Top Venezuelan Victor's Agenda
CARACAS, Venezuela—The decisive victory of Venezuela's opposition coalition in legislative elections Sunday will lead a new congress to try to quickly pass an amnesty law for dozens of political prisoners, opposition leaders said on Monday.
Human-rights groups say there are about 80 political prisoners in Venezuela. Many were arrested during waves of student-led protests last year in which the government initially detained about 3,500 people.
The best-known case involves Leopoldo López, a top opposition leader whose popularity here has soared during his 22 months in jail, making him a potent adversary of the government if he were to be released. Mr. López was sentenced in September to nearly 14 years in prison for criminal conspiracy and inciting violence, a ruling that provoked outrage here and sharp criticism from Washington and the European Union. The government prosecutor in the case later fled to Miami and said phony evidence was used to convict him.
Since the election, Julio Borges, the leader of the First Justice opposition party, and former opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said passing an amnesty law would be among the top priorities for the new legislature.
Mr. Capriles suggested that President Nicolás Maduro should make the first move in the wake of Sunday's humiliating results for his United Socialist Party.


Atlantic City's Guardian Wakes Up Happy, Despite Turmoil
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J--The mayor of this seaside resort wakes up mornings in a spacious condo, puts on one of his 44 bow ties, then tries to convince skeptics that his city isn't just a gambler's bad hand.
Don Guardian is nearing the end of his second year of overseeing one of the country's most financially distressed cities. The honeymoon after his November 2013 victory was short.
Four of the city's 12 casinos closed last year. Property values dropped, and city casinos filed $200 million in successful property-tax appeals. More than 8,000 area workers lost their jobs and one in every 113 housing units in Atlantic County has fallen into foreclosure, the highest rate in the nation.
Mr. Guardian, an openly gay Republican, said the city's budget and payroll ballooned to unsustainable levels while gambling revenue soared in the 1990s. But he threw no pity party.
The jolly, bike-riding mayor instead performed what he called an administrative "root canal." He reduced the city's workforce to about 900 from about 1,255 through a combination of layoffs and attrition, and slashed $25 million out of the city's budget, now at $262 million. Unions protested the cuts and challenged them in courts, but the mayor prevailed.


Turkish Military Convoy Leaves Iraq Base
Turkey pulled a small military convoy out of a training base in northern Iraq that has become a new flash point as regional powers exert their influence, but refused to buckle to increasing pressure from Baghdad and Moscow to remove all its troops.
About 10 Turkish military vehicles left the camp early Monday, Turkish and Iraqi officials said, and they are moving to another base in northern Iraq. While Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the move was meant to address Baghdad's concerns, he added that Ankara had no plans to leave the disputed base.
It did little to assuage Iraqi officials who see Ankara's presence as an illegal incursion. "Redeployment is not withdrawal," said Iskander Witwit, a member of Iraq's parliament who sits on the defense and security committee.
But U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Mr. Davutoglu to praise the decision as a positive move to help defuse tensions.
"The vice president encouraged the Turkish government to continue its dialogue with Baghdad on additional measures to improve relations between Turkey and Iraq," the White House said of the call.


U.S. Says Airstrike Killed Iraqi Troops by Accident
A deadly airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State this week hit Iraqi forces by accident, Defense Secretary Ash Carter assured Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Saturday.
Iraqi Brigadier Saad Maan said nine soldiers and one officer died as a result of the strike, which targeted Islamic State positions near the extremist-held city of Fallujah, about 30 miles west of Baghdad, on Friday.
Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the coalition in Iraq, on Friday said the ministry's claim that the coalition conducted the airstrike was likely accurate, though he couldn't provide details on the type of aircraft or munitions involved.
The incident marks the first time the coalition has acknowledged that one of its airstrikes has hit Iraqi forces by accident during the fight against Islamic State.
"I wanted to assure Prime Minister Abadi that I was aware of this incident, that we regretted this incident," Mr. Carter told reporters traveling with him on a Navy warship in the Persian Gulf, after speaking with Mr. Abadi by phone. "This is the kind of thing that can happen on a dynamic battlefield..He and I both recognize that things like this can happen in war."


Minors in N.Y. Prisons to Be Separated From Adults
Minors serving time in New York state prisons will be housed separately from adult prisoners under an executive order signed Tuesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
The unilateral move to separate 16- and 17-year-old inmates from the general prison population comes months after the governor and Legislature couldn't agree on his proposed efforts to remove teenagers from the adult court system. In 2013, 837 of the 33,064 arrests of 16- and 17-year-olds resulted in state prison sentences, according to state records.
"By housing 16- and 17-year-olds in an age-appropriate correctional facility, we can offer them a better chance at turning their lives around and becoming productive members of society," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.
Under the terms of the order, a Hudson, N.Y., prison would be converted into a housing and reception center for nearly all of the state's 16- and 17-year-old inmates, who would start moving into the facility by August 2016. A separate "juvenile separation unit" would be built for short-term disciplinary confinement.
Male youth considered "maximum security" would remain housed in a juvenile unit at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility near Albany.


The Year Christmas Died
As we moved into December and what for some time has been called "the holiday season," the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at the University of Tennessee issued a "best practices" directive for the campus to "ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise."
A Christmas party in disguise? Has it come to this?
Aghast state legislators got the directive rescinded, but the Christmas killers will get the last laugh. In fact, they've already won. This is the year Christmas died as a public event in the United States.
We know this after touring the historic heart of public Christmas—Fifth Avenue in New York City.
For generations, American families have come to New York in December to swaddle themselves in the glow and spirit of Christmas—shops, restaurants, brownstones, the evergreen trees along Park Avenue, bar mirrors and, most of all, Fifth Avenue's department-store windows. You couldn't escape it, and why would you want to?


Hanoi Reverts to Repression
Vietnamese police arrested prominent legal activist Nguyen Van Dai last week when he was on his way to meet European Union representatives visiting Hanoi for a human-rights dialogue. The case is a reminder that the regime's abuse of its citizens is the main obstacle to closer ties with the West.
Mr. Dai, founder of the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam, is accused of "spreading propaganda against the state," which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years. Masked men assaulted Mr. Dai and associates days earlier, and he served four years on the same charge from 2007 to 2011 and lost his law license.
Human-rights groups estimate that Vietnam still holds more than 100 political prisoners, but politically motivated trials and convictions have declined this year. This signals that international pressure works, especially as Hanoi was seeking favorable provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other accords.
When the U.S. partially lifted an arms embargo on Vietnam in 2014, it stressed that full removal was contingent on the country's progress in human rights. But the EU failed to exercise similar influence this month when it concluded more than three years of trade negotiations without a human-rights impact assessment, as required by EU law. The EU hoped that last week's joint dialogue on human rights would provide a face-saving excuse for breaking its own rules. But Mr. Dai's arrest shows that when the international community doesn't uphold its own standards, Hanoi realizes it can get away with abuses.
With two landmark trade deals signed, the worry now is that repression is intensifying. Historically, crackdowns have spiked in the run-up to the national congress of Vietnam's Communist Party, which occurs next month. The government is also expected to pass a law further curtailing freedom of religion, a draft of which authorizes state interference in the internal affairs of religious groups.


Bratton-Kelly Clash Highlights Tricky Issue of Crime Perception
The clash over crime statistics between New York Police Commissioner William Bratton and his predecessor, Raymond Kelly, which was already startling when it began Tuesday, only deepened on Wednesday.
"Man up, provide the source. This is a former police commissioner basically dealing in tabloid politics," Mr. Bratton said in an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Wednesday.
Late Tuesday, Mr. Kelly, in comments that echoed those he made in a radio interview taped last week, said sources inside the department he once led had told him crime statistics were being underreported.
"There's concern that there's a redefining of terms that were used in the past, particularly in shootings," he said. "The citizens have a right to know what's going on in the streets."
In his TV appearance Wednesday, Mr. Bratton repeated comments he had made Tuesday: Mr. Kelly was looking to drum up sales for a new book. He added that one newspaper had suggested Mr. Kelly may be setting the stage to run for mayor.


Why Death Doesn't Take a Holiday This Time of Year
Each winter, a strange phenomenon repeats itself as people gather to celebrate the holiday season: Deaths spike.
The surge was particularly extreme in early 2015, when nearly a third more senior citizens died than normal in the first two weeks of the new year.
Researchers have known for some time that more people die in winter. But even when they adjust for the expected increase, an irrepressible bulge that begins to swell in December persists.
Experts aren't quite sure what causes it, but it affects nearly every age and disease group. It fells both men and women. And, curiously, after researchers adjust for it, three days emerge as the deadliest for deaths of natural causes: Dec. 25, Dec. 26 and Jan. 1.
"These increases are above and beyond what you would expect for that season," said David Phillips, a sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the phenomenon. "We did not find equivalent spikes on any other major holiday. There's something about Christmas and New Year."


In 2016 Photo Finish, Two Boys Share Title
In hypercompetitive New York City, debate can break out even about which hospital has bragging rights to the first birth of the year.
Early Friday, New York City Health and Hospitals announced its first baby of 2016, a boy named Zayden Noel, born at exactly midnight at Coney Island Hospital.
Within hours, Northwell Health's Long Island Jewish Medical Center in eastern Queens called a news conference to highlight what it called New York's first baby of 2016—and attached proof in a photograph of in-utero fetal monitoring showing the boy was born at exactly 12 a.m.
"It sounds like it's going to be a battle of the babies," said Nicole Francois, spokeswoman for Coney Island Hospital. She promised to check Zayden Noel's fetal monitoring for "the tiebreaker."
"Every hospital definitely wants to have the first baby because it's a blessing," she said.


Fleeing Residents Detail Ramadi Horrors
HABBANIYA, Iraq—Umm Mustafa fled with her family for four hours on foot over Ramadi's perilous front lines early last week, at one point dodging Islamic State's bullets as she carried her youngest son in her arms.
Taking that risk was far better than living in the hell that was Ramadi under Islamic State rule, she said, where she, her husband and their five children had been forced into near starvation and used as human shields as the jihadists tried to fend off Iraqi government forces' assault on the capital of Anbar province.
"We never believed we would survive this," said Umm Mustafa, speaking on Thursday from a camp for internally displaced Iraqi civilians outside the town of Habbaniya, 50 miles west of Baghdad. "But when we open our eyes we're amazed. It's a miracle for us."
Hundreds of civilians have been housed in the camp since Iraq's government said it had retaken Ramadi on Dec. 28. Fighting continued Friday against militants still in control of eastern suburbs of the city, where the militants are still forcing 200 families to serve as human shields, the Anbar provincial council said.
Stories like Umm Mustafa's offer a window into the array of brutal tactics that allow small groups of Islamic State fighters to repel attacks by much larger, better-armed opponents for months at a time.


Defenders of Confederate Symbols Mount Counterattack
ATLANTA—Not since at least the civil-rights movement have Americans challenged the South's Confederate symbols as fervently as they did in 2015.
The June massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by a believed white supremacist "opened the floodgates," said John W. Adams, spokesman for the Florida Sons of Confederate Veterans.
Since then, officials in South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Florida and elsewhere removed or took steps to dismantle flags and other symbols from the region's secessionist past.
In June, South Carolina's Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, flanked by other political leaders in her state, called for removal of a Confederate battle flag flying in front of the state Capitol. "A hundred and fifty years after the end of the Civil War the time has come," she said to loud applause. The flag came down July 10.
Alabama's Republican Gov. Robert Bentley also ordered Confederate flags taken down at that state's Capitol, and the University of Texas at Austin removed a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from the campus's South Mall.


Obama Is Criticized Over Delay on Iran Missile Sanctions
WASHINGTON—Leading lawmakers, including supporters of President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, rapped the White House for delaying fresh sanctions on Tehran over its missile program, warning that the move would embolden it to further destabilize the Middle East.
The abrupt reversal by the administration came as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani publicly ordered his military to dramatically scale up the country's missile program if the sanctions went ahead.
Senior U.S. officials have told lawmakers the sanctions were delayed because of evolving diplomatic work between the White House and the Iranian government.
Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, on Saturday said the U.S. government has more diplomatic and technical work to do before imposing new sanctions. Still, the U.S. wouldn't negotiate the imposition of sanctions with Iran, he said. "They don't get a say on who we impose sanctions on," Mr. Rhodes told reporters in Hawaii, where Mr. Obama has been vacationing. "We just have additional work that needs to be done."
The administration had notified Congress on Wednesday that it would impose new financial penalties on nearly a dozen companies and individuals for their alleged role in developing Iran's ballistic missile program, but pulled back later that day.


Establishment Candidates Battle to End Voter Flirtation With Outsiders
With less than a month before voting begins, establishment presidential candidates, thrown off stride by insurgent rivals through much of last year, are urging voters to move toward conventional choices and end their flirtation with the field's novices and outsiders.
The efforts reflect the hope on the part of such candidates that the dynamic of the campaign will change now that the calendar has turned to 2016 and real choices are nearly at hand.
"Showtime is over," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a crowd Monday at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. He questioned the seriousness of businessman Donald Trump as a candidate, saying these are "dangerous, perilous times" for the nation and the world, and added: "We are not electing an entertainer-in-chief."
Not far away, former President Bill Clinton made a similar argument to New Hampshire voters on behalf of the Democratic candidacy of his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"I do not believe in my lifetime anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance, who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now," Mr. Clinton said Monday at a community college in Nashua.


Hillary's Chance to Hijack the Populist Surge
You don't have to be a Marxist to believe that economics shapes politics. Shared prosperity yields hope and even a measure of generosity. Slow growth breeds doubt about the future and a politics of resentment.
That is where we are today.
Barring a fourth-quarter miracle, the U.S. just concluded the 10th straight year in which economic growth failed to reach 3%. Even excluding the Great Recession years of 2008-09, economic growth since 2005 has averaged just a bit over 2%. There is no parallel for this since the end of World War II, maybe not since the beginning of the Republic.
And the future holds more of the same. The Congressional Budget Office foresees annual growth of 0.5% in the U.S. labor force over the next 25 years, down from 1.7% between 1965 and 2007. By assuming that productivity gains rebound from the low level of recent years to their postwar average, the CBO projects average annual economic growth of 2.2%, down from 3.3% during the four decades before the Great Recession.
We can stop arguing about the "new normal." We're in it. And it is even worse than it looks.


Saudis Step Up War of Words With Iran
RIYADH—Saudi Arabia on Saturday accused Iran of not acting like a nation state and said it is considering further measures against its regional rival, as tensions between the two countries escalated further over the kingdom's execution of a dissident Shiite cleric.
"Iran has to make a decision whether it is a nation state or a revolution. If it's a nation state, it should act like one," Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said following an emergency meeting in Riyadh with his Gulf Arab counterparts to discuss the crisis with Iran. "Sectarianism wasn't heard of in the region before the Iranian revolution."
"We are looking at additional measures to be taken against Iran if it continues with its current policies," he said.
The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council—a six-country bloc comprising Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman—met amid concerns that the spat between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran may lead to serious repercussions for other conflicts in the region.
The GCC countries in a joint statement urged Iran to "respect the principle of good neighborliness in words and actions" and "stop activities that cause instability in the region."


Clinton Goes on the Attack as Sanders Makes Gains
Hillary Clinton all-but ignored rival Bernie Sanders for months, hoping to avoid alienating his fervent backers whose support she'll need if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination. Now, she no longer has that luxury.
As polls show Mr. Sanders ahead in New Hampshire and closing the gap in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton, her daughter and top campaign aides have unleashed a string of attacks on the Vermont senator's policy agenda.
The shift in tone marks a turning point in the Democratic race as Mrs. Clinton works to avoid back-to-back defeats in the first two presidential contests.
Clinton aides say her rival is dodging scrutiny by not releasing a health-care plan and bending to the gun lobby in backing liability protections for manufacturers. The Clinton camp also is warning that nominating Mr. Sanders would be akin to turning the White House over to Republicans.
"We're in that stage of a campaign where we've each been introducing ourselves. We've been talking about our particular views on issues. Now it's time to draw some contrasts," Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday on NBC.


Cruz Gets a Bronx Cheer from New York
Around New York on Friday, prominent officials from across the political spectrum declared themselves united against a common enemy: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
Mr. Cruz's attack on "New York values" in Thursday's Republican presidential debate sparked an outcry among the city's and state's top politicians, most prominently Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
In three TV interviews on Friday, the Democratic governor excoriated Mr. Cruz.
"We're not judgmental, negative and hostile, the way Cruz was," Mr. Cuomo told NY1. "In one 30-second sound-bite, he was offensive to gays, he was offensive to women, he offended 18 million New Yorkers—one of the largest congressional delegations, by the way, in the country."
At a campaign event Friday, Mr. Cruz responded to calls for an apology: "I apologize to the millions of New Yorkers who have been let down by liberal politicians in that state."


Trump, Cruz Fight on GOP's Right Flank
MILFORD, N.H.—Jennifer Ouellette is like many conservatives two weeks before the first votes are cast: thrilled that Sen. Ted Cruz is a leading Republican presidential candidate but flummoxed that his top challenger is Donald Trump.
"How do I convince these people to stop looking at the shiny object and to understand who is the constitutional conservative?" the mother of two from Atkinson, N.H., asked Mr. Cruz at a gathering here Sunday night. "I am having a big fight with my sister about this."
As the 2016 primary season barrels toward its first balloting, the GOP establishment wing's split in support of multiple candidates would in previous years have buoyed conservative activists, who have typically been the ones to split among several contenders. But Mr. Trump's unexpectedly enduring candidacy has complicated that.
In the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 61% of Republican primary voters describe themselves as conservative. Messrs. Trump and Cruz split that potentially dominant voting bloc almost in half, with 31% saying they support the New York businessman while 27% are backing the senator. Mr. Cruz outpaces Mr. Trump among the most conservative Republican primary voters by a margin of 36% to 28%, by virtue of his support among evangelical voters.
To many activist groups who are beginning to coalesce around Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump's appeal among conservatives lies more in his antiestablishment rhetoric, particularly on issues such as immigration, than on most of his policy stances. As the first votes get closer, private gnashing of teeth among the ranks of conservative Republicans about Mr. Trump, and his support among many on the right, is beginning to burst into the open.


New York City Council Spending Is on the Rise
The New York City Council has increased its spending by millions of dollars over the past two years, hiring additional staff as it seeks to pass more legislation and play a greater role in the city's land-use process under Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito.
The council is budgeted to spend $61 million by the end of this fiscal year, which ends June 30, a 7.2% increase from the $56.9 million it spent in fiscal 2015, according to the Independent Budget Office. This year's council budget represents an 18.4% increase from fiscal 2014, the last budget under former Speaker Christine Quinn.
Compared with the overall budget, which this year totals $79.93 billion, the council spending is small. But budget experts say the increases are attention-getting, in part because they more than make up for cuts made in fiscal 2009 during the recession. That year, the body's budget dipped to $49.5 million.
Mayor Bill de Blasio's preliminary budget for fiscal 2017 is expected to be released Thursday.
Concerned about overall spending, about half of the council last month wrote the mayor to urge him to seek 5% in savings from each city agency—a budgeting practice known as a "program to eliminate the gap," or "peg."


Judge Denies Bail in Scarsdale Murder Case
A Westchester County judge denied bail Friday to a Scarsdale, N.Y., man charged in the murder of his wife, a prominent New York City pediatrician.
Julius "Jules" Reich, 61 years old, was arrested Wednesday and charged with second-degree murder in the stabbing of his wife Robin Goldman, 58. Judge Anne Minihan denied him bail over the objections of his attorney.
"Mr. Reich has worked and lived in New York his entire life and has a reputation both in his work and personal life as a gentle kind man," said Kerry Lawrence, Mr. Reich's attorney. "The allegations that he was likely to flee if released on bail are baseless."
Police said that Mr. Reich called 911 Wednesday morning and reported that a woman was seriously injured. Dr. Goldman, who worked as a pediatrician in the Bronx, was found dead by the police when they arrived.
Mr. Reich, a partner at an accounting, tax and advisory firm in Manhattan, filed for divorce last year, and he and his wife were scheduled to make their first court appearance Monday, according to court records.


Leftist Parties to Try Forming Coalition in Spain
MADRID—Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy declined on Friday to put himself up for a re-election vote in Spain's new parliament, after two leftist rivals said they would try to form a governing alliance and end four years of conservative rule.
Both moves were unexpected and appeared to break an impasse produced by Spain's Dec. 20 parliamentary election, improving though not ensuring, the chance that a leftist coalition would take office in the coming weeks.
Until Friday, it appeared no party leader would be capable of winning a vote of confidence in the fragmented parliament and that a new general election would be required.
That situation changed when Pablo Iglesias, whose antiausterity Podemos party finished third in the December elections, said he was willing to share power in a government led by the mainstream Socialist party, which finished second.
Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez welcomed the offer, saying his party would open negotiations with Podemos and other leftist parties in the coming days and "do what it needs to do to form a government of change."


Michigan Governor Seeks More Aid for Flint Victims
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder pledged more state assistance to address the lead-contamination crisis in Flint, as well as seeking federal loans and an expansion of Medicaid coverage for residents under the age of 21.
"Now is the time to do things to help the people of Flint address the damage that's been done," said Gov. Snyder. "This is the start of a longer-term process to make sure that we are committed to Flint."
The governor, speaking at a joint news conference Wednesday morning at Flint's City Hall with Mayor Karen Weaver, said more state officials, including Transformation Manager Rich Baird, would work out of a new state office in Flint to remain in close contact with events on the ground. He said Lt. Gov. Brian Calley would also visit the city more often.
In addition to seeking to expand Medicaid coverage for residents, the governor said the state would ask the federal Small Business Administration to make low-interest loans available to local business owners.
The governor also said that the state Senate would take up his request for $28 million in funding to address the city's water crisis. A bill was passed by the state House last week with unanimous support. But he said this money, which includes $8 million for bottled water, was only a start. "The $28 million is not the only request we're going to have," he said.


In Iowa, Some Votes Outweigh Others
DES MOINES, Iowa—Not all votes are equal in the Democratic caucuses in Iowa, and that might be a problem for Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Delegates—the people who will ultimately choose the Democratic Party's presidential nominee—are picked based on a predetermined formula involving past general elections, not on the statewide popular vote or caucus participation. Mr. Sanders draws strong support from college towns, but the number of delegates available from those places won't grow no matter how many people he turns out Monday night.
"This is not a primary, it's a caucus system," said Tom Harkin, the state's longtime Democratic senator who himself ran for president in 1992, winning the Iowa caucuses but not the nomination. "It tests your ability to get your support broadly around the state, not just how many votes you can get."
That means running up big vote counts in urban areas or college towns won't clinch the victory because there are many delegates to be had across the rest of the state. A string of wins in small and midsize counties could overwhelm strong performance in the cities. Both campaigns use sophisticated modeling to try to figure out where they'll get the biggest bang for their buck, while also trying to reach into as many corners of the state as possible.
"It really just comes down to that delegate math and where it makes the most sense to go," said Brendan Summers, caucus director for the Sanders campaign. "We recognize we may not have all the resources in the world. How can we maximize our effectiveness and efficiency? How can we pick up a few more wins?"


Cruz Camp Gets Flak for Carson Rumor
Sen. Ted Cruz's post-Iowa victory lap has been clouded by a dispute with Ben Carson and Donald Trump over allegations that the Texas senator's supporters had spread false rumors on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Mr. Carson would be dropping out of the race.
The feud escalated Wednesday when Mr. Carson said that the misinformation had affected the outcome of the contest and Mr. Trump, who came in second place behind Mr. Cruz in Iowa, said the Iowa results should be overturned.
"Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified," Mr. Trump said on Twitter. "Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it."
Mr. Cruz said he hadn't been aware his campaign was spreading false information about Mr. Carson and called him to apologize on Tuesday. But he was less polite in his response to Mr. Trump's remarks on the matter.
"My girls are 5 and 7," the Texas senator said. "And I've got to tell you, Caroline and Catherine are better behaved than a presidential candidate who responds by insulting everyone every day."


NYPD Officers Raise Questions About Training
Testimony from two New York Police Department officers during the trial of an officer charged in the death of an unarmed man raised questions Thursday about whether the officers received adequate first-aid training when they were police cadets.
Officer Shaun Landau told a jury in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn that he "didn't feel qualified to give CPR" to Akai Gurley after his partner, Officer Peter Liang, shot Mr. Gurley in the stairwell of a Brooklyn public-housing complex in November 2014.
Lawyers for Officer Liang, who is charged with manslaughter and other counts in Mr. Gurley's death, have said the rookie officer fired his gun accidentally when he stepped into the dark stairwell. Officer Liang, now 28 years old, went into a state of shock after he discovered that the bullet hit Mr. Gurley, they said.
On Thursday afternoon, Officer John Funk, who attended the police academy with Officers Liang and Landau, also testified that his CPR training at the academy was incomplete. The officer, one of the first witnesses for the defense, said he never practiced on a mannequin, as is required.
Earlier in the trial, a police academy instructor testified that student officers receive about 14 hours of CPR and other first-aid training and must pass a test on these skills to become officers.


Cruz Fires Salvos at His Top Two Rivals
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.—Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday questioned the behavior of one of his top Republican presidential rivals, moments before telling a crowd that voters aren't "interested in insults and attacks."
"Donald Trump is very rattled right now," Mr. Cruz told the crowd at a Toyota dealership. "He told the entire world he was going to win Iowa, and he didn't. And his reaction is he got very angry."
Mr. Cruz predicted a repeat performance after next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. "I assumed the next question he's going to ask is 'How stupid can the people of New Hampshire be?' " Mr. Cruz said, in a slightly misleading reference to comments Mr. Trump made earlier in the campaign about Iowa voters.
Since finishing second in Iowa, Mr. Trump has accused the Texas senator of "stealing" the caucuses because his supporters suggested Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. On Thursday, Mr. Trump sought to move away from the sharp exchanges with Mr. Cruz and focus on other issues.
Candidates regularly portray themselves as above the fray while strafing rivals with none-too-subtle digs. "This is a job interview," Mr. Cruz told the crowd, in response to a sympathetic question from the audience. "I don't think people are interested in temper tantrums."


China's Overseas Abductions
Chinese dissident journalist Li Xin went missing on Jan. 11 in Thailand. On Wednesday he phoned his wife from China, telling her, "I came back to China willingly to face investigation." Mr. Li's wife, He Fangmei, wasn't fooled. "I know it was all their words, and that Li Xin was speaking against his wishes," she told the Journal.
Ms. He is right to be skeptical. In recent months several Chinese dissidents have disappeared from Thailand and Hong Kong and reappeared in mainland police custody. At least two say they went to China of their own free will and the world shouldn't interfere—words their friends and family say were spoken under duress.
Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong publisher of dissident books who holds a Swedish passport, disappeared from Thailand on Oct. 17. Thai authorities say they had no record of him leaving the country. Mr. Gui made a contrite appearance on Chinese state television on Jan. 17 and said he returned to China voluntarily to face charges from a 2003 drunk-driving case. Three of Mr. Gui's colleagues went missing while visiting China in October.
Another of Mr. Gui's colleagues, Lee Bo, told reporters he wasn't afraid as long as he stayed in Hong Kong. Famous last words. He was last seen at his Hong Kong warehouse on Dec. 30, and the local government has no record of him crossing the border to China. Mr. Lee telephoned his wife from Shenzhen to say he is assisting police with an investigation, and he has since written two letters saying he doesn't want assistance. Mr. Lee is British, but neither he nor Mr. Gui have been allowed to meet with consular officials.
On Monday the U.S. State Department's John Kirby expressed concern over the threat to Hong Kong's autonomy posed by the disappearance of the five booksellers. "We urge China to clarify the current status of all five individuals and the circumstances surrounding their disappearances and to allow them to return to their homes," he said.


The Rogue-State Nuclear Missile Threat
Americans have been focused on New Hampshire and Iowa, but spare a thought for Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago. Those are among the cities within range of the intercontinental ballistic missile tested Sunday by North Korea. Toledo and Pittsburgh are still slightly out of range, but at least 120 million Americans with the wrong zip codes could soon be targets of Kim Jong Un.
Welcome to the era of the rogue-state ICBM. North Korea's portly young dictator is often played for laughs, but before he rose to power in 2011 Pyongyang had never successfully put a satellite into orbit, a major technical step toward mastering long-range missile delivery. Now it has done so twice, a disturbing complement to its four nuclear tests, the latest of which was last month.
***
"We assess that they have the capability to reach the [U.S.] homeland with a nuclear weapon from a rocket," U.S. Admiral Bill Gortney of the North American Aerospace Defense Command said in October, echoing warnings from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the U.S. commander in South Korea. Such assessments are necessarily speculative given the opacity of the Hermit Kingdom and the complexities of miniaturizing and delivering warheads, but the trend is ominous.
Though last month's nuclear test had too small a yield to be the hydrogen-bomb success that Pyongyang claims, it may have included components of an H-bomb and advanced its miniaturization capabilities. Sunday's launch appears to have carried twice the payload of Pyongyang's previous effort, in 2012, which established a missile range of 10,000 kilometers, enough to hit Chicago. If Kim extends his range to 13,000 kilometers, he'd threaten the entire continental U.S.
Other rogues are following suit. Iran recently conducted two ballistic-missile launches in violation of its recent nuclear deal. These are a "deliberate message of defiance," U.S. intelligence chief Jim Clapper told Congress Tuesday, adding that Tehran has launched 140 times since a United Nations resolution banned launches in 2010. Mr. Clapper also revealed that North Korea recently expanded plutonium production.


The Carolina Pander for Black Votes
South Carolina is ground zero for the complicated, often ugly and visceral, racial politics that creep their way into presidential campaigns every four years.
In 2000 Republican dirty tricksters used push polling to spread a false rumor that Sen. John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. That same year Mr. McCain called the Confederate flag a "symbol of heritage," saying it should be up to South Carolinians whether to display it on their statehouse grounds. He later apologized, admitting that he had compromised his principles in an effort to win the state's primary.
In 2008, after Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the Palmetto State, Bill Clinton seemed to suggest that it was only because of race: "Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in '84 and '88." Several weeks later Geraldine Ferraro, who backed Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, raised eyebrows. "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position," she told a reporter. "He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept."
This year's South Carolina primary promises to be the canary in the coal mine for Democrats: Can Hillary hold black voters? Can Bernie steal them away? Mr. Sanders essentially tied Mrs. Clinton in Iowa, where 91% of Democratic caucusgoers were white. He then badly beat her in New Hampshire, where 93% of Democratic primary voters were white. Now South Carolina's black voters—who made up more than half of turnout in the party's 2008 primary—are all that stands between Mrs. Clinton and a campaign free fall.
So we are seeing black politicians, intellectuals, activists and media figures practically tripping over themselves to tell black voters how to use this moment of political leverage. The rush of endorsements from the black elite has inevitably led to charges that the candidates are pandering to black Americans. It has also led to a tussle over the mantle of the nation's top black politician, President Obama.


Obama Vows Help to Counter China in Southeast Asia
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.—President Barack Obama concluded a two-day summit with Southeast Asian leaders by promising to help allies in the region counter China's expanding territorial and maritime claims.
Mr. Obama said in a news conference on Tuesday at the sprawling Sunnylands resort in California that the leaders had discussed the need for "tangible steps" to lower tensions in the South China Sea, "including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas."
"Freedom of navigation must be upheld, and lawful commerce should not be impeded," Mr. Obama said. "We will continue to help our allies and partners strengthen their maritime capabilities."
All of the prescriptions were aimed at Beijing, which has engaged in massive dredging operations to build up artificial islands and develop them for military uses, among others, while claiming disputed territory in the region.
The president also said he stressed to the leaders the importance of democracy and human rights.


Hospitals Strain to Meet Deadline on Electronic Prescriptions
New York hospitals and physicians are scrambling to meet a state mandate to electronically prescribe all medications, with some institutions asking for extra time to comply with a 2012 law to curb prescription drug abuse, medical errors and fraud.
New York is the first state to mandate e-prescribing for all prescriptions with penalties for noncompliance, said Zeynep Sumer-King, vice president of regulatory and professional affairs at the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Among institutions asking for waivers from the law for at least some of its medical departments or doctors are Montefiore Health System, Northwell Health, NYU Langone Medical Center and Mount Sinai Health System. They are asking for more time to comply beyond March 27, when e-prescribing becomes mandatory.
The law, known as the I-STOP Act, or Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing, will effectively end the days of a doctor scribbling on a prescription pad. Instead, a doctor will send prescriptions electronically to a pharmacy of the patient's choice.
While the law affects all drugs, its main thrust is to more tightly regulate the flow of controlled substances such as narcotics, stimulants and sedatives, which can be abused.


GOP Cites Biden Video in Clash Over Court Pick
WASHINGTON—Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) on Monday said 1992 comments by Vice President Joe Biden are a justification for Republicans to not act in an election year on a nominee to succeed the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Mr. Grassley, who hasn't said definitively whether his panel would convene hearings on a nominee from President Barack Obama, referred in a Senate floor speech to comments by Mr. Biden in June 1992. At the time, Mr. Biden, who was a senator from Delaware and judiciary chairman, said then-President George H.W. Bush should consider not naming a successor during the election year if a Supreme Court justice were to resign.
If the Republican president were to submit a nominee, Mr. Biden also said the Democratic-controlled Senate "should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over."
Republicans used Mr. Biden's remarks, which resurfaced online Monday, as new ammunition in the fight over whether to allow the conservative Justice Scalia, who died this month, to be replaced with a more liberal judge during an election year.
In a statement Monday, Mr. Biden said that "one excerpt" of his speech was "not an accurate description of my views" on the topic. In the same speech, he said, he also "urged the Senate and White House to work together to overcome partisan differences" in filling high-court vacancies. He noted that a Democratic president would have the same obligation working with a GOP-controlled Senate.


The Donald Doesn't Have a Lock—Yet
Donald Trump scored a very impressive win in Nevada, taking 45.9% and 14 of the state's 30 delegates to the GOP convention. But the Republican nomination is far from settled. After four contests, only 133 of the convention's 2,472 delegates have been selected.
It's important to put Nevada in context. Caucuses draw a smaller turnout than primaries and 75,216—17.8% of the state's 423,308 Republicans—turned out. While the number of voters was higher than in previous Silver State caucuses, it would have required 128,685 Nevada Republicans voting to match Iowa's turnout.
After carrying 24.3% in Iowa, 35.3% in New Hampshire and 32.5% in South Carolina, Mr. Trump hit a new high Tuesday. Is he consolidating Republicans? Perhaps, but a single caucus victory does not necessarily a consolidation make.
None of the 12 Republican hopefuls who have dropped out of the race has endorsed Mr. Trump. The Donald's trademark insults, more pungent and personal than run-of-the-mill campaign attacks, make it difficult for those whom he ridiculed, and their supporters, to rally to him.
The choices made by late-deciding voters would be a sign of consolidation, but in South Carolina Mr. Trump drew only 17% of those who made up their mind in the final week of the campaign. Among the 30% in Nevada who decided in the final week, Sen. Marco Rubio carried 42%, far more than any candidate.


Libya Will Need American Help to Defeat ISIS, U.S. General Says
Islamic State, which has spread across Libya by taking advantage of conflict between the country's two rival governments, has become too strong to be rolled back without U.S. help, a senior American commander said.
Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, the commander of U.S. special-operations forces in Africa, estimated that American military involvement would be needed in Libya even if a unity government were formed.
"Our assessment, purely looking at it through the [special-operations forces] lens, is that our partners need our advice and assistance. They need our training and a certain amount of equipping in order to be successful. That is the gap," he said in an interview in Dakar, Senegal.
Gen. Bolduc declined to discuss current or pending operations. But his comments, while limited to the special-operations arena, are more specific about possible action in Libya than those made previously by other high-ranking U.S. officials.
Top military officials say they have presented the White House with options for military operations in Libya, which would involve other countries and local forces.


Staring at the Conservative Gutter
In the late 1950s, Bill Buckley decreed that nobody whose name appeared on the masthead of the American Mercury magazine would be published in the pages of National Review. The once-illustrious Mercury of H.L. Mencken had become a gutter of far-right anti-Semites. Buckley would not allow his magazine to be tainted by them.
The word for Buckley's act is "lustration," and for two generations it upheld the honor of the mainstream conservative movement. Liberals may have been fond of claiming that Republicans were all closet bigots and that tax cuts were a form of racial prejudice, but the accusation rang hollow because the evidence for it was so tendentious.
Not anymore. The candidacy of Donald Trump is the open sewer of American conservatism. This Super Tuesday, polls show a plurality of GOP voters intend to dive right into it, like the boy in the "Slumdog Millionaire" toilet scene. And they're not even holding their noses.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has endorsed the Code Pink view of the Iraq War (Bush lied; people died). He has cited and embraced an aphorism of Benito Mussolini. ("It's a very good quote," Mr. Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd.) He has refused to release his "very beautiful" tax returns. And he has taken his time disavowing the endorsement of onetime Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke—offering, by way of a transparently dishonest excuse, that "I know nothing about David Duke." Mr. Trump left the Reform Party in 2000 after Mr. Duke joined it.
None of this seems to have made the slightest dent in Mr. Trump's popularity. If anything it has enhanced it. In the species of political pornography in which Mr. Trump trafficks, the naughtier the better. The more respectable opinion is scandalized by whatever pops out of the Donald's mouth, the more his supporters cheer him for sticking it to the snobs and the scolds. The more Mr. Trump traduces the old established lines of decency, the more he affirms his supporters' most shameless ideological instincts.


Hillary Clinton Dominates Super Tuesday Races
Hillary Clinton won sweeping primary victories in Texas and throughout the South on Super Tuesday, a sign that the Democratic presidential front-runner was vaulting to a commanding lead in the race for the nomination and leaving rival Bernie Sanders diminishing space to stage a comeback.
Mr. Sanders captured his home state of Vermont and Oklahoma. But Mrs. Clinton easily won the delegate-rich Southern states of Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas, as well as Texas, the Associated Press projected—propelled by African-American voters who are a sizable share of the Democratic electorate.
"What a Super Tuesday!" Mrs. Clinton said in celebration from Florida, during a speech that touched on general-election themes. In an unmistakable reference to the slogan of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who was having his own strong night, she said, "America has never stopped being great. We have to make America whole."
Mrs. Clinton's dominant performance on the biggest day of the primary season amounted to a decisive resurgence for a candidate who lost one bid for the presidency in 2008 after being the early favorite and seemed threatened in another.
Favored to win everywhere when the race against Mr. Sanders began, Mrs. Clinton captured Iowa on Feb. 1 by the barest of margins, then lost New Hampshire by 22 points. That slow start prompted a round of second-guessing by Democrats who cast her as a flawed candidate who had yet to lay out a compelling rationale for being president.


Exit Poll: Slovakia's Ruling Party Falls Short of Majority
An exit poll indicated that Slovakia's governing anti-immigration party had won the most seats in Saturday's parliamentary elections but was likely to fall short of a majority in parliament.
Prime Minister Robert Fico's left-leaning Smer-Social Democracy party campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, criticizing Germany for opening its doors to refugees from the Middle East and arguing that the policy has helped fuel the European Union's migration crisis.
An exit poll conducted by Slovakian television channel Markiza TV suggested that Smer had won 27.3% of votes, while the center-right Freedom and Solidarity party, or SaS, unexpectedly finished second with 13.3%.
Officials results from the vote weren't expected until Sunday. If they confirm the exit poll, though, Smer would face the difficult task of trying to build a coalition with more than one partner. The exit poll indicated that between seven and nine parties were likely to have won seats in Slovakia's unicameral legislature. The exit poll showed Smer was poised to win 45 seats in the 150-seat legislature, while SaS could get 22.
Mr. Fico had been expected to build a coalition with the far-right Slovak National Party, with which he governed from 2006 to 2010, if his party secured a stronger showing. But if the vote count bears out the exit poll, he will have to cobble together a broader coalition or risk going into the opposition in parliament. The Slovak National Party appeared to win 8% of the vote, according to the exit poll, while Nase Slovensko, another far-right party, looked set to win 6.8% of the vote.


Christie Rebuked for Taking Trip as Rail Strike Looms
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to begin an out-of-state vacation Tuesday as talks intensify to avert a potential NJ Transit railroad strike, reigniting criticism that the governor isn't tending to critical issues at home.
A work stoppage at the nation's third-busiest commuter railroad would wreak havoc on commuters, and Mr. Christie's critics are already blaming the Republican governor for not doing enough to settle the conflict. The governor, who ended his bid for the White House last month, campaigned extensively out of state last year.
Union officials have threatened to strike as soon as Sunday morning if they don't reach a deal, and negotiations continued Monday. The governor holds significant sway over NJ Transit's leadership; his acting transportation commissioner serves as the agency's chairman.
"Leadership is not something you phone in," said state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat and chairman of his chamber's transportation committee. "That is an absolute dereliction of his responsibility to the people in New Jersey."
Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the governor, dismissed the criticism. "Looking at the assemblyman's one liner, it reads like fortune-cookie wisdom," he said.


Senate FAA Bill Won't Include Air-Traffic Control Privatization
The hopes of many House Republican leaders to shift the entire U.S. air-traffic system under an independent, nonprofit corporation are about to die before a Senate committee holds its first hearing, according to industry officials and others familiar with the matter.
GOP members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month pushed through what they described as a "transformational" bill stripping such functions—along with some 38,000 associated employees—out of the Federal Aviation Administration. But the dramatic traffic control proposal isn't expected to be included when the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation introduces its bipartisan version of the legislation as soon as this week, the people familiar with the matter said.
Details of the Senate package were being worked on Tuesday and were expected to be completed as early as Wednesday, according to these people.
But if the Senate measure leaves out the controversial traffic control provision as expected, it would be highly unlikely to be put back during committee consideration or on the Senate floor.
With the agency's legislative authority slated to expire at the end the month, both sides of Capitol Hill are gearing up to pass a short-term FAA extension bill. Once that occurs, proponents of privatization will lose important leverage to try to enact sweeping changes.


Donald Trump's Mexican Imports
Donald Trump is going to build a wall, and it's going to be a beautiful wall, and everyone will love it—but it's also going to have one notable side entrance. To wit, the GOP frontrunner won't let Mexicans into America but he'll make an exception for Mexican drugs.
Mr. Trump released a 10-paragraph health plan last week, perhaps in response to the criticism that he has no policy details. We'll discuss the complete outline at a later date, but one detail that leapt out for comment is his endorsement of foreign pharmaceutical importation—an idea even liberals left for dead a decade ago. His campaign promises to "remove barriers to entry into free markets," because "allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers."
Sorry, it won't. The U.S. maintains a "closed" drug distribution network of manufacturers, suppliers and pharmacies—precisely because overseas drugs often aren't safe and dependable. Recent years have seen a proliferation of pill mills and forgery rings that slip counterfeit or adulterated products into global supply chains. The World Health Organization estimates 10% of drugs world-wide are bogus.
In the case of Mexico, the U.S. State Department warns travellers that as many as 25% of the medications available south of the border are fake. The Los Zetas, Sinaloa and Juárez cartels have diversified their portfolios into deceptive pharmaceuticals. The modern "closed" U.S. system was created in 1999 because Southern California was awash with fraudulent black-market compounds smuggled from Mexico.
But even the Canadian market is contaminated with counterfeits from China, India and Pakistan, where cooking pseudo-medicines is a cottage industry. Countries that don't respect intellectual property also tend not to invest in the security and enforcement to protect it—with patient safety as collateral damage.


Lead Fears Shut Down Water Fountains in Newark Schools
New Jersey officials shut off drinking water in the state's largest school district Wednesday after tests showed elevated levels of lead.
The Newark Public Schools turned off water fountains at 30 school buildings, the state Department of Environmental Protection said. That is about half of the district's 61 school buildings, according to the Associated Press.
Classes weren't canceled, and the state and county delivered potable water for drinking and food preparation, officials said. The school district serves 35,000 students in one of the state's poorest cities.
The district discovered the issue after staff members at the Louise A. Spencer Elementary School in Newark noticed discoloration in the school's water last week.
"It's definitely a tragic situation for all of the parents and families in Newark. One school is too many," said Rashon Hasan, a member of the Newark school advisory board. "We need to have a strong plan of action."


In Ohio, Boehner's Legacy Crumbles With Rise of Trump
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio—The blue and white "NOTICE" in the window at Schuler's Bakery caused quite a stir when the owner put it up in November.
"This store is politically incorrect," the sign read. "We say Merry Christmas, God Bless America. We salute our flag & give thanks to our troops, police officers and fire fighters. If this offends you, you are welcome to LEAVE."
Trent Schuler, owner of the bakery founded by his grandfather in 1937, voted for Rep. John Boehner until the former House speaker quit in October. This November, he is backing the least Boehner-like candidate running for president: Donald Trump.
"At least I know I'm not getting more of the same," Mr. Schuler said.
Mr. Boehner resigned from his Ohio seat, which he held for 24 years, under threat of a conservative revolt within his own party. What remains of the former House speaker's legacy here could soon be swept away by forces unleashed by Mr. Trump.


Plenty of Political Climate Change
Sheldon Whitehouse took to the Senate floor last fall to assail our coverage of his climate agenda. We had criticized his plan to use the RICO law, created to prosecute mobsters, against people who disagree with him about global warming. We also criticized George Mason University's Jagadish Shukla, who wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other federal officials urging them to follow the Senator's advice. New developments aren't helping the credibility of Messrs. Shukla and Whitehouse.
In October Mr. Whitehouse denied that the RICO litigation threat—with its potential for treble damages—was intended to shut down scientific debate. The Rhode Island Democrat claimed he wants civil rather than criminal prosecutions of climate dissenters. As if bringing financial ruin on defendants accused of independent thought isn't bad enough.
But now it looks like the campaign to silence climate dissidents could move beyond a potential civil case—and we're not hearing a peep from Mr. Whitehouse. Attorney General Lynch told the Senate last week that her department had referred a request to prosecute climate dissent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Specifically, it was referred to the FBI's criminal investigative division. A Justice official says on background that this is "not an indication or recommendation of whether a matter merits investigation, but is simply a referral to an appropriate investigative authority at the Department."
Even as Sen. Whitehouse questioned Ms. Lynch on this very matter at the hearing, he uttered no criticism. His spokesman says the Senator still doesn't favor criminal investigations and that Mr. Whitehouse thought the FBI referral "appeared unusual for the pursuit of a civil investigation." But if Justice does throw people in jail for scientific skepticism, the message seems to be: Don't count on Mr. Whitehouse to defend your liberty.
While the FBI ponders whether to slap the cuffs on people who don't believe in U.N. climate models, scientists who agree with Mr. Whitehouse are thriving beyond the dreams of most academic researchers.


Divesting of Campus Outrage
Most days there's no difference between campus activists and the tenured professors who tutor them in grievance politics, so allow us to note rare courage among the nation's educators: On Sunday more than 230 members of Columbia University's faculty sent a letter to the school's trustees opposing demands that Columbia divest, boycott and sanction Israel.
The student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest is active at the New York campus and passed around a faculty petition pressing Columbia to stop investing in companies that sell to Israel— Hewlett-Packard , Boeing and others. The appeal denounces Israel's alleged "inhumane segregation" and "use of asymmetrical and excessive violence against Palestinian civilians." Some 70 faculty members signed.
Most signers teach anthropology or comparative literature, where truth is a hazy concept. This may explain why they ignore the depredations of Hamas, which fires rockets at civilians from the cover of schools and hospitals. As for "excessive violence," consider Taylor Force, the West Point graduate stabbed to death by a Palestinian earlier this month near Tel Aviv.
The faculty letter in response defends Israel's "thriving democracy" that protects "the individual rights of all citizens, including Arabs as well as Jews." The letter notes that "Israel withdrew unilaterally from Gaza," which is now "a base for attacks on Israeli civilians." The conclusion: "Columbia's ties with Israel need to be preserved."


Tourists Cut Back on Europe Trips After Bombings
When school superintendent David Hile saw a television report on the Brussels terrorist attacks last week, he knew he had to make an unpopular move: Cancel a high-school trip to Europe that was scheduled to leave two days later.
"I immediately knew we had to cancel," said the administrator of Licking Valley High School, based in a suburb outside Columbus, Ohio.
The March 22 bomb blasts in Brussels, which killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 300, came four months after the deadly terror attacks in Paris had already reduced travel to Europe, by far the most-visited region in the world.
The impact of the Brussels terror onslaught was immediate. Within days, occupancy rates at some hotels in the city plunged to just 25%, according to preliminary estimates from STR, a company that tracks hotel industry data. The rate had been 82% the night before the bombings.
Other European cities felt ripple effects. Hotel-occupancy rates in London slid to 58% by last Thursday, and those in Paris fell to 67%, according to STR. Those figures, based on a sample of hotels in each city, represent declines of 24.7 percentage points and 15.1 percentage points, respectively, compared with rates a year earlier, the company said.


The Real Tory Trouble
Britain has one of the world's more robust economies, and its ruling Conservatives are the most effective center-right party in Europe. But a brewing intra-party feud threatens the Tories' unity and even their policy coherence.
We don't mean the Brexit debate. Whether Britons choose to stay or leave the European Union, that argument will be settled once the referendum is held on June 23, and Conservatives will then have nearly four years to govern. But govern for the sake of what? David Cameron aspires to lead a "Tory modernization" that combines pro-growth and populist measures. Party loyalists were prepared to go along, but now they're balking at some of the Prime Minister's better ideas.
Witness George Osborne's abortive attempt this month to tweak welfare for the disabled. The Chancellor's 2016 budget sought to save £1.2 billion by 2020 by tightening eligibility for payments intended to compensate for the additional living costs associated with disability. The reform was modest: Recalibrating the point system for calculating benefits would have reduced monthly payouts for people who, for example, merely need a cheap plastic booster to raise the height of a toilet seat.
Yet Tories wilted amid inevitable opposition from left-wing special interests, and Mr. Osborne had to abandon the proposal. Worries about bad political appearances were part of it, since the benefit cut came in a budget that will also reduce the top corporate tax rate and offers middle-class earners an effective tax cut by adjusting brackets. This ostensibly motivated Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan Smith, who had previously implemented successful welfare reforms, to resign his cabinet seat this month.
The more serious problem is that the Tories are divided on such basic questions as how to stimulate growth and the role of the state. So the same party that is cutting the corporate tax rate to 17% from 28% in 2010 and boosted employment to record levels with pro-work welfare reforms also is ramping up child-care subsidies and carbon charges for industry.


FBI Offers to Help Agencies With Locked Phones
WASHINGTON—The Federal Bureau of Investigation told law-enforcement agencies around the country Friday it would try to help them open locked phones or other devices as much as "legal and policy constraints'' allow.
The unusual guidance from the nation's premier law-enforcement agency is in response to a surge of interest from state and local authorities in how the FBI was able to open a locked iPhone seized in the probe of a terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.
The FBI advisory seems to be aimed at reassuring police and prosecutors that while they don't have much to tell them now, they hope to provide more information and possibly help in the near future.
For months, the FBI had been unable to open the phone—a 5C model—and was engaged in a high-stakes legal battle with Apple Inc. trying to force the company to help open the device. The Justice Department ended that legal battle this week, when it said a third party outside the U.S. government had shown the Justice Department a new means of cracking the phone.
"That method for unlocking that specific iPhone proved successful,'' the FBI missive said, adding that the agency is aware that the difficulty of accessing locked data in criminal probes "is a substantial state and local law-enforcement challenge that you face daily.''


Republican Party Showdown Shifts to North Dakota
Republican presidential campaigns and their top surrogates will converge on North Dakota's Republican convention this weekend, a sign of how heated the battle for delegates has become as the possibility of a contested convention looms.
North Dakota awards a relatively small number of delegates, 28, compared with other states. But those delegates will be unbound, free to back any candidate and change their minds at any point before or during the convention.
The campaigns are eager to ensure the delegates elected support them in the event that no candidate acquires the minimum 1,237 delegates required to win the nomination—which has resulted in unexpected attention on North Dakota.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will address the convention on Saturday, along with former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, who has endorsed him. Ben Carson, a top surrogate for front-runner Donald Trump, will speak Sunday. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is sending former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey to speak Sunday.
"I've always had a vision that this would happen," said Curly Haughland, one of North Dakota's two Republican national committeemen. By the time the North Dakota convention was held in 2012, Mitt Romney was largely considered to have a lock on the GOP presidential nomination. No candidates attended the convention that year.


Democratic Race Sours as Key Contests Loom
SYRACUSE, N.Y.—Feuding between Hillary Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, escalated to new levels this past week, with the Vermont senator's campaign advisers demanding she apologize for saying they were "lying" about money she has gotten from the oil and gas industry.
Campaigning nonstop, both candidates are showing flashes of fatigue and impatience as the race barrels toward a series of key contests later this month in the delegate-rich states of New York and Pennsylvania. The sour tone could make it more difficult for the party to unify after the race is settled. A Wall Street Journal-NBC poll last month showed one-third of Sanders supporters can't see themselves voting for Mrs. Clinton in the fall if she becomes the nominee.
Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead in delegates, but she has lost five of the past six contests, and her campaign concedes she will be hard-pressed to win Wisconsin, where the primary is Tuesday. She is heading back there Saturday after three days of campaigning in New York. Fearing Wisconsin might be a lost cause, her staff once had considered making no more trips to the state and instead focusing on coming contests.
An indication of the contest's current tenor came at what began as a routine a campaign stop in Purchase, N.Y., on Thursday that ultimately produced one of the tensest moments Mrs. Clinton has had on the trail.
A group of Sanders supporters interrupted her speech, chanting, "If she wins, we lose." As they walked out, Mrs. Clinton said: "The Bernie people came to say that. We're very sorry you're leaving."


Brazil's Middle-Class Revolt
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff charged last week that the effort in Congress to impeach her is a "coup" attempt launched by her political adversaries. "I want tolerance, dialogue and peace," Ms. Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT) averred in a speech to supporters. "And that will only be possible if democracy is preserved."
Framing the effort to remove her from office as undemocratic is Ms. Rousseff's best hope for political survival—if you don't count buying allies in Congress. It's also ridiculous.
The impeachment petition has been in Congress since last year. But on Tuesday the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) quit the president's governing coalition, raising the odds that it will go forward. The PMDB is reacting to a popular outcry against the president. She is alleged, among other things, to have violated the country's fiscal responsibility law with stimulus spending during her re-election campaign, then of using creative accounting to hide it.
Last month some three million Brazilians took to the streets to call for her removal. Last week the country's bar association filed its own petition with Congress requesting impeachment.
Brazil's economic outlook is grim, and the recent discoveries of rampant corruption are demoralizing. But it can take a crisis to bring about reform, and the nonviolent, popular pushback is notable. The call to impeach is a sign of a maturing democracy in which civil society is confident enough to rise up against the political class.


Democratic Superdelegates Come Under Pressure
Along with his takeout from the vegan chain Native Foods Café, Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado received this note: "The constituency has spoken. Use your power wisely. Feel the Bern."
Mr. Polis, a superdelegate who has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, acknowledged the pressure on him to change his position in a state where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont handily won the Democratic caucuses. "Even my food takeout is lobbying me for #FeelTheBern," Mr. Polis tweeted late last month.
Mr. Sanders's recent victories in Colorado, Hawaii, Washington, Alaska and elsewhere have left some other Democrats defending their decision to back Mrs. Clinton at the party's convention in Philadelphia this July.
And more could feel the pressure if Mr. Sanders continues to rack up wins. He won the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, notching his seventh win in the last eight nominating contests. Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin including Rep. Gwen Moore and Sen. Tammy Baldwin backed Mrs. Clinton. All Democratic members of Congress are superdelegates.
Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who backs Mrs. Clinton, said he has had some "robust conversations" with constituents after Mr. Sanders won the state's Democratic caucuses on March 26, but doesn't plan to shift his stance.


Bernie Sanders Will Visit the Vatican
WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will visit the Vatican next week to discuss themes of economic and social justice that are the centerpiece of his campaign.
The Vermont senator said Friday that he would participate in an April 15 conference on social, economic and environmental issues at a Vatican academic organization, stepping off the campaign trail during the crucial last days before the New York primary.
Mr. Sanders said he was "moved" by the invitation and said he deeply admired Pope Francis, whom he isn't expected to meet with on the trip. In an MSNBC interview Friday morning, he praised the pope's efforts to "inject a sense of morality into how we do economics." The pope has called for actions to address income inequality and has criticized American-style capitalism.
The trip was announced as Mr. Sanders is looking to move past a tussle with his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, whom he denigrated this past week as "unqualified" for the presidency. He dialed back on those remarks Friday morning, saying "of course" Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, was qualified to be commander in chief.
"On her worst day she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates," Mr. Sanders said on NBC, adding that the two Democratic candidates should focus on the issues instead of leveling personal attacks.


Al Qaeda Affiliate Says It Killed Bangladeshi Student
DHAKA, Bangladesh—An al Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility for the killing of a secular activist in the capital Dhaka, fueling concerns international militant networks are gaining a foothold in the Muslim-majority South Asian country.
Nazimuddin Samad, a Bangladeshi law student who expressed secular views online, was attacked by unidentified assailants not far from his campus in southern Dhaka on Wednesday night and was left bleeding on the street, police said. Mr. Samad died after he was taken to a local hospital, according to police and doctors.
Al Qaeda In the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, claimed responsibility for the killing of Mr. Samad through a statement posted online Friday night, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a website that monitors Jihadist messages.
The statement said operatives of Ansar al-Islam Bangladesh—a banned al Qaeda-linked group—had carried out the attack on Mr. Samad in retaliation for "blasphemy against our beloved Prophet."
"We don't attack people for being atheist in their personal lives," the statement said. "We only target those who deride Islam and the Prophet."


Head of NYPD Watchdog Resigns Amid Suit
The chairman of the agency that investigates civilian complaints against the New York Police Department resigned Wednesday, hours after it emerged that he is the subject of a civil lawsuit filed by the agency's executive director.
Richard Emery said he decided to resign after a "lengthy substantive discussion" with Mayor Bill de Blasio, according to a statement he sent to the mayor's office around 4 p.m. Wednesday.
"He and I agree that the confluence of recent circumstances will preclude me from further fulfilling my goals" as chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Mr. Emery wrote.
Mr. Emery, a prominent civil-rights lawyer in the city, was appointed by Mr. de Blasio and has been credited with bringing needed changes to the organization, including reducing the times it takes to review cases and holding meetings in evenings and outside of Manhattan.
"Over the past two years, the CCRB has resolved cases much more quickly and efficiently, and I am thankful to Richard and the entire CCRB staff," Mr. de Blasio said. The mayor said CCRB board member Deborah N. Archer has agreed to serve as acting chair of the CCRB, effective immediately.


Candidates Court New York Republicans
NEW YORK—Republican front-runner Donald Trump put aside his trademark bravado and incendiary politics Thursday night to deliver an ode to the state he hopes to sweep in Tuesday's presidential primary.
The businessman spent much of his 25-minute speech talking about his real estate deals in New York City and promising to bring the same can-do approach to the White House. Wearing a tuxedo, Mr. Trump gave an extended riff on "New York values" that celebrated the state's resilience after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"It's a work ethic," Mr. Trump told a crowd of hundreds of GOP politicians and party leaders, praising "every small act of kindness, every great act of courage."
He and both of his rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, addressed a sold-out, New York Republican Party fete that sought to smooth over long-standing tensions between Mr. Trump and the state's political establishment.
Mr. Kasich, who is running a distant second in the New York polls, joked that he hoped the city would forgive his breach of local etiquette after he was pictured eating a New York slice of pizza with a knife and fork. "I'm the only candidate who beats Hillary Clinton on a consistent basis. Every time."


Guatemala's Former President Linked to New Scandal
GUATEMALA CITY—Former Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina and his then-vice president allegedly led a criminal organization that collected millions of dollars in bribes to award a contract to build a port terminal, the country's attorney general and an international anticorruption commission said Friday.
Mr. Pérez Molina signed a contract with Grupo TCQ Terminal de Contenedores Quetzal in 2013 while he was president. The Spanish company built the terminal at the Pacific coast location of Puerto Quetzal and received a 25-year concession to operate it worth $255 million, authorities said.
Mr. Pérez Molina's lawyer, Moises Galindo, said prosecutors will have to show where all the money his client allegedly received is. "I think the prosecutors are trying to build cases against my client because they can't support the first case of 'La Linea,'" Mr. Galindo said.
Mr. Pérez Molina is behind bars and faces charges of permitting and benefiting from a ring that defrauded the state of millions of dollars in the "La Linea" case. Businesses allegedly paid kickbacks to officials in exchange for lower import duties.
Mr. Pérez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti each allegedly received $4.2 million in bribes, said Ivan Velasquez, head of the U.N. commission investigating corruption in Guatemala and commonly known by its Spanish initials CICIG.


U.K. Police Given More Time to Question Terror Suspects
LONDON—British police were given more time on Saturday to question four terrorism suspects arrested as part of an investigation with French and Belgian authorities undertaken in the wake of the Paris and Brussels attacks.
The people, three unnamed men and a woman, were arrested on Thursday and Friday in raids described as "significant" by a security official. A fifth suspect was released on bail, police said Saturday.
U.K. counterterrorism officials have said they were working to establish possible links to the network that struck the French capital last November.
Police on Friday announced they had arrested five people as part of a "preplanned and intelligence-led" operation in conjunction with their French and Belgian counterparts. There was no information to suggest an attack in the U.K. was being planned, the police said.
Four of the arrests took place in Birmingham on Thursday night, while a fifth occurred at Gatwick Airport in the early hours of Friday morning. One of the suspects, a 59-year-old man arrested in Birmingham, has been released on bail while the investigation continues.


Twelve Die in Coalition Raid in Afghanistan
KABUL—Twelve people, including three children, were killed when Afghan and U.S. forces conducted a raid on the house of a suspected al Qaeda member in east Afghanistan, according to a confidential report and people familiar with the matter.
The Wall Street Journal reviewed an Afghan interior ministry incident report that detailed the early Friday operation in eastern Logar province. The report said the operation was conducted by coalition forces, a term used to refer to the U.S. force that maintains a presence in the country and works with the Afghan army. It didn't detail whether Afghan forces were present.
A U.S. coalition member said the operation was jointly conducted by Afghan and U.S. military forces. The Afghan defense ministry declined to comment.
About 9,800 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan. Most are part of an international training effort, but several thousand are part of a counterterrorism mission, the details of which haven't been disclosed
The report said the night raid targeted a suspected al Qaeda operative named Abu Abdullah. The operation took place in Kharwar district, an insurgent stronghold. Two people were seized at the house along with weapons, phones and a fake passport, the report said.


Pope's Refugee Airlift Was Last-Minute 'Inspiration'
ROME—About a week before Pope Francis' one-day trip to Lesbos, the Greek island that has borne the brunt of Europe's refugee crisis, a Vatican official approached him with an idea to bring a group of migrants stranded in Greece back to Rome with him.
"It was an inspiration..that I immediately accepted," recalled the pope during a news conference on the flight back from Lesbos on Saturday. While he was speaking, the three families of Syrian refugees, a dozen people altogether, sat in the front of the Alitalia chartered flight—the private area where the pope and his entourage travel during papal flights.
The move—in the face of a new European Union policy to deport any migrants arriving illegally in Greece back to Turkey—was among the most provocative yet from a pope who has placed migrants' rights at the center of his papacy. He has visited migrants during many international trips and celebrated Mass at the U.S.-Mexican border. He decried the call by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to build a wall along the Mexican border as "not Christian."
The pope's last-minute decision to bring migrants back with him from Lesbos set diplomats from Italy, Greece and the Vatican scrambling to find an appropriate group of refugees. In particular, they had to be among the 50,000 migrants now stranded in Greece following the March 20 migrant deal struck between the EU and Turkey. And they had to be particularly vulnerable.
The Vatican didn't distinguish on the basis of religion, the pope said. All of the dozen refugees who came to Rome are Muslim. "I didn't make a religious choice between Christians and Muslims," the pope said. "These three families had their documents in order. There were, for example, two Christian families who didn't. This is not a privilege. All 12 of them are children of God."


Brazil's Impeachment Drama
Sunday's special session of the lower house of the Brazilian Congress was a raucous affair as it met to vote on a motion to impeach President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT). She is accused of using loans from state-owned banks to cover up a budget deficit her government created in violation of the Brazilian Constitution's fiscal-responsibility law. After more than nine hours the motion won the 342 votes needed to pass.
Ms. Rousseff's defenders said that it was a purely political attack by adversaries who are as corrupt as she is. In fact, her problems go much deeper.
With a constitution that gives the government almost unlimited power to intervene in the economy, it is hardly surprising that Brazil's political system is riddled with conflicts of interest. But if this were a case of routine graft, Ms. Rousseff would likely have had success in her attempt to lure representatives from smaller parties to her side. As it stands, even if she had survived this vote, there are at least seven other impeachment petitions that will follow.
Brazil's Congress is legendary for its lack of party discipline, and only three weeks ago it was widely believed that Ms. Rousseff could defeat the impeachment motion by offering lucrative posts in her government to opposition congressmen. But she wasn't counting on the swelling wave of popular outrage against the PT machine.
This vote was a national referendum on the PT effort to bring bolivarianism—both its socialist economics and its political absolutism—to Brazil. It's why House Speaker Eduardo Cunha scheduled the session on a Sunday. The nation was watching on television as each deputy voted on camera.


Trump's Bully Pulpit
Donald Trump says he wants to unite the Republican Party, but he keeps acting as if he's mounting a hostile takeover. He's now threatening to blow up the party's July convention because he and his campaign were too lazy or inept to understand the 50 state nomination rules.
That's the story behind Mr. Trump's complaints that the party's nominating rules are "rigged" against him. "It's a crooked system. It's 100% corrupt," the front-runner howled on Sunday following a Friday op-ed on these pages making the same claims. He added on Sunday that he hopes a contested GOP convention in July "doesn't involve violence." Thanks for the warning.
Mr. Trump is upset that he's being outhustled in winning delegates, and that he may fall short of the 1,237 he needs to win a majority in July. His latest embarrassment came at the Wyoming state convention on Saturday as Ted Cruz won the 14 delegates up for grabs. Mr. Cruz was the only candidate to show up in Casper, where he added to the nine (of 12 available) delegates awarded last month at county meetings. Mr. Trump, who said he didn't want to "waste money going to Wyoming," now claims Mr. Cruz won thanks to "party bosses."
This is the same line the New Yorker leveled at the Colorado GOP, which also uses county and state conventions (rather than a popular vote) to elect delegates, and which recently awarded Mr. Cruz a delegate sweep. Yet both state processes were transparent and well known to all campaigns since last year.
In Wyoming's case, "every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has managed this process and has worked through this process and has followed the process," state GOP Chairman Matt Micheli told Fox News. Having failed to organize well enough to compete on these open terms, Mr. Trump is inventing complaints that such caucuses are "voterless."


UFC Pulls Conor McGregor From July Rematch With Nate Diaz
UFC president Dana White said that Conor McGregor has been pulled from his bout against Nate Diaz at UFC 200 on July 9 for refusing to attend a promotional news conference in Las Vegas.
In an interview with ESPN on Tuesday night, White said, "I respect Conor as a fighter and I like him as a person. But you can't decide not to show up to these things. You have to do it."
White said McGregor was in Iceland and didn't want to disrupt his training.
The UFC star had earlier prompted retirement speculation after a tweet on his verified Twitter account. "I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later."
The 27-year old McGregor (19-3) had been scheduled to fight Diaz in a rematch of a March bout, when Diaz beat McGregor via a second-round submission at UFC 196.


Rikers Curbs Use of Solitary Confinement
The number of inmates held in solitary confinement on New York City's Rikers Island has fallen sharply, in what city officials say is a sign of a gradual turnaround at a jail complex marred by allegations of violence and abuse.
The average percentage of Rikers inmates in punitive segregation, commonly known as solitary confinement, fell from 7.3% in 2012, a recent peak, to 2.3% last year, according to the city's Department of Correction. At the beginning of April, there were 167 inmates in solitary confinement, or 1.7% of the city's total inmate population.
City officials attribute the decline to several factors, from banning such punishment for younger inmates to introducing less-punitive options for inmates who misbehave.
"We don't need to take out the sledgehammer in order to get compliance," said Joseph Ponte, commissioner of the city's correction department.
People in solitary—called the Bing by some at Rikers—are generally confined to their cells for 23 hours each day. Inmates are placed in solitary because of behavior within the jail, not for crimes committed outside of it.


Donald Trump's Path
'We don't have much of a race anymore," declared Donald Trump in his Tuesday night victory speech, with his familiar understatement. He knows that's not true, and that he could still lose the nomination at the GOP convention, but John Kasich or Ted Cruz are going to have to do more than steal delegates to stop him now. They have to coordinate and win some states.
Some of the "Never Trump" crowd are claiming that New York changed nothing in the race, but that is wishful thinking. Mr. Trump won at least 89 of the 95 available delegates and all but one of 27 congressional districts. (He lost the East Side of Manhattan.) He barely passed the 50% threshold in more than a dozen counties, but that only underscores the mistake his opponents made in conceding the businessman's home state. They could have denied him more delegates with even a modicum of advertising in Albany, Buffalo or elsewhere.
The blowout victory erases the memory of Mr. Trump's defeat in Wisconsin two weeks ago and propels him into next week's contests in five mid-Atlantic and New England states. Mr. Trump is leading in the polls in all of those states, and without more concerted opposition he'll sweep those too.
New York was especially cruel to Mr. Cruz, whose third place finish with 14.5% underscored his lack of appeal to less conservative voters. He failed to carry a single county, as New Yorkers repaid him for his gibe in Iowa against "New York values." Can Republicans finally retire the Sarah Palin trope that Americans in certain zip codes aren't real Americans?
Mr. Cruz would do best now to leave next week's eastern contests to Mr. Kasich and focus on Indiana May 3, Nebraska May 10, and California June 7. With its winner-take-all rules, Indiana is now make-or-break for the Texan—and maybe for Mr. Trump too. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a stalwart conservative running for re-election this year, will have an excruciating decision to make on whether to endorse a candidate or stay neutral. He'll make some Republicans unhappy either way.


Merkel's Turkey Visit Will Focus on Refugees
GAZIANTEP, Turkey—Turkish leaders prepared to welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday to showcase Turkey's support for Syrian refugees, even as human-rights groups say Ankara is making it harder and more dangerous for people to escape the fighting.
While Turkey officially welcomes all Syrians trying to flee the five-year war, in practice the country is using increasingly tough methods to turn away thousands seeking sanctuary, they say.
"The Turkey-Syrian border is a gray zone," said Metin Corabatir, a former U.N. official in Turkey who now serves as director of IGAM, an Ankara-based immigration think tank. "But in practice, the open-door policy has ended."
Turkish border guards, tasked with preventing Islamic State militants from sneaking in and out of Syria, now detain, beat and shoot at people trying to get into Turkey, Syrians at the border and international human-rights watchdogs say.
Turkish leaders say border guards never fire on civilians, but an official in Ankara said the guards do fire warning shots.


Obama, Cameron and the Day of the 'Remains'
London
The debate about whether Britain should remain in the European Union or leave ("Brexit") took a dramatic turn Friday when President Obama broke off from wishing Queen Elizabeth II a happy 90th birthday to lecture the British people about how to vote in the EU referendum on June 23.
In a joint news conference with Prime Minister David Cameron, who has staked his political future on Britain's voting "Remain" rather than "Leave," Mr. Obama was full of surprises.
For one thing, he admitted that it had been his call to remove the bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office when he first became president. That was a jaw-dropper, because until now the White House has maintained that the decision was taken before Mr. Obama took up residence and was no reflection on the president's attitude toward Britain or its "special relationship" with the United States. Only a month ago, Ted Cruz was accused of "lying" when he repeated this story. So it was good of the president to clear that up, although unlikely to endear him to his British audience.
The biggest shock, though, was his affirmation of something the pro-EU camp has been claiming and which is usually dismissed as typical of "Project Fear"—the disparaging name the Leave side has given to the Remain campaign. Earlier this week, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Cameron's closest ally, claimed that Brexit would cost each British family £4,300 ($6,200), a figure written off by his opponents as scaremongering.


Islamist Militants in Philippines Behead Canadian Hostage
MANILA—Islamist militants in the southern Philippines beheaded Canadian hostage John Ridsdel on Monday, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed.
The Abu Sayyaf group, a small extremist organization with ties to Islamic State that specializes in taking hostages for ransom, had demanded payment of 300 million pesos, of about $6.4 million, each for Mr. Ridsdel and two other hostages, one Canadian and one Norwegian. The hostages were snatched from a resort in the southern Philippines in September. The extremist group had threatened to kill one of the hostages if they didn't receive the ransom money by 3 p.m. on Monday.
"I am outraged by the news that a Canadian citizen, John Ridsdel, held hostage in the Philippines since September 21, 2015, has been killed at the hands of his captors," Mr. Trudeau said in a statement released Monday.
"Canada condemns without reservation the brutality of the hostage-takers, and this unnecessary death. This was an act of coldblooded murder and responsibility rests squarely with the terrorist group who took him hostage."
Local police said they found a severed head in Jolo in Sulu, the island province in the Philippines' deep south, a predominantly Muslim area where Abu Sayyaf operates from a handful of jungle bases. Mr. Ridsdel worked in the Philippines as a mining consultant.


Supreme Court Looks Likely to Throw Out Ex-Governor's Conviction
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared likely Wednesday to throw out former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's corruption conviction, with justices across the ideological spectrum raising concerns that the government's concept of bribery was so broad as to criminalize many routine actions by public officials.
"We're worried..because, like any other organization, the prosecutors, too, can be overly zealous," Justice Stephen Breyer said at an oral argument in the case. He and other justices said they feared the government's legal theory potentially could make a congressman a criminal if he accepted lunch from a constituent and then sent a letter on his behalf.
The lingering question was less whether Mr. McDonnell's conviction would survive, but if the court's ultimate decision would provide federal prosecutors enough guidance to revise their charges and potentially retry the former governor.
Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, was convicted after leaving office in 2014 on 11 corruption counts after he and his wife, Maureen, accepted more than $177,000 in personal loans and gifts from Star Scientific Inc. Chief Executive Jonnie Williams Jr. Mr. Williams wanted the governor to push state university researchers to produce studies that could help secure Food and Drug Administration approval for the dietary supplement Anatabloc.
Mr. McDonnell made phone calls and arranged meetings on Mr. Williams's behalf, but he stopped short of directing state officials to undertake the studies. His appeal contended that such favors reflected the type of ingratiation and access a politician's financial patrons are entitled to receive under Supreme Court precedents such as Citizens United, the 2010 campaign-finance case.


South Africa Opposition Says President Should Step Down
JOHANNESBURG—Fiery South African opposition politician Julius Malema told 40,000 cheering supporters that President Jacob Zuma should step down before the army turns on him because of the corruption allegations against him.
"I am whispering to you, Zuma, wherever you are, those soldiers are going to turn their guns against you," Mr. Malema said to roars from the crowd. "Be warned, leave office before the soldiers turn their guns on you."
Mr. Malema spoke Saturday to supporters of his Economic Freedom Fighters party who filled the Orlando Stadium in Soweto. He described the policies of his party ahead of local government elections, which will take place in August this year.
Mr. Malema promised to give priority to South Africa's poor if his party is elected to government and said the country then will truly belong to the country's black majority. He said many members of South Africa's current parliament are "agents of apartheid," referring to the country's former policy of racial discrimination.
Mr. Malema dismissed the treason charges pressed against him earlier this week by the ruling African National Congress. The ANC filed the charges after Mr. Malema said he would take up arms against the government if he saw rigging in the elections. He challenged the government to arrest him.


Sumner Redstone Drama Heads to Court Climax
The legal battle over media mogul Sumner Redstone's mental competence, which finally heads to court this week after transfixing Hollywood and Wall Street for months, features a cast of characters befitting a reality TV show.
Besides Mr. Redstone, the 92-year-old chairman emeritus and controlling shareholder of Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. , there is his much younger ex-girlfriend-turned-companion, a once-estranged daughter, an unpredictable granddaughter, an embattled chief executive and a nurse who wields unusual power in Mr. Redstone's Beverly Park mansion because he interprets the ailing billionaire's extremely impaired speech.
The dispute, which centers on Mr. Redstone's former companion Manuela Herzer's claim that he was mentally incompetent last October when he removed her as his health-care agent, is heading toward its final episode. The Herzer versus Redstone trial begins on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, unless a last-minute settlement is reached. A deal seemed close last month but talks fell apart. Ms. Herzer's lead counsel, Pierce O'Donnell, said in late April that "we're going to trial."
In the six months since the suit was filed, court documents have aired salacious details of Mr. Redstone's alleged mental and physical state, family disputes, business relationships and wealth. At the heart of the case are serious questions about an elderly man's ability to make decisions, a fight over inheritances and the control over more than $40 billion of media assets.
If the judge rules that Mr. Redstone did indeed lack mental capacity, it could have implications for the fate of his media empire, which today spans such household names as MTV, CBS and Paramount Pictures. Legal experts say such a ruling would put pressure on Mr. Redstone's associates to trigger the trust that he set up years ago to take control of his 80% voting stakes in Viacom and CBS. The stakes are held by his company National Amusements Inc.


Connecticut's Malloy Will Sign Gun Bill
Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said he would sign a bill approved Monday by state lawmakers that requires people subject to temporary civil restraining orders to give up their guns.
"We have a moral obligation to work to prevent needless tragedy and to make this the law," Mr. Malloy said.
The Senate passed the bill 23 to 13. The House of Representatives passed the bill on Wednesday.
It is the Legislature's latest action to strengthen gun laws following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
The law's supporters say it would give additional protection to domestic-violence victims. Gun-rights advocates say it would infringe on the due-process rights of people falsely accused of crimes.


Trump Win Just Latest Tremor Shaking GOP
At the dawn of the current presidential campaign—when Republican leaders were thrilled to have an A-team of reliably conservative candidates on the field, when they had a game plan for a quick and orderly nomination process, and when they were giddy at the prospect of facing a flawed Democratic candidate carrying years' worth of baggage—nobody could have seen the primary-season climax that arrived Tuesday.
Donald Trump, who was something between a curiosity and an after-thought at the outset, won the Indiana primary, a victory quickly followed by the withdrawal of his last serious opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, from the race. Mr. Trump now will be the Republican nominee for president—the most unexpected outcome of a primary contest since Jimmy Carter emerged from obscurity to win the Democratic nomination four decades ago.
Mr. Trump reached that milestone on a day of striking ugliness, when he essentially accused Mr. Cruz's father of cavorting with a presidential assassin, and Mr. Cruz in return called Mr. Trump a "pathological liar" a "narcissist" and a "serial philanderer." The Democrats' attack ads for the fall are practically writing themselves.
All told, the day offered merely the latest in a string of once-unimaginable tremors that have shaken the system and the Republican Party. Nobody—party leaders, journalists, fellow candidates, even Mr. Trump himself—foresaw what has transpired.
The Democrats are shaken and shaking, too, of course. Hillary Clinton's weak showing in Indiana, along with a series of other recent states, is further evidence that the Democratic Party's initial story line—which was supposed to be one of Clinton inevitability and ease of nomination—was no closer to accurate.


London Elects First Muslim Mayor
LONDON—Sadiq Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants to the U.K., became the capital's next mayor, in a win that marked a bright spot for the main opposition Labour Party after it suffered losses in other local elections.
Mr. Khan, who became the city's first Muslim mayor, won by a wide margin, receiving more than 1.3 million votes, while Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith received 994,614 votes, when counting second-choice preferences.
The campaign had in recent weeks turned bitter. Mr. Goldsmith, the son of a billionaire, had repeatedly accused Mr. Khan, whose father was a bus driver, of being too soft on extremism and questioned his judgment for having appeared at public events alongside people with extremist views. The tactic appeared to backfire, with some Londoners saying they were turned off by the personal attacks on Mr. Khan.
Mr. Khan has said he has represented some unsavory figures through his former career as a human-rights lawyer and said he has spent years fighting extremism.
In a speech just after midnight, Mr. Khan said he promised to be a mayor for all Londoners, regardless of their backgrounds.


Ferguson Gets First Permanent Black Police Chief
FERGUSON, Mo.—The embattled police force here officially has a new chief.
Delrish Moss was sworn in Monday, becoming the first permanent black chief in the St. Louis suburb where 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, was fatally shot by a white officer in 2014. The officer wasn't charged, but the shooting was a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.
Mr. Moss spent his entire 32-year career with Miami police and planned to retire in September. He has said he hopes to diversify the mostly white department as it rebounds from the 2014 shooting.
Mr. Moss succeeds Tom Jackson, who resigned in March 2015 following a Justice Department report critical of Ferguson.

Navy Officer Fired From Post Over Iran's Detention of U.S. Sailors
WASHINGTON—The U.S. Navy officer in charge of 10 American sailors who were detained by Iranian authorities earlier this year was dismissed from his post by officials who cited a loss of confidence in his ability to command.
Cmdr. Eric Rasch had been relieved of his duties after a preliminary investigation into the Jan. 12 incident, in which 10 sailors crossed into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf, the Navy said in a statement.
The incident sparked an international fracas that came during sensitive negotiations between Washington and Tehran over the Iranian nuclear program and prompted puzzlement among military officials in the U.S. over how the crew could have made such a mistake.
Cmdr. Rasch was the head of the U.S. Navy's Coastal Riverine Squadron 3 when its sailors ended up in Iranian captivity. He has been temporarily reassigned to another squadron, the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command said in the statement Thursday.
Cmdr. Rasch didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. His dismissal is the first public disciplinary action to stem from the January incident.


ATMs Come to Courthouses to Help Defendants Make Bail
ATMs are coming to criminal courthouses in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx as soon as next week to solve a basic problem—access to cash to pay bail.
Defendants who can't immediately post bail are typically sent to the Rikers Island jail complex to await trial. But currently only the courthouses in Manhattan and Staten Island have ATMs, officials said.
"If you're able to pay it at the courthouse, you won't get on the bus, and you'll go free that day," said Alex Crohn, general counsel for the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice.
About 17,000 people a year pay bail after they are sent to Rikers, city officials say. Of this number, 77% are able to pay bail within a week. Such numbers suggest these people can afford bail, and the problem is payment logistics, officials said.
For many defendants, the time immediately after arrest brings unexpected complications. Initial appearances in court, called arraignments, typically happen from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m.


U.S. Sees Rising Risk of Coup in Venezuela
WASHINGTON—Venezuela is descending into a deepening crisis that could end in violence, including the possibility of a coup against that country's embattled leftist government, senior U.S. intelligence officials said Friday.
There is a "potential for real violence," one of two officials said in a briefing with a small group of reporters. "It's hard for me to see how this ends easily."
The officials, who have extensive experience in the region, said that they and others in the intelligence community increasingly believe that President Nicolás Maduro could be removed from office, either in a "palace coup" led by associates close to him or in a military uprising. They said that the possibility of an overthrow or street violence is of concern to American officials, who want to avoid anarchy in an oil-rich country just a three-hour flight from Miami.
"The goal is to mitigate the crisis that they're experiencing," said the official. "It's in the United States' interest that Venezuela not bottom out."
He said, however, that Washington's options are limited because of Mr. Maduro's antipathy toward the U.S., which he frequently blames for orchestrating "an economic war" designed to destabilize his government.


Eight Dead in South Texas Bus Crash
LAREDO, Texas—A charter bus headed to a casino crashed in far South Texas on Saturday, killing eight people and injuring 44 others in a one-vehicle rollover, officials said.
Seven people died at the scene on U.S. Highway 83 about 46 miles north of Laredo and another died later at a Laredo hospital, Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Conrad Hein said.
"The driver of the bus lost control and rolled over," he said. "Everything's real preliminary right now."
The driver was among the survivors, Mr. Hein said.
It was raining Saturday morning but it was uncertain if that was a factor in the crash that occurred just before 11:30 a.m., the trooper said. No other vehicles were in the area at the time, Mr. Hein said.


Baltimore Trial Draws Attention of Police Nationwide
BALTIMORE—Police across the U.S. are closely monitoring the trial of a Baltimore officer charged with assault for his role in the arrest of Freddie Gray on the day last year Mr. Gray sustained fatal injuries in police custody.
"With all the antipolice rhetoric going around the country, everybody is convinced they're going to be the next officer that is going to be armchair quarterbacked on making a split-second decision," said Chuck Canterbury, president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing 335,000 officers nationwide.
Prosecutors charged Officer Edward Nero with second-degree assault, contending he and fellow officers illegally arrested Mr. Gray before the 25-year-old sustained a fatal broken neck while in the back of a police van. Mr. Nero is one of six officers charged in connection with Mr. Gray's death in April 2015.
Mr. Nero, 30, is also charged with reckless endangerment for failing to seat-belt Mr. Gray in the police van and with misconduct. Other charges against some officers include manslaughter and second-degree murder. All have pleaded not guilty and await trial. The trial of one officer ended in a hung jury.
"To say an officer illegally arrested him and therefore assaulted him is a stretch," Mr. Canterbury said, referring to Mr. Gray's arrest.


NYU President Aims to Balance
New York University's president Andrew Hamilton had been on the job for four months when he faced his first student uprising.
For about 33 hours, undergraduates calling for the school to divest its holdings in fossil-fuel companies crammed into an elevator that leads to his office. They eventually struck a deal with administrators and later met with Mr. Hamilton himself.
"Nothing has really changed since he's been here," said Olivia Rich, one of the student protesters, "but we're willing to give him a chance."
Occupy Elevator is but one of the challenges the chemistry professor faced in his first semester at NYU, where he emerged from a field of some 200 candidates to lead the Greenwich Village-based school and its more than 50,000 students.
A Briton who previously served as the University of Oxford's vice chancellor, Mr. Hamilton in January succeeded John Sexton, NYU's president for 14 years. Mr. Sexton led the school during a period in which it expanded both locally and overseas, drawing criticism at times. Area residents sued to stop its plans, students protested its rising costs, and some faculty members in 2013 issued a no-confidence vote against him.


Deadly Cyclone Batters Southern Bangladesh
DHAKA, Bangladesh—A cyclone unleashed heavy rain and strong winds on Bangladesh's southern coastal region on Saturday, killing at least 11 people and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Local media say the deaths were caused by the collapse of houses in the Bhola, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Patuakhali districts.
The cyclone, named Roanu, crossed the Cox's Bazar and weakened after triggering rains. The meteorological office said dozens of villages had been submerged by floodwaters.
Mohammed Ali Hossain, a government administrator, said about 100,000 people were forced from their homes on Moheshkhali island in Cox's Bazar. "Our teams are working there. We are arranging dry food for them and other resources they need urgently," he said.
Mohammed Ullah, a local council chief, said the island was flooded quickly by the cyclone. "The islanders were preparing to go to cyclone shelters following a forecast that the cyclone was expected to hit in the afternoon or in the evening, but suddenly waters started coming. Most islanders have moved to safety," he said.


U.S. Military Wants More Leeway to Strike Taliban
WASHINGTON—The death of the Taliban's leader in a U.S. drone strike has scrambled discussions between the U.S. military and the White House over whether to let U.S. forces once again conduct offensive operations against the insurgent group in Afghanistan.
The American military wants presidential permission to use airpower to blunt the group's threatened advances this summer, according to several U.S. officials. The White House first wants to see what effect the death of Mullah Akhtar Mansour in Pakistan over the weekend will have on the Taliban, senior administration officials said.
President Barack Obama confirmed Mr. Mansour's death on Monday. The death came amid indications of an impending Taliban offensive.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been warning the White House that the Taliban could seize more Afghan territory, including population centers, during this summer's fighting season, in part because the Afghan government and its military forces are so weak.
Fearing a Taliban surge, military officials want to use American aircraft to counter the group this summer, the U.S. officials said.


Hit the Taliban Harder
The death by drone over the weekend of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour is a welcome event in what used to be called the war on terror, and all the more so if it represents a change in President Obama's military tactics in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama needs to escalate U.S. bombing to prevent Taliban gains that could leave his successor with another security crisis to clean up.
The White House says Mr. Obama signed off on the attack on Mansour, who took over the Taliban after the death of Mullah Omar nearly three years ago. The Pentagon carried out the attack when intelligence offered the opportunity. Also encouraging is that Mansour was killed in Baluchistan, inside Pakistan, where so many Taliban leaders hide as they plan attacks in Afghanistan.
Pakistan's foreign ministry protested the drone strike, albeit without its usual efflorescence. It isn't clear if the U.S. informed Pakistan before the strike, but no matter. With the exception of the Osama bin Laden raid, the Bush and Obama administrations failed to challenge the Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.
Mansour "was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I've set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there," Mr. Obama said Monday. "So this does not represent a shift in our approach. We are not re-entering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces."
But U.S. ground forces don't have to re-engage to make more military progress. As David Petraeus and Michael O'Hanlon wrote on these pages Saturday, what's needed is more vigorous bombing in support of Afghan security forces. U.S. rules of engagement are so restrictive—and limited to al Qaeda or Islamic State fighters—that the Taliban can attack Afghan forces and then retreat to safety without risk of bombardment. "The rules of engagement mean that the indigenous Afghan and Pakistani Taliban generally get a pass," the two strategists wrote.


Washington's Chicken Retreat
Victories against the Obama regulatory juggernaut are rare, and thus all the more worthy of note. Congratulations, then, to Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt and Republicans in Congress over the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision on May 10 to drop its quest to list the lesser prairie chicken as an endangered species.
Fish and Wildlife's decision in 2014 to list was never about helping that particular range bird. It was part of an attempted federal land grab by green activists. Using a strategy called "sue and settle," these groups propose species for protected status under the Endangered Species Act, then sue the Obama Administration to follow through. The agency then settles the suits on terms that the greens want.
Their goal in the case of the prairie chicken was to impose development restrictions on private landowners in five western states. Because the prairie chicken's range is so wide, the greens hoped to shut down oil and gas drilling in much of the West, especially and around the fossil-fuel rich Permian Basin.
Mr. Pruitt (joined by four other states) sued, arguing that Fish and Wildlife had ignored years of cooperation between states and landowners to develop a voluntary and successful plan for conservation. Federal Judge Robert Junell agreed in September and vacated the listing, and the Administration has now decided not to appeal. House Republicans also fought the illegal listing with policy riders to spending bills.
The biggest beneficiary is the prairie chicken, which has a far better chance of revival under cooperative private stewardship than it does under the coercive methods of a federal bureaucracy.


Hispanic Support Eludes Donald Trump
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—Donald Trump's criticism of the nation's first Latina governor threatens to further damage his image in the Hispanic community as he turns toward a general election where those voters will be pivotal.
At a rally in Albuquerque on Tuesday night, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee pointed to a rise in food stamp recipients under New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who heads the Republican Governors Association. "She's gotta do a better job," he said.
On Wednesday in Southern California, Mr. Trump invoked the name of a San Francisco woman killed last year by an illegal immigrant. "Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!'' the crowd chanted.
Mr. Trump's appearances in two of the three states with the largest Hispanic electorates follow a few initial overtures to Hispanic voters in recent weeks that have drawn mixed results. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates a record 27.3 million Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016 and would make up about 12% of the electorate, up from 10% in 2012.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't respond to questions about whether he planned to hire campaign staffers focused on Hispanic outreach to improve his large deficit with that group in polls.


U.N. Will Request Syrian Permission for Aid Airdrops
UNITED NATIONS—The United Nations said it will seek Syria's permission to conduct air drops of humanitarian aid to more than a dozen besieged areas of the country because the regime repeatedly was denying full access by land to convoys carrying food, medical and other emergency supplies.
The announcement Friday at an emergency meeting of the Security Council came after a June 1 deadline set by a group of countries that support the Syrian peace process passed without notable improvement in aid deliveries.
On Friday, an expected delivery of emergency food aid to the rebel-held town of Daraya didn't arrive, dashing the hopes of thousands of hungry and malnourished civilians in the Damascus suburb.
Western diplomats said the air-drops proposal is intended to raise pressure on the government of President Bashar al-Assad to allow the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas of the country.
"The more pressure the more chance we have to get results," French Ambassador François Delattre said after the Security Council meeting.


CDC Identifies Counties at Risk of HIV Outbreaks
AUSTIN, Ind.—In this rural town, the forces of poverty and addiction drove a needle-sharing drug problem that caused the first-known HIV outbreak related to the current opioid crisis in America.
Now, as Austin struggles to recover from its outbreak last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified 220 counties across the U.S. where similar conditions create vulnerability to eruptions of HIV and hepatitis C.
At last count, 194 people were infected, almost all in Scott County, where Austin is. The lifetime cost of treating the HIV patients, as well as those with hepatitis C, could approach $100 million, the CDC estimates. At that rate, the total price tag for treating similar rashes in even just a fraction of the flagged counties could surpass $1 billion. "You can see this coming at you double-barreled," said Judith Feinberg, a professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine.
The HIV outbreak here—which started in December 2014 and tapered off last summer—strained the public-health system and highlighted the potential threat confronting other rural areas overrun by heroin and prescription painkillers.
To find counties most vulnerable to an outbreak of HIV or hepatitis C, researchers analyzed factors including pharmacy sales of prescription painkillers, overdose deaths and unemployment rates.


Supporters of Brazil's Rousseff Protest Temer Government
SÃO PAULO—Brazilians backing suspended President Dilma Rousseff took to the streets of some of the country's biggest cities on Friday to protest against the interim government of acting President Michel Temer, in the first big event organized to try to help Ms. Rousseff return to office.
Police didn't have an initial estimate for the size of the crowds, but in São Paulo, people thronged several city blocks around the São Paulo Museum of Art on the city's broad Paulista Avenue.
Ms. Rousseff stepped aside in mid-May after Brazil's Senate voted to hold an impeachment trial against her on charges her government violated budget laws to hide a growing budget deficit. She has denied the accusations and called the effort to impeach her an attempted coup d'état by Mr. Temer and his allies.
Many people in the crowd in São Paulo were wearing red, holding anti-Temer signs, and carrying Brazilian and trade-union flags as they listened to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff's mentor and predecessor, call for Mr. Temer to leave.
"Temer, what you did was wrong, and as a great constitutionalist, you know it's wrong," Mr. da Silva told the cheering crowd. "Return power to the people, to Dilma."


Continental Divide: 'Brexit' Vote Splits British Political Duo
LONDON—British Prime Minister David Cameron and former London Mayor Boris Johnson have a lot in common. Two years apart in age, they attended the same boarding school, the same university, then entered Parliament together. Their odd-couple alliance—Mr. Cameron is refined and on message, Mr. Johnson, tousled and hip-shooting—helped their Conservative Party last year win its first general election in more than two decades.
Thirteen months later, they are at each other's throats. The reason is Britain's divisive June 23 referendum on whether it should remain a member of the European Union.
Mr. Cameron, 49 years old, is spearheading the push to persuade Britons to vote to remain, asserting that Britain would face economic peril if it detached from Europe. Mr. Johnson, 51, is leading the campaign to exit, or so-called Brexit, with a sharp-tongued assault on Brussels, which he says saps Britain's sovereignty and burdens it with regulation.
Their rivalry flared in February, when Mr. Johnson informed his longtime friend and party leader Mr. Cameron, by text message moments before making his decision public, that he would support the exit campaign. Since then, both men have infused their campaign rhetoric with barbs about one another.
Mr. Johnson attacked Mr. Cameron's case for staying in the EU as "baloney" and dismissed the prime minister's monthslong negotiation to secure concessions from other EU leaders as having achieved "two-thirds of diddly squat."


Stop-Trump Groups Fail to Get Traction
Donald Trump has been the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for more than a month, yet his inability to unify party leaders and his widely condemned assertions about a federal judge's Mexican ethnicity are fueling efforts to dislodge him at the GOP's July national convention.
The two functioning stop-Trump groups remain small and have no funding behind them. One is composed of a handful of Washington-based operatives, attorneys and media personalities. The other is a coalition of about 15 convention delegates from Colorado who are trying to gather support for a rule that would unbind delegates who are now mandated by various state-party rules to back Mr. Trump for the nomination.
Yet time, distance and disorganization are likely to render them ineffective, as the rest of the Republican Party, some with equal trepidation about Mr. Trump, steadily move toward the nomination of the New York businessman.
Mr. Trump mocked his detractors at a Friday rally in Richmond, Va. "I hear these poor, sad people, 'Never Trump,' they're still going, 'Never Trump, never Trump.' These poor guys," he said. "They've been doing this for months."
Officials in the Washington-based group said last week they didn't know about their Colorado counterparts. The leader of the Colorado group said she would like to be in touch with conservative radio hosts like Hugh Hewitt and Erick Erickson leading the Washington stop-Trump effort but doesn't know how.


Police Weighed Deadly Risks in Orlando Hostage Dilemma
ORLANDO, Fla.—Police broke down a fence that enclosed the patio of Pulse around 2:15 a.m. Sunday as Ivory McNeal slipped from his hiding place behind the potted plants. "Please don't shoot!" he said.
Minutes earlier, a man identified by authorities as Omar Mateen had exchanged gunfire with the uniformed police officer stationed at the club to gain entrance. "All the music stopped immediately," said Mr. McNeal, who was standing near the main bar. "The gunshots just kept going, kept going..people starting to fall on the ground, people running."
More police arrived and traded shots with Mateen, forcing him to halt his deadly rampage and retreat into one of the nightclub's bathrooms. There he held four or five hostages, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Another 15 to 20 people were hiding in another bathroom. By then, dozens of dead and injured covered the floor of the gay nightclub.
In the hours that followed, authorities tried negotiating with the gunman, who threatened the hostages and hinted of carrying explosives. They had to weigh the risk to officers and captives in a forced entry against the needs of the injured and the risk of giving the attacker more time to kill.
"If you have a case where a person is ready to die, wants to die, then it makes an enormous challenge for negotiations to be effective," said Gary Noesner, the former chief negotiator for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, now retired.


French Police Officer Stabbed to Death
PARIS—A knife-wielding attacker stabbed a senior police officer to death Monday evening outside his home in a distant suburb of Paris, officials said. The attacker and a female companion of the police commander were later found dead after police stormed the home and rescued the couple's three-year-old son.
French officials said anti-terrorism prosecutors were investigating the attack. The Islamic State's Amaq news agency cited an unnamed source as saying an IS fighter carried out the attack, but the extremist jihadist group has not officially claimed responsibility.
The off-duty police commander was stabbed to death outside his home in Magnanville, about 35 miles west of Paris, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene. The attacker then retreated indoors. After a roughly three-hour standoff, police stormed the residence. Mr. Brandet said the woman and the attacker were found dead. The couple's son was unharmed.
Although officials said the attacker was killed by police when they stormed the residence, it was unclear how the woman was killed.
The Paris prosecutor's office said early Tuesday that anti-terrorism investigators had been brought in to the case given the target, the method behind the attack, and what the attacker said to police during the ensuing standoff. The office did not elaborate.


Democrats Press Swing-State GOP Senators on Gun Bill
WASHINGTON—The national debate over how to respond to the Orlando, Fla., mass shooting spilled into the election-year battle for control of the Senate Tuesday, with Democratic candidates pressing Republican incumbents over legislation aimed at restricting suspected terrorists' access to weapons.
Lawmakers in both parties want to give the Justice Department the power to intervene if someone on terror watch lists tries to buy a gun, but they diverge on the process and how much evidence of suspicious activity is needed to block the sale.
While some lawmakers called for striking a compromise, there was little evidence Tuesday of any talks. The hardening political fight over gun access elevated the issue in the handful of tight Senate races in swing states that will determine which party controls the chamber next year.
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senate nominee Katie McGinty held a news conference at Philadelphia's City Hall highlighting GOP Sen. Pat Toomey's opposition late last year to the bill from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.).
The legislation would give the Justice Department authority to prevent a known or suspected terrorist from buying firearms or explosives if authorities have a reasonable belief the weapon could be used in connection with terrorism. Someone who meets that criteria is likely to be on one of the federal terrorism watch lists, including the no-fly list. All but one Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, opposed the measure when the Senate voted on it in December.


L.A. May See Summer Blackouts
California regulators and utility executives are staring down a natural-gas shortage in the Los Angeles area that could trigger up to two weeks of electrical blackouts this summer.
The state's electric grid operator warned Friday that it may call for emergency reductions in electricity use on Monday and Tuesday, when a heat wave in Southern California is expected to push up demand for air conditioning. Without conservation, officials fear power plants could run out of fuel and trigger rolling blackouts.
Though the U.S. is awash in natural gas, the L.A. region is short of the fuel due to the massive gas leak last winter at the state's largest underground gas-storage facility, Aliso Canyon, an event that displaced thousands of people in the nearby Porter Ranch neighborhood.
Southern California is vulnerable to energy disruptions because it relies on a complex web of electric transmission lines, gas pipelines and gas storage facilities—all running like clockwork—to get enough electricity. If any piece is disabled, it can mean electricity shortages. Gas is the state's chief fuel for power generation, not coal.
But the pipelines can only bring in about 3 billion cubic feet of working gas a day into Southern California, below the daily demand, which gets as high as 5.7 billion cubic feet.


A Gay Officer Caught Between Two Worlds
Brian Downey says he was destroyed.
It was a day after the mass shooting in Orlando and the detective was walking away from a vigil where his boss, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton, spoke to a crowd of mourners outside of the Stonewall Inn. As Mr. Bratton spoke at the historic gay bar, some in the crowd chanted, "You kill people."
"That vigil was not an accurate portrayal of who the [gay] community is," Detective Downey said. He added, "The police commissioner is not a killer and I'm not a killer."
The massacre of 49 people in an Orlando nightclub earlier this month awakened what some say are longstanding tensions between the New York Police Department and members of the city's gay community.
Detective Downey, an openly gay member of the NYPD and the force's primary liaison to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, was thrust into the middle of the acrimony. In the span of 24 hours, the 36-year-old went from celebrating his ties to both worlds to scrambling to keep them together.


New York City Passes 'Menstrual Equity' Bill
The New York City Council on Tuesday voted 49-0 to approve legislation to provide free feminine hygiene products to students in the city's public schools, homeless women living in shelters and women in jails.
Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a Queens Democrat and a sponsor of the legislation, called the measure an issue of "menstrual equity."
"Periods have been stigmatized for far too long," Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said.
On another matter, lawmakers agreed to delay implementation of a new law that would require a 5-cent fee on paper and plastic bags at most stores in the five boroughs.
The law had been scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, but the council voted Tuesday to push back the effective date to Feb. 15, 2017.


Obama's Fracking Comeuppance
Another day, another judicial rebuke to President Obama's contempt for the rule of law. On Wednesday a federal judge struck down an oil and gas drilling rule imposed with no statutory authority.
In 2015 the Bureau of Land Management published new regulations about well construction and water management for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that takes place on federal and Indian lands. The BLM asserted "broad authority" to control oil and gas operations on the basis of laws that were passed in 1920, 1930, 1938, 1976 and 1982 and were allegedly ambiguous. Thus the agency said it deserved the benefit of the interpretive doubt that the courts call Chevron deference.
Abusing Chevron is an Obama specialty. But BLM's overreach was notably egregious because Congress passed an energy law in 2005 that stripped the executive branch of fracking jurisdiction and gave that power to the states.
The BLM argued that Congress's choice didn't matter because the bureau wasn't mentioned by name in the 2005 law. That claim inspired Judge Scott Skavdahl of Wyoming—an Obama appointee—to conduct a remedial seminar in the Constitution's separation of powers.
Under the BLM argument, Judge Skavdahl writes, "there would be no limit to the scope or extent of congressionally delegated authority BLM has. . . . Having explicitly removed the only source of specific federal agency authority over fracking, it defies common sense for the BLM to argue that Congress intended to allow it to regulate the same activity under a general statute that says nothing about hydraulic fracturing."


Chinese, Russian Presidents Criticize West After Summit
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Western actions that weaken global "strategic stability" and infringe on Beijing's and Moscow's interests in joint statements that followed a one-day bilateral meeting in Beijing on Saturday.
The statements outlined Chinese and Russian consensus on a range of global military, economic and diplomatic issues, and underscored a deepening partnership between Beijing and Moscow against their geopolitical rivals in the West.
Russia has drawn closer to China following Western sanctions imposed in 2014 over Moscow's actions against Ukraine, and Beijing abstained from a U.N. General Assembly vote that called on nations not to recognize the annexation of Crimea. Analysts say China may seek some Russian reciprocation given Beijing's own diplomatic difficulties in recent weeks.
In the Saturday statements, China and Russia appeared to offered each other diplomatic backing over issues where they have faced major strategic differences with the U.S. and other Western governments. Messrs. Xi and Putin expressed concern over growing "negative factors" affecting "global strategic stability," and urged respect for international law as well as "the legitimate rights and interests" of all countries in the handling of global and regional tensions.
Both leaders criticized Western efforts enhancing ballistic-missile defense in Europe and northeast Asia, saying they "severely infringe upon the strategic security interests" of other countries in the region. They expressed joint opposition to the deployment of the Aegis Ashore system in Europe -- a concern to Moscow—and the proposed placement of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, which Beijing has condemned.


'Brexit' Sparks Political Turmoil Across U.K.
LONDON—The U.K.'s vote to quit the European Union threw the country's political establishment into a tailspin, ensnaring its two main parties in leadership battles and fostering greater uncertainty over how Britain would disentangle itself from the bloc.
The ruling Conservative Party is grappling with a political vacuum on Downing Street after Prime Minister David Cameron's decision Friday to step down in a few months. Senior politicians in the opposition Labour Party, meanwhile, led an open revolt against their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, over the weekend. Nearly a dozen members of his shadow cabinet either resigned or were fired as they voiced opposition to his leadership, though Mr. Corbyn vowed to fight off any coup attempt.
Adding to the unfolding political crisis, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged to protect Scotland's place in the EU by holding another referendum on its secession from the U.K., if necessary. She also threatened to block Britain's exit from the EU, arguing that such a decision would need the consent of Scotland's semiautonomous Parliament.
Ms. Sturgeon described the turmoil in the two main political parties in Westminster as "utter chaos, shambolic and frankly disgraceful."
"At a time when the whole United Kingdom needs leadership probably more than it's needed leadership in any part of the postwar period you have got the Conservative Party and the Labour Party completely abdicating responsibility," she said to Sky News on Sunday. "They are letting down people across England, across the entire U.K., and I look on in utter horror."


New York City Approves Rent Freeze
More than one million rent-regulated tenants in New York City received a rent freeze for the second year in a row on Monday.
The vote by the Rent Guidelines Board, a nine-member panel appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, was 7-0, with abstentions from the two members designated to represent the interests of building owners.
"We are turning the tide to keep this a city for everyone," Mr. de Blasio said after the vote, adding that the facts supported a rent freeze.
The board's chairwoman, Kathleen A. Roberts, said the vote reflected a drop in heating-fuel prices that led to lower operating costs over the past year for rental housing in New York.
Landlord groups criticized the rent freeze, calling it a political move by the mayor and his appointees at a time when local property-tax assessments and other costs have been rising for years. They said owners' heating costs haven't fallen as much as the board's data suggested.


Two Train Crew Members Found Dead After Texas Crash
Two railroad employees were found dead and a third is still missing following a fiery train collision in Panhandle, Texas.
BNSF Railway Co. said Wednesday that the remains of two crew members have been recovered. Of the two other employees involved in the crash, one is in stable condition at a local hospital and another is presumed dead by local officials.
"The entire BNSF family is terribly saddened by this event and we extend our deepest sympathy and thoughts to the families and friends of the employees involved in this incident," said BNSF Chief Executive Carl Ice in a statement.
BNSF said the crew members' families have been notified, but it isn't releasing the names.
Two trains operated by BNSF were traveling toward each other on the same track and collided around 8:25 a.m. on Tuesday approximately 27 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas, according to the railroad. The trains were carrying a combined 195 loads, and many of the containers were damaged.


Clinton Aide Says Email System Frustrated Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton and her top aides grew frustrated with the private email system she set up as secretary of state, concerned that at times it slowed communications and interfered with her diplomatic work, according to a deposition released Wednesday.
One of Mrs. Clinton's closest aides, Huma Abedin, gave the deposition this week as part of a lawsuit. In it, she talked about an incident in 2010 in which Mrs. Clinton apparently missed a call with a French government official because an email she had sent authorizing the call was slow in arriving.
In the deposition, released Wednesday by the plaintiff, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, Ms. Abedin described being "frustrated .. at the fact that I wasn't getting her messages."
Ms. Abedin, commenting on a publicly released email exchange she had with her boss in November 2010 about the missed call, said of Mrs. Clinton that "she seems frustrated, because she's not able to do her job."
As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton relied exclusively on a personal email account linked to a private server for official business. She has said she did so because she wanted the convenience of using a single device to handle all of her government and personal correspondence.

GOP CONVENTION
Cleveland Loosens Its Security Rules
The city of Cleveland has reached a compromise on security restrictions around the site of the Republican National Convention after a federal judge last week declared that the city's rules were unconstitutional.
The city and the American Civil Liberties Union reached a tentative settlement last week after a day of negotiations. The agreement was finalized over the weekend, and the city officially adopted new rules Wednesday.
According to the new rules, Cleveland will shrink the "event zone" around the Quicken Loans Arena, where most of the Republican National Convention will be held next month; extend the hours where permitted marches will be allowed; and change the designated parade route—which is for anyone who applies to use it—so that it comes closer to where delegates will be.
The ACLU—which had sued on behalf of three groups who said the city's restrictions on protests were "draconian"—hailed the new plan as a victory for free speech.
Thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Cleveland for the GOP convention, which will be held July 18 to 21.


Hail, Flooding in Las Vegas Force Rescues
LAS VEGAS--Intense thunderstorms pounded the Las Vegas area Thursday with golf ball-sized hail, gusty winds, destructive lightning and sheets of rain that swamped busy intersections and left at least one person hospitalized after she was plucked from a flooded wash, authorities said.
The woman was believed to have suffered a heart attack while she and two other people were rescued from rushing water near the Hard Rock Casino Hotel east of the Las Vegas Strip, Deputy Clark County Fire Chief Jeff Buchanan said.
Firefighters reached two other people and their dogs in another wash near Boulder Highway, about 5 miles east of the Strip, and rescued another two people at another site shortly after 6 p.m., Mr. Buchanan said.
At least 21 airline flights were diverted from busy McCarran International Airport , where the National Weather Service said wind gusts were clocked at 56 mph during the height of the storm.
Several vehicles stalled with water up to their headlights in one flooded intersection in nearby Henderson.


Adriano Espaillat Prevails in Democratic Primary
New York state Assemblyman Keith Wright conceded defeat Thursday in the race for the Democratic nomination to succeed U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, paving the way for state Sen. Adriano Espaillat to potentially become the first Dominican-American member of Congress.
The primary fight ended Thursday afternoon with a handshake outside Sylvia's Restaurant, a Harlem landmark at the heart of a neighborhood that has long been the center of black political power in New York City.
Outside the restaurant, where they had met privately alongside Mr. Rangel, Messrs. Espaillat and Wright clasped hands.
"I thank all of you for your support and let's move forward," Mr. Espaillat said.
If Mr. Espaillat prevails in the November general election—an outcome that appears likely, given the district's overwhelmingly Democratic constituency—the area won't be represented in the House by an African-American for the first time in more than 70 years.


Fleeing the Czars, Defying Gravity: A Fourth of July Immigrant Tale
On July 4, 1900, Samuel Hoffman and his father, Moshe, walked across the gangplank of a ferryboat that unceremoniously dumped them, along with a large group of fellow immigrants, at a dock on 14th Street in Manhattan. Independence Day for these newcomers meant liberation from czarist Russia.
New Yorkers were used to seeing confused, freshly arrived immigrants walking through lower Manhattan, but these two stood out. It was a searing-hot summer day and both father and son wore winter overcoats and boots.
"Our clothing and awkward bundles on our backs, as we walked along 14th Street, drew everyone's attention to us," Samuel Hoffman wrote at age 83 in an account for his family. "I was 15 years old, bewildered and almost overcome by the alien and unfamiliar scenes that stretched and throbbed all around father and me."
Like most immigrants, they couldn't speak the language. Coming from a small village in Russia, they had never seen anything even remotely like New York City. They could have arrived from another planet. All they had to guide them was a piece of paper with the address of a distant relative who lived on the Lower East Side.
After generations of extreme poverty and religious persecution, Moshe and his more savvy wife, Yetta, had decided to sell their house and borrow enough money to pay for two tickets to America. The plan was that father and son would then earn enough money in the New World to bring over the rest of the family. Constant hunger was a hallmark of Samuel's childhood in Russia. His daily diet had consisted of one piece of black bread and a potato dipped in herring sauce for flavor. Occasionally there were onions and radishes and a glass of milk for the children. It had been that way for generations and there was little chance it would ever change.


On the Unity of Terror
Islamic terrorism has had a banner few weeks, with 49 Americans gunned down in Orlando, 45 travelers killed in Istanbul, 20 diners butchered in Dhaka, and more than 200 Iraqis blown up in Baghdad.
Oh, and some Israeli settlers were killed, too. But they're not quite in the same category, right?
In November, after Islamic State's massacres in Paris, John Kerry offered some unscripted thoughts on how the atrocity differed from others. "There's something different about what happened from Charlie Hebdo, and I think everybody would feel that," he said, referring to the January 2015 attack on the satirical French newspaper. He continued:
"There was a sort of particularized focus [to the Hebdo attack] and perhaps even a legitimacy in terms of—not a legitimacy, but a rationale that you could attach yourself to somehow and say, okay, they're really angry because of this and that. This Friday [in Paris] was absolutely indiscriminate. It wasn't to aggrieve one particular sense of wrong. It was to terrorize people."
Mr. Kerry's remarks again betrayed the administration's cluelessness about ISIS, which aims to annihilate anything it doesn't consider . . . Islamic. Understanding its takfiri version of Islam, with its sweeping declarations of apostasy, is essential to understanding how it thinks and operates.


Police Body Cameras Prove Limited
When a black man was fatally shot by police in Baton Rouge, La., on Tuesday morning, the incident was captured in graphic detail by multiple cameras.
But none of that footage came from the two officers involved, since authorities said their lapel cameras became dislodged as they tried to subdue 37-year-old Alton Sterling outside the Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge.
The shooting, which was filmed by several bystanders, came after one of the officers appeared to kneel on Mr. Sterling and hold a gun to him. The incident shows the limitations of body cameras, even as cities scramble to outfit officers with the devices amid public outcry over police shootings.
The devices are meant to provide greater police transparency and accountability, but over the past several years, police across the country have encountered a litany of issues with body cameras—from officers refusing to activate them, to disputes over when footage should be publicly released, to technical malfunctions.
Meanwhile, citizens have taken to filming their own police encounters—sometimes live-streaming them in case phones are confiscated—compounding pressure on police to maintain official recordings.


Phoenix Police Use Pepper Spray, Tear Gas During Brutality Protest
A large protest in Phoenix Friday night against police brutality turned tense, when police tried to prevent protesters from blocking a major highway.
Police used pepper spray and tear gas on crowds, and protesters threw rocks at police, according to the public information officer for Arizona State Troopers.
A spokesperson for the Phoenix police department said the department had no immediate comment.
"Protesters throwing rocks at Phoenix PD," Damon Cecil, spokesman for the Arizona State Troopers, wrote on his Twitter feed. Soon after he wrote, "Tear gas deployed..avoid the area."
Fox 10 Phoenix reported that a crowd of about 500 people marched through the streets of downtown Phoenix as part of a demonstration against police violence that began at about 8 p.m. local time.


Dallas Shooter Faced Sexual- Harassment Claim in Army
DALLAS—Micah Johnson, the Army veteran who authorities say killed five Dallas police officers at a protest march on Thursday night, was a troubled soldier who was nearly expelled from the Army for sexual harassment, his military lawyer said.
Bradford Glendening, a military lawyer who also is in private practice in the Fort Hood area, said he represented Johnson beginning in 2014, after a female soldier accused him of sexually harassing her to the point where she sought a protective order and told superiors he needed mental-health treatment.
It is unclear if he ever received such treatment.
The Army didn't immediately respond to requests for comments about the case.
The Army has said Johnson was deployed to Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014 as a carpentry and masonry specialist in an Army Reserve unit and held the rank of Private First Class. According to Mr. Glendening, Johnson's troubles with the military began during that period.


Protests Turn Violent in St. Paul
Demonstrations turned violent in St. Paul, Minn., during protests over the killing of a black man by a Latino police officer in a routine traffic stop, resulting in more than 100 arrests and injuries to several officers who faced rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails.
Protesters closed a major interstate, where officials described a violent confrontation after a week of peaceful vigils and marches.
"Unfortunately last night some of the individuals that had gathered at the governor's residence decided to go from peaceful protest and exercising their First Amendment rights to rioting," St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said Sunday morning.
The city's top law-enforcement officer was even more blunt. "Protestors last night turned into criminals, and I'm really disgusted," said St. Paul's police chief, Todd Axtell.
Footage of the clash shows protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police and police responding with what appeared to be pepper spray and tear gas.


Minnesota Governor Says Race Played a Role in Police Shooting
St. PAUL, Minn.—Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said racism appears to have been a factor in the fatal shooting of a black man by a police officer Wednesday evening—the aftermath of which was captured on video and livestreamed by the man's girlfriend.
"Nobody should be shot and killed in Minnesota for a taillight being out of function," Mr. Dayton, said in a Thursday afternoon news conference.
"Would this have happened if those passengers and the driver were white? I don't think it would've."
The governor said all the facts weren't in, but added, "I'm forced to confront—and I think all Minnesotans are forced to confront—that this kind of racism exists."
Philando Castile, 32, and his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, along with her 4-year-old daughter, were pulled over Wednesday evening for what Ms. Reynolds said was a broken taillight in suburban Falcon Heights, a suburb of Minneapolis and St. Paul.


Pope's Teaching on Divorce Divides Bishops
ROME—Conservative and liberal prelates in the Catholic Church have put forth sharply different readings of Pope Francis' teaching on divorce—a situation complicated by the pontiff's own ambiguity.
In April, Pope Francis published "Amoris Laetitia" ("The Joy of Love"), which responded to a turbulent meeting of bishops on family issues by urging a more lenient approach to divorced Catholics, in effect encouraging priests to grant some of those who remarry Holy Communion.
Instead of settling the issue, the pope has opened the door to divergent interpretations as local bishops implement the document. Conservatives argue that nothing has changed while liberals see more flexibility—with broader implications for teachings on sexual morality.
On July 1, Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia published guidelines for his archdiocese, the sixth largest in the U.S., on how to carry out the teachings.
The archbishop, a leading conservative at last October's Vatican synod, reaffirmed the traditional rule that divorced Catholics who remarry without getting an annulment may not receive Communion—unless they abstain from sex with their new spouses, since the church considers such relations adulterous.


Obama: Both Activists and Police Should Foster Respectful Exchanges
President Barack Obama said activists and police departments both have their part to play in fostering respectful exchanges among Americans after five police officers were killed by a sniper in Dallas and two black men were shot by police last week.
Mr. Obama, speaking at a news conference in Madrid during a visit to Spain, called the killing of the officers last week "a reprehensible crime."
Harsh rhetoric against police officers, he added, is counterproductive for groups that are trying to trigger change.
"Whenever those of us who are concerned about fairness in the criminal justice system attack police officers, you are doing a disservice to the cause," Mr. Obama said in response to a reporter's question. "The vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people and do so fairly," he added. "If the rhetoric does not recognize that, then we're going to lose allies in the reform cause."
Similarly, Mr. Obama said, movements such as Black Lives Matter shouldn't be judged by one-off comments made by some members.


Protesters Unite Over Shared Tactic
In the week since the police slayings of two black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, thousands of protesters showed their outrage in demonstrations and rallies in cities across the U.S. Many protesters intentionally blocked interstate roadways, using a longstanding strategy of the civil-rights movement.
Benjamin Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said blocking highways is a tactic used by activists "who feel like they have no other way to get their community and the world to stop and take notice of what's happened."
It sends the broader public a message that "we will be inconvenienced if we allow our local government to continue to tolerate the killing of innocent civilians," said Mr. Jealous, a visiting professor at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
"There's a recognition of the use of placing one's body in peril," said Townsand Price-Spratlen, a professor at Ohio State University who studies grass-roots organizing. The practice echoes earlier protests, including the 1965 civil-rights march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., he said.
Governors in states like Louisiana and South Carolina have said they support the right to protest, but draw the line at blocking a road. "I'd ask that we not put our fellow citizens or law enforcement at risk, which is exactly what attempting to block highways does," said South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, in a statement.


The GMO Labeling Farce
Congress will soon head home for the summer, though not before zeroing in on a major national problem: what's in Doritos. The point is to rescue manufacturers from organic food groups that dress up rent-seeking in phony virtue.
Last week the Senate voted 63-30 to require labels on food produced with genetic engineering, which on all evidence is as safe as home-grown tomatoes. The Agriculture Secretary would develop a program that forces producers to add a symbol or notice about GMOs on packages, or a QR code, which consumers scan with smart phones. Small companies can opt for a website or a 1-800 number. The House is set to vote on the measure this week.
For months Congress has haggled over pre-empting Vermont's new GMO-labeling law, which mandates direct package labels for food sold or produced in the state. Some companies say they'll stop selling in the state rather than absorb the expense. But about 15 states are considering labeling schemes, and the Senate earlier this year failed to prevent a patchwork mess with a voluntary labeling program.
Thus comes the latest idea, from Senators Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) and Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich). The food industry supports the bill, in part because it allows companies flexibility on how to convey the information. It also precludes a state system that would pull over a Twinkies truck for inspection at the Connecticut border.
Organic interest groups—Just Label It, the Center for Food Safety—aren't satisfied. One complaint is the Agriculture Department's discretion to decide what the label will cover. The bill excludes meat from animals who chomped on genetically engineered feed, and more dispensations may follow. The irony is that the groups howling about arbitrary standards invented the false GMO distinction: Everything humans eat has been genetically modified through breeding.


Readers Sound Off on the Homeless,  Taxes and a Storied Hotel
Hotels Aren't Solution to Homeless Problem
It is sad and disappointing to see Human Resources Administration Commissioner Steve Banks now scrambling to head the Department of Homeless Services. Mr. Banks, who criticized use of hotels to house the homeless when he was at Legal Aid, now says hotel use is necessary ("Little Progress Made on Homeless," July 7).
Hotels are not only costly and unsafe, documented by recent homicides and domestic-violence issues, but they deprive families, especially children, of comprehensive social services and a stabilized environment where they can continue to attend school regularly. This has become a huge problem for the city's public schools system.

Set Up Bunkhouses
Homelessness is fundamentally a different way of life, one without privacy and/or property ownership. People lack options in the rental market, which is monopolized by the concept of physical privacy. Bunkhouses were historically used on cattle ranches, but why not in major cities? Experience working with the homeless in many situations has led me to conclude that safety is found in numbers. It is rather a matter of the peaceful outnumbering the non-peaceful when a large number of people are allowed to congregate for a night's rest. Sleeping is a vulnerable act, and people have a shared interest and keep one another in check.
Housing isn't affordable. Walls cost money and create the need for unshared amenities, and they drastically limit the number of individuals paying rent per square foot. We could take the mission model and make it a business by charging rent. The homeless can afford $200 to $300 a month. Provide equal day room to dorm space and operate without the prisonlike qualities such as kicking people out at 6 a.m., early-evening curfews and restricted access during the day.
Cities would make money, and the middle class would save tax money. Perhaps this living arrangement would even attract non-homeless individuals seeking lower rents. And the homeless no longer would have to bear people trying to "solve" their issues by fitting them back into the same way of life that triggered their homelessness in the first place.

U.S. Declassifies 28 Pages of Congress's Inquiry Into 9/11 Attacks
WASHINGTON—The U.S. government Friday released 28 pages of documents from a congressional inquiry detailing links the Federal Bureau of Investigation found between the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers and Saudi nationals based in the U.S.
The pages had been kept secret for more than a decade amid calls by many U.S. lawmakers for their release and a belief that they proved direct Saudi involvement in the airplane attacks on New York and Washington. The White House and Saudi government on Friday played down the significance of the information, arguing the declassified portion of the report should put to rest speculation that the Saudi government and the royal family played any direct role in the terrorist operation.
White House press secretary Joshua Earnest said the 28 pages "don't shed any new light or change any of the conclusions about responsibilities for the 9/11 attacks."
But families of those killed on 9/11 and some current and former lawmakers seized on the report to say additional investigations may be needed.
"Those of us who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and who were injured in those attacks welcome the release moments ago of the long classified 28 Pages of the Congressional Inquiry Report into 9/11," said a statement released by families of many 9/11 victims. "We will of course have further comment once we have had a chance to review the pages and consider their content in reference to other evidence of potential Saudi involvement in the attacks and rise of al Qaeda."


White House Holds Conference Call on Crisis
WASHINGTON—The White House hastily convened an administration conference call Saturday for discussions on the attempted coup in Turkey and its ramifications, which holds potentially widespread implications for U.S. military efforts against Islamic State and President Barack Obama's broader foreign policy.
Mr. Obama held the call from the Situation Room with national security and foreign policy officials and aides, the White House said in a statement. It comes hours after the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reasserted control following an attempted coup Friday by parts of Turkey's military.
The White House said in a statement that Mr. Obama "reiterated the United States' unwavering support for the democratically-elected, civilian Government of Turkey."
"The president instructed his team to continue to work with their Turkish counterparts to maintain the safety and well-being of diplomatic missions and personnel, U.S. servicemembers, and their dependents," the statement said. "While we have no indications as of yet that Americans were killed or injured in the violence, the president and his team lamented the loss of life and registered the vital need for all parties in Turkey to act within the rule of law and to avoid actions that would lead to further violence or instability."
Mr. Obama also stressed the need for "continued Turkish cooperation, including our joint efforts against terrorism."


Attempted Coup Sets Off Fight for Turkey
Rebellious Turkish military factions tried to seize control of the government late Friday in a stunning attempt to oust Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the longtime leader's forces said they were close to putting down the attempted coup.
The ensuing battle left at least 90 people dead across the country, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, with many of those in Ankara, the capital and the heart of the military.
Rebel troops fired on civilians on the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, killing three, as jets streaked over the city, according to the agency. Military leaders supporting the president ordered an F-16 jet fighter in the capital to shoot down a helicopter being used by the rebels. (More: Turkey's Erdogan Reasserts Control After Attempted Coup)
The government said the situation was largely under control by Saturday morning. Anadolu reported that 1,374 military personnel were detained across Turkey as part of an investigation into the coup attempt. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking on CNN Turk, said one rebel general was shot dead.
Mr. Erdogan flew back from a vacation resort to Atatürk International Airport in his stronghold of Istanbul, where thousands defied the rebel troops and swarmed their tanks to greet him.


Turkey Faces Its Iran 1979 Moment
Turkey is at a pivotal point in its history following the failed coup attempt of July 15. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, having survived the coup plot, won fresh legitimacy and gained a new ally: religious fervor in the streets. Mr. Erdogan can use this impetus either to become an executive-style president, or he can encourage the forces of religion to take over the country, crowning himself as an Islamic leader.
Though the incremental acquisition of power has been more his style in the past, the powerful eruption of Islamic support for him over the weekend may prove too tempting. This is Turkey's Iran 1979 moment—will a brewing Islamic revolution overwhelm the forces of secularism?
As the coup plot was unfolding on Friday night, Mr. Erdogan appealed to religious sentiments in the country, rallying his supporters to launch a counter-coup. On his orders, calls for prayer were issued from Turkey's over 80,000 mosques at 1:15 a.m.—not a time when people are supposed to be praying. The strategy worked, the call to prayer acted as a call to political action, and religious Turks took to the streets in defiance of the secularist military. Together with pro-government police forces, they overpowered the military's botched effort.
Since July 15, pro-Erdogan sentiments in Turkey have been running high. Calls to prayer continue throughout the day (Islam requires only five calls to prayer at set times daily), reminding religious Turks of their political duty to stand with the president.
Mr. Erdogan, a politician with an Islamist pedigree, came to power in 2003 as prime minister and head of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). At that time, he followed a policy of economic growth to build a support base. He also moved away from Islamist politics, instead embracing reform and seeking European Union membership.


Dissidents Silenced, GOP Convention Turns Attacks on Clinton
CLEVELAND—On the first night of Donald Trump's convention, Republicans assailed Hillary Clinton for the 2012 attack on Benghazi, illegal immigration and recent killings of police officers they said were the result of societal breakdowns caused by feckless leadership in Washington.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's campaign and its Republican National Committee allies presided over the most chaotic scene at a national party convention in generations, with hundreds of delegates shouting for a roll-call vote to disrupt his forthcoming nomination and one state delegation walking off the floor.
Mr. Trump's campaign dismissed the midafternoon disruption as the last gasp of a shrinking number of intraparty opponents. But Kendal Unruh, a leading anti-Trump delegate, said the schisms are now worse. "They chose to divide and try to conquer. He didn't unify the party," Mrs. Unruh said.
Near the close of the evening, Mr. Trump emerged from a darkened stage to introduce his wife, Melania, as the Queen anthem, "We Are the Champions," pumped through the arena's speakers. As he does, Mr. Trump predicted victory. "We're going to win so big, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to win so big," he said.
Upon taking the stage, Mrs. Trump said her husband was honored to be the GOP's choice for president and testified to his patriotic commitment.


The Dark Knight
Say this much for Donald Trump's Republican acceptance speech Thursday night: He stayed true to the campaign he has run from the start. The outsider stuck to his dark, populist themes of an America under siege by crime, terrorism, corruption and illegal immigration. He offered himself and his business success, more than any coherent set of ideas, as the revival medicine.
The speech was aimed at mobilizing an angry electorate to join him in storming the ramparts of Washington. It was a polarizing speech for a polarized era. President Obama has mobilized his two-term progressive majority by pitting secular against religious, minorities against police, young against old, middle class against the affluent, and even women against men. Mr. Trump is bidding to build a mirror-image majority by tapping the voters left out of Mr. Obama's favored coalition.
In that sense Mr. Trump's best moments were his call to speak for "the forgotten men and women," the "people who work hard but no longer have a voice." This is an echo of Richard Nixon's "silent majority" that played well in another angry era, the late 1960s.
He ignored or downplayed traditional Republican themes and constituencies to appeal to "laid-off factory workers"—a direct pitch to Bernie Sanders voters and union members. He spoke the blunt truth that too many African-American children are living in poverty and too many black young people aren't working, and he said the poor should have the same "choice" of schools as affluent Americans. These are constituencies that recent GOP nominees haven't spoken to, and they should.
Mr. Trump also offered a nod to gay Americans, albeit in the context of the terror attack on a gay club in Orlando. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire, made a brave and inspiring appearance by admitting to be a "proud" gay Republican. He was cheered for it. Democrats aren't likely to have a proud anti-abortion Christian on the stage in Philadelphia next week. And if they did, she would be booed.


Mayor's Office Provides Rivington Documents
Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration agreed to provide access to computers and documents it had previously denied the New York City Department of Investigation after the agency threatened legal action, officials said Tuesday.
The agency had previously requested the materials as part of its probe into the administration's decision to lift deed restrictions on a Lower East Side health-care facility, a move that led a private company to make what appears to be a $72 million profit.
The agency's investigation found "a complete lack of accountability" and significant communication failures among city officials, according to a report released July 14. Investigators noted that the city's Law Department had blocked access to crucial evidence, including thousands of pages of documents and City Hall computers.
"It is unclear what Rivington-related information remains on the City Hall servers and computers, to which DOI was denied access," investigators wrote.
A week ago, DOI Commissioner Mark Peters, who has recused himself from the investigation, authorized the agency to bring legal action if the Law Department didn't provide the requested records, officials said. The records the Law Department had redacted contained relevant information, city investigators said.


The Fight for $15 Will Hit North Philly Hard
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders may not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, but his influence can be seen in the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage that is part of his party's platform in Philadelphia.
The direct and immediate consequences of a higher wage floor on the entry-level job market are well known: fewer jobs for fewer people. Less discussed are the longer-term adverse outcomes for young people who can no longer find work at artificially high wages. If delegates to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this week need a striking example of why a 107% increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is a bad idea, they need only travel a few miles north of the city's convention center on Broad Street.
In the heart of North Philadelphia—represented by ZIP Codes 19121, 19122, 19132 and 19133—the unemployment rate for teenagers averages 42%, according to 2014 data (the most recent available) from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. The employment rate for teens residing in these ZIP Codes is an astonishingly low 14%—only one in seven has a job. (Nationwide, roughly one in three teens is employed.) Young adults in North Philadelphia ages 20 to 24 don't fare much better: Their jobless rate averages 28%.
The city's north side faces these crisis-level rates of youth joblessness with a starting wage—$7.25 an hour—that's consistent with the historical inflation-adjusted average minimum wage in the U.S. of $7.40. If anything, the current minimum wage is too high, given the large numbers of unemployed youths who can't find a job. The consequences of more than doubling it to $15 an hour would be disastrous.
By significantly reducing the available stock of job opportunities at the bottom end of the career ladder, a higher minimum wage increases the likelihood that unemployed teens will seek income elsewhere. A 2013 study by economists at Boston College analyzed increases in state and federal minimum-wage levels between 1997 and 2010. It found that low-skill workers affected by minimum-wage hikes were more likely to lose their jobs, become idle and commit crime. The authors warn that their results "point to the dangers both to the individual and to society from policies that restrict the already limited employment options of this group."


The Catholic Paths of Pence and Kaine
The dinner reception celebrating my ordination as a priest 27 years ago brought together friends and family, some of whom I had not seen for a long time. While I was speaking with my brother, an aunt came by and remarked to him, "You didn't go up for Communion at your brother's first Mass? What's that about?"
My brother, who hadn't practiced his faith for years, simply replied, "Because I didn't go to confession."
I told my brother, with admiration, "You're the last bad Catholic in America."
It made me proud that, despite not practicing his faith, my brother understood and respected Catholic doctrine and discipline. While reception of Holy Communion is a great joy, church teaching says that it is not a "right" that Catholics are entitled to. Rather, the faithful must be "properly disposed" to receive Communion. If someone's beliefs and choices don't accord with Catholic teachings, they should not receive the sacrament.
I've been thinking about that moment while surveying this year's political landscape. If only today's Catholic elected officials—many of whom advocate policies that directly conflict with the church's teaching—had my brother's understanding.

TUNIS, Tunisia—Tunisia's parliament passed a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Habib Essid on Saturday, effectively disbanding the government of the U.S.-trained agricultural economist.
The no-confidence motion was passed by 118 votes, easily crossing the 109-vote threshold, following a debate that stretched late into the night. Although the result was expected—Mr. Essid has faced criticism from across Tunisia's political spectrum—the vote was a mark of the instability that has bedeviled the North African country since it kicked off a wave of pro-democracy rebellions across the Arab world in 2011.
Mohamed Ennaceur, the president of Tunisia's parliament, told lawmakers that the country was "living through a difficult situation that demands sacrifices from all" and added that "we must now look to the future to return hope to all Tunisians."
Unlike other Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Libya—whose uprisings have degenerated into coups or civil conflicts—Tunisia has maintained its parliamentary democracy in the face of jihadist attacks, inflation and stubbornly high unemployment rates.
But the difficulties have steadily eroded the authority of Mr. Essid, whose position has also been undermined by political maneuvering within Tunisia's secular Nida Tounis party and pressure from the country's president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who called for a new national unity government last month.


Spread of Zika Virus in Puerto Rico Accelerates
The speed at which the Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico has accelerated sharply, according to new federal data, complicating already difficult efforts to prevent thousands of pregnant women in the territory from infection.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has predicted that one in four people on the island could be infected with Zika by the end of this year and has been working with the Puerto Rican government to try to slow its spread and protect pregnant women.
Now, new data from the agency show that Zika took off in the late spring and early summer as prime mosquito season got under way, and is on course to fulfill that disturbing prediction, said CDC Director Tom Frieden.
"It's what we feared," he said in an interview. "I think it's very important that everyone who cares about Puerto Rico understands what a severe problem it is today."
"We need to start to get ready to care for babies born with microcephaly," he said, referring to one of a constellation of devastating birth defects that Zika has been shown to cause. Women in Puerto Rico give birth to about 32,000 babies a year, the CDC says.


U.S. Charges 2 Venezuelan Officials With Cocaine Smuggling
U.S. prosecutors unsealed indictments Monday against two high-ranking Venezuelan officials for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S., in the latest setback for the embattled government of President Nicolás Maduro.
Prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn unsealed indictments against Gen. Néstor Reverol, the former head of the country's National Guard and its antidrug agency, and Gen. Edylberto Molina, who was second-in-command to Gen. Reverol at the antidrug agency.
The two men were in charge of the agency—known as the National Anti-Drug Office, an agency prosecutors compared to the Drug Enforcement Administration—between 2008 and 2010, the indictment said. It charged that the two co-conspirators helped facilitate shipments of cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela, up through Mexico and Central America and eventually to the U.S.
Gen. Molina now serves as Venezuela's military attaché in Germany. Gen. Reverol stepped down recently as head of the National Guard and hasn't yet been reassigned.
The developments came as electoral authorities in Venezuela on Monday said the opposition had completed the latest step in its drive to trigger a recall referendum to depose Mr. Maduro, whom opponents accuse of mismanaging an economy that is imploding.


Why This Recovery Is So Lousy
Donald Trump has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for saying that "the American dream is dead." But instead of slaying the messenger, critics on both sides of the aisle should be examining why so many Americans agree with Mr. Trump and why the Obama "recovery" has been so painful for so many.
When President Obama took office during the 2007-09 recession no president was ever better positioned to lead a strong recovery. With an impressive electoral mandate, Mr. Obama enjoyed a filibuster-proof Senate supermajority, a 79-vote House majority and a nation ready for change. History too seemed to smile on Mr. Obama's endeavor. The recession ended just six months into his first term and, with the sole exception of the Great Depression, every severe recession since 1870—when reliable annual data were first collected—had been followed by a vigorous recovery.
In his capacity to implement his program, Mr. Obama stood as a colossus with the fates on his side, the vast power of government at his disposal and no one—not Congress, the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve—willing or able to deny his will. No resources were spared. The Obama $836 billion stimulus exceeded all previous U.S. economic stimulus programs combined. The Treasury borrowed over $1 trillion a year for four years in a row, according to Office of Management and Budget data. The Federal Reserve injected $3 trillion of new reserves into the banking system, generating record-low interest rates.
Every government forecaster predicted happy days would soon be here again. In August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office projected 3.3% average real GDP growth for 2010-15. The Federal Reserve forecast growth as strong as 3.7%. Mr. Obama's own Office of Management and Budget expected peak growth of 4.5%. And these estimates were conservative as compared with the actual recovery patterns that had followed every major recession except the Depression.
In the six decades from 1948 to 2007, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.5%, including all the negative growth years during 10 recessions, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Affairs. Yet not once in the last seven years has annual economic growth ever reached 3%. Average real per capita income grew five times faster during the Clinton recovery, seven times faster during the Reagan recovery and 10 times faster during the Kennedy/Johnson recovery than during the Obama recovery.


Clinton Poll Lead Over Trump Widens to 9 Points
Republican Donald Trump showed signs that he is trying to get his campaign back on track amid a series of recent missteps, as a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a 9-point lead nationally over the New York businessman.
Mrs. Clinton's lead, at 47% to 38%, grew from 5 percentage points before the conventions in July. The finding comes as Mr. Trump and anxious Republicans are trying to shift focus away from GOP infighting and personality politics.
At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, a more restrained Mr. Trump read parts of his speech from notes and kept his attention trained on Mrs. Clinton.
"Hillary Clinton can never be trusted with national security," he said, which elicited cheers of "Lock her up!"
The Journal/NBC News poll of 800 registered voters was taken after both parties' national conventions and after Mr. Trump became mired in controversy for criticizing Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in the Iraq war. He stirred additional tensions within his party this week by refusing to endorse the re-election of House Speaker Paul Ryan in next week's primary, capping one of the rockiest stretches of Mr. Trump's campaign.


Japan Protests Chinese Vessels Near Disputed Islands
TOKYO—Japan summoned Chinese diplomats Saturday to protest, after six Chinese coast-guard vessels approached disputed East China Sea islands accompanying a fleet of hundreds of Chinese fishing boats.
Japan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it filed the protest after Japan's coast guard spotted the vessels Saturday along with a fleet of 230 Chinese fishing boats swarming around the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands. China also claims the islands, calling them the Diaoyu.
Japan is demanding the ships leave the area. Three of the Chinese coast-guard vessels were armed with what appeared to be gun batteries, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.
The Chinese fleet hasn't entered Japanese territorial waters so far, it said.
Asked about Japan's statement, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its position that the islands are "China's inherent territory" and that it has "indisputable sovereignty" over them and their adjacent waters.


Justice Department Finds Unconstitutional Practices Within Baltimore Police Department
The Justice Department found a pattern of unconstitutional practices within the Baltimore Police Department—a move that could lead to major changes in a police force that has been under fire since Freddie Gray died in 2015 from injuries sustained while in police custody.
Senior Justice Department officials are expected to announce the findings Wednesday, the next step in a process that is likely to lead to a consent decree spelling out specific changes Baltimore must make to improve its police force.
A police department spokesman declined to comment.
The Justice Department's investigation concluded the Baltimore Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of making unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests, according to its 164-page investigative report released Tuesday. The Baltimore police, the report said, also use enforcement strategies that result in "severe and unjustified" disparities in the rates of African-Americans being stopped, searched and arrested.
The report also alleged that the police department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force and of retaliating against people engaged in constitutionally protected expression.


Venezuelan Opposition Decries Recall Vote's Schedule
CARACAS, Venezuela—Venezuela's national electoral agency on Tuesday unveiled a schedule for a recall referendum against President Nicolás Maduro, a timetable the opposition decried, saying it would delay the vote long enough for the ruling party to stay in power regardless of the outcome.
Tibisay Lucena, head of the CNE agency, said Tuesday that if the opposition alliance submits the right paperwork on time, it could collect the four million signatures required to trigger the plebiscite on Mr. Maduro's rule in late October, the earliest possible date allowed by internal rules. If the drive is successful, the agency would have four months to call the referendum, putting the likely vote in early February.
The timing is crucial. If the referendum is held after Jan. 10 and Mr. Maduro is ousted, Vice President Aristóbulo Istúriz would serve out the term ending in 2019, ensuring the continuation of Maduro policies of price and currency controls. A referendum held before that date wouldn't only remove the president but it would also trigger new elections, which the polls show would result in a landslide opposition victory.
Tuesday's announcement is likely to deepen tensions in a highly polarized country and put off a solution to an unprecedented economic crisis that the opposition and analysts say risks turning into a humanitarian disaster.
The Democratic Unity Roundtable opposition alliance has accused the CNE, which is staffed with government supporters, of delaying the recall and vowed to take to the streets to force the vote this year.


City Makes Progress on Homeless Shelters
New York City officials said Friday they had reduced some building and safety violations in homeless shelters, providing welcome news in Mayor Bill de Blasio's struggle to curb homelessness and improve the shelter system.
City officials said shelter violations had dropped from about 25,000 in January to about 17,000 at the end of July, after a stepped-up program of inspections and repairs.
"This is the kind of progress that will make a difference for the clients we serve," said Steve Banks, who heads the city's effort to help the homeless.
The decline was seen primarily at free-standing shelters. At so-called cluster sites, where apartments are turned into shelters, the violations went up from this spring.
City Hall said it had increased inspections of shelters, conducting about 9,000 from the beginning of the year through July. In 2015, the city completed about 8,700 inspections, according to Mr. de Blasio's office.


Myanmar Leader to Discuss Contested Project on China Visit
Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, will have her diplomatic skills tested on a four-day trip to China this week that includes talks over the fate of a contentious Chinese-backed dam project.
China's government and Ms. Suu Kyi have cautiously courted each other since the one-time political prisoner emerged as the most likely winner in Myanmar's breakthrough elections last year. She was feted by Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing, a rare occurrence for an opposition leader.
Ms. Suu Kyi in turn is visiting China before a planned trip to the U.S. likely next month and has made a point of prioritizing Myanmar's relations with its giant neighbor. "Ties between neighbors are always more delicate than those between countries far apart," Ms. Suu Kyi told China's official news agency Xinhua last year.
China's Foreign Ministry said Ms. Suu Kyi was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday, but declined to give other details about her trip.
Among the topics of discussion, said a senior Burmese Foreign Ministry official, will be Myanmar's plans for a massive Chinese-invested hydropower plant in the north of the country.


Video of Dazed Aleppo Boy Reverberates Amid Horrors of Syria
BEIRUT—Syrian opposition activists released haunting footage showing a young boy rescued from a partially destroyed building in the aftermath of a devastating airstrike in Aleppo.
The image of the stunned and weary-looking boy, sitting in an orange chair inside an ambulance, covered in dust and with blood on his face, encapsulates the horrors inflicted on the war-ravaged northern city. Photographs of the boy were widely shared on social media.
An hour after his rescue, the building the boy was in completely collapsed.
The fighting has frustrated efforts by the United Nations to fulfill its humanitarian mandate, and the world body's special envoy to Syria on Thursday cut short a meeting of the ad hoc committee—headed by Russia and the U.S.—tasked with de-escalating the violence so that relief can reach beleaguered civilians.
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said there was "no sense" in holding the meeting in light of the obstacles to delivering aid. The U.N. is hoping to secure a 48-hour pause in the fighting in Aleppo.


Rio Sees Police Success as Exception
RIO DE JANEIRO—Rio police swiftly solved the case of the U.S. Olympic swimmers' robbery-turned-bathroom meltdown, transforming a major security embarrassment into a triumph.
But few real crime victims in Rio see their reports pursued with the efficiency authorities displayed in debunking gold medalist Ryan Lochte's claim that he and three teammates were stopped on the road and robbed at gunpoint this past Sunday.
Citing official data, academics say most crime investigations in Rio simply peter out. In the most recent study, in 2010, researchers at Rio's Candido Mendes University found that less than 3% of robberies in Rio, and less than 8% of murders, led to criminal sentences from 2003 to 2006.
Corruption, mismanagement and a sluggish legal system hinder criminal
justice in Brazil as in many developing countries, but experts say a particular problem with Rio's police is the uneven application of the law.


The Uber Class-Action Buffet
Federal judge Edward Chen on Thursday rejected a $100 million settlement in a class action alleging that Uber misclassified drivers as independent contractors. That's a big pot of cash, but the judge says the ride-hailing company can be raided for billions more.
The settlement negotiated by Boston-based plaintiffs attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who has formed a niche business shaking down Silicon Valley start-ups, would have reimbursed drivers between $12 and $1,950 for driving expenses, depending on their mileage. Deactivated drivers would also have received additional due process protections.
Judge Chen acknowledged that drivers faced a significant risk of losing at a trial decided by a jury, and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals might uphold the arbitration agreements with Uber that drivers had signed. That could have winnowed the class of 240,000 drivers to 8,000, which may be why Ms. Liss-Riordan agreed to settle the case and reduce her fees by $10 million.
Judge Chen complained, however, that the settlement required class members to drop all employment-related claims (e.g., minimum wage, rest and meal breaks and workers' compensation) to which full-time employees would be entitled under federal and state laws. Ms. Liss-Riordan didn't include those claims in her suit because they are harder to argue on a class basis, not that other attorneys won't try.
According to the judge, the settlement would have pre-empted at least 15 lawsuits for employment-related claims as well as cases "before various administrative bodies such as the NLRB." Other plaintiffs attorneys and unions vociferously objected to the settlement and even tried to get Ms. Liss-Riordan removed from the case.


The Climate Prosecutors Can't Dodge Congress Forever
For a sense of how far the left will go to enforce climate-change orthodoxy, read the recently released "Common Interest Agreement" signed this spring by 17 Democratic state attorneys general. The officials pledged to investigate and take legal action against those committing climate wrongthink. Beginning late last year, the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, all signatories to the agreement, issued broad-ranging subpoenas against Exxon Mobil and conservative think tanks. They sought documents and communications related to research and advocacy on climate change.
Concerned that these investigations were designed to chill First Amendment rights, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology issued its own subpoenas. In mid-July the committee, led by Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Texas), asked the attorneys general to produce their communications with environmental groups and the Obama administration about their investigations.
They have indignantly refused to comply. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman claimed, in a July 13 letter to Mr. Smith, that the committee was "courting constitutional conflict" by failing to show "a due respect for federalism." Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, in a similar letter dated July 26, asserted that the subpoenas are "unconstitutional" because they are "an affront to states' rights."
This view is utterly wrong. Federalism is a critical component of the constitutional architecture. The federal government exercises only limited and enumerated powers, and the states, under the Tenth Amendment, possess all other powers "not delegated to the United States." But when the federal government acts within its delegated powers, it is entitled to supremacy over the states.
The Supreme Court has long recognized Congress's power to investigate any matter within its legislative or oversight competence. With that comes a corresponding power to enforce its inquiries. The justices wrote in Barenblatt v. U.S. (1959) that the scope of Congress's power of inquiry "is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution."


FEMA Proposes Rules for Construction in Flood Areas
The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposed regulations Monday that would require companies and homeowners using federal funds on construction projects in flood-prone areas to build on higher ground—2 feet higher, in many cases.
The regulations stem from an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in January 2015. The order requires a new flood-protection standard for infrastructure projects that use federal money and is part of the administration's broader agenda to address climate change.
"This is ensuring that when federal investments are made we will rebuild higher and stronger," Roy Wright, deputy associate administrator for insurance and mitigation with FEMA, said from Baton Rouge, La., where he was helping oversee the agency's response to recent historic flooding that has killed 13 and displaced thousands.
Mr. Wright called the regulations the most significant flood-protection action a president has taken since Jimmy Carter.
Some business groups, however, are worried the regulations will drive up costs, and a number of Republicans criticized the move as another regulatory overreach by the Obama administration. The Republican-led House passed an appropriations bill in July containing language to defund the executive order.


Obama Promises Louisiana Flood Victims Support
President Barack Obama traveled to the Baton Rouge, La., area on Tuesday to pledge federal support to repair the damage from some of the worst flooding to hit the U.S. in years, while also calling for private donors and volunteers to help get families and local businesses back on their feet.
"What I want the people of Louisiana to know is that you're not alone in this," Mr. Obama said, noting that 100,000 people in the state had applied for federal aid. "Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt."
On Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced that it has provided more than $127 million so far to help people hit by the flooding—including $107 million to help pay for temporary rent, home repairs and other disaster-related needs. FEMA has paid out another $20 million to flood insurance policyholders who have filed a claim, according to a spokesman. FEMA is paying for about 700 families to be housed in hotels and motels.
Thirteen people died and tens of thousands of homes were damaged in the floods that arrived with pounding rains across southern Louisiana in the second week of August.
Many homes damaged in the flooding didn't have flood insurance, according to the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, a business organization. The rising waters invaded parts of the region that had not flooded in a long time, and where FEMA didn't consider flood insurance to be necessary. The group estimated that in the Baton Rouge area, 53,896 homes out of a total of 352,165 had flood insurance, only about 15% of the total, according to a report issued Tuesday.


Florida Court Order Adds Pressure on Clinton-Related Emails
WASHINGTON—A Florida court order issued Thursday increases the likelihood that material contained in recently discovered emails from Hillary Clinton's time at the State Department will be released before Election Day.
While most of the Clinton-email litigation has unfolded in multiple Washington, D.C., courtrooms, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch also has been pressing a Freedom of Information Act case in a south Florida federal court. That case seeks access to communications between then-Secretary of State Clinton and the White House during the time of the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation during its probe of Mrs. Clinton's private email use found 14,900 emails that hadn't been disclosed previously. The FBI earlier in August finished transmitting those documents to the State Department, which is currently sorting through them while attempting to navigate deadlines set by several judges.
The Florida court order, from U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas, said the State Department, if it discovers relevant materials from the Benghazi time frame, should produce records eligible for public release by Sept. 13.
In a similar case in Washington, the department had proposed to begin producing any Benghazi-related documents on Sept. 30. Judicial Watch has pointed to an Aug. 23 status report filed by the State Department in that case as suggesting the new emails might include Benghazi materials.


U.S. Aims to Ease Visa Rules to Help Immigrants Build Startups
The Obama administration has proposed making it easier for foreign-born entrepreneurs to build their startups in the U.S.
The proposal by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services gives the Department of Homeland Security discretion to grant temporary status to stay in the U.S. To qualify, entrepreneurs would have to have at least a 15% stake in a startup and an "active and central role" in operations.

Uzbek President Suffers Brain Hemorrhage
MOSCOW—Uzbekistan's longtime leader, President Islam Karimov, was hospitalized with a brain hemorrhage, raising questions about stability in a strategic Central Asian republic that borders Afghanistan.
The 78-year-old Mr. Karimov suffered the hemorrhage Saturday, wrote his younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva. He was considered stable but "it was too early to make any predictions about his future health," she said.
Under Mr. Karimov's leadership, Uzbekistan has gone down a path of increasing authoritarianism. The country of 30 million won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, but Mr. Karimov, who previously was the first secretary of the republic's communist party, has stamped out political dissent and free media.
His declining health could set off a contest for succession, with rival factions within the capital of Tashkent and the country's regions vying to install a leader who will promote their interests.
A managed succession likely would fall to an informal group of power brokers that would include senior officials in the capital as well as influential local leaders.


France's Presidential Choices
The campaign for next year's presidential election in France is under way, and voters will soon have to decide whether to nominate candidates who will defend the usual totems of French politics—or those who will break longstanding taboos.
On the right, the leading contenders are Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president who lost his job to Socialist incumbent François Hollande in 2012, and Alain Juppé, a onetime Prime Minister who was sacked by Jacques Chirac in 1996 for proposing pension reforms that led to widespread strikes.
Mr. Sarkozy, who won his single term in the Élysée on the strength of economic-reform promises that never materialized, is now campaigning as a culture warrior. This includes supporting local bans of modest swimwear worn by female Muslims and promising to extend clothing bans to include Muslim headscarves worn by women working in private businesses.
How sincere Mr. Sarkozy is about this is anyone's guess, but his political calculation is to entice voters tempted to cast ballots for Marine Le Pen's xenophobic, pro-Vladimir Putin National Front party. That might work, especially since a personal rift between Ms. Le Pen and her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, has led the latter to start his own party.
Mr. Juppé is taking the more courageous course of appealing to voters' intelligence. "In France, we keep saying that we have tried everything—except what has worked elsewhere," he said in May, and to that end he's proposing to eliminate the wealth tax and cut France's uncompetitive corporate-tax rate to 30% from 38%. That's a public service in the land of dirigisme, and it's a sign of French wisdom, or desperation, that he is rising in the polls.


Ferry Collides With Kayakers on Hudson River
A ferry that was leaving a Manhattan pier collided with a group of kayakers in the Hudson River on Tuesday evening, injuring five people including a man whose arm was severed, authorities said.
The incident occurred around 5:50 p.m. near Pier 79 at West 39th Street, in an area described by officials as a mixed-use waterway with no restrictions as to the type of watercraft allowed there.
A preliminary investigation determined that a NY Waterway ferry named the Jersey City was leaving the terminal and ran into the group of 10 kayakers, which included a guide, authorities said. The group of 10 people in eight kayaks was heading south from Pier 84 for a short paddle ride, authorities said.
"The water taxi hit two of the kayaks and multiple people went into the water and were recovered," said Inspector David Driscoll, commanding officer of the New York Police Department's Harbor Unit.
No one on the ferry was injured. It wasn't clear where the ferry was headed or how many people were on board.


State Department Says 30-Odd Hillary Clinton Emails Could Be Linked to Benghazi
WASHINGTON—The State Department said Tuesday it has found approximately 30 emails from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's account that could be related to the 2012 attacks on two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya.
The new documents were found among the roughly 15,000 emails forensically recovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Mrs. Clinton's personal email server as part of its investigation into whether she or her aides mishandled classified information.
Those emails were turned over to the State Department in the wake of the FBI probe, which resulted in no charges against Mrs. Clinton earlier this year. The messages are expected to be made public in the coming months.
The State Department couldn't say how many of the 30-odd emails previously have been made public, raising the possibility that some were among the 55,000 pages of emails already provided to the State Department by Mrs. Clinton's attorneys and released to the public. The department also couldn't say with any certainty that the identified messages were related to the Benghazi attacks.
"Using broad search terms, we have identified approximately 30 documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request. At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive, or whether they are duplicates of materials already provided to the Department by former Secretary Clinton in December 2014," said State Department spokesman John Kirby.


District Attorney Announces Intent to Charge Seven Bay Area Police Officers
OAKLAND, Calif.—Seven Bay Area police officers will be charged with crimes in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct involving an underage teenager, the Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley announced Friday.
Five former and current officers from the Oakland Police Department, as well as former officers from the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department and the Livermore Police Department will face charges that include a sexual act with a minor and exchanging compensation for sex, Ms. O'Malley said.
The charges weren't filed Friday but were expected to be filed soon, Ms. O'Malley said.
Six of the officers allegedly had sexual relations with the now 19-year-old woman, some when she was under 18, the age of consent in California, she said.
At Friday's press conference Ms. O'Malley also railed against another police department for arranging for the young woman to travel to Florida for rehabilitation.


Breakaway Democrats in N.Y. State Senate Get Boost
For four years a five-person faction of Democratic New York state senators that formed an alliance with the GOP has been accused by fellow Democrats of aiding the opposition as part of a power grab.
On Tuesday, the Independent Democratic Conference demonstrated its staying power in Democratic politics when a Senate candidate pledging to join the group won a hotly contested primary over rivals backed by mainline Democrats.
Union organizer Marisol Alcantara, who won the Democratic nomination in the 31st Senate District on Manhattan's West Side, is now poised to become the first Dominican woman to serve in the Senate and the first lawmaker to run her inaugural race as a candidate for the rebel conference.
If Ms. Alcantara wins the Nov. 8 general election, as is expected, the victory would give the conference more leverage as it considers which party to align with.
The conference, known as the I.D.C., has sparked criticism because its alliance with Republicans has allowed the GOP to maintain control over the Senate even though Democrats have a majority of members.


Arrest Made in Fire at Florida Mosque  Attended by Orlando Nightclub Shooter
FORT PIERCE, Fla.—A 32-year-old Florida man has been arrested and is facing a charge of arson with a hate-crime enhancement in connection with a fire that damaged the mosque that Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen occasionally attended, authorities said Wednesday.
Joseph Michael Schreiber was arrested without incident Wednesday afternoon and was being interrogated by investigators probing a fire that was set late Sunday at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, said Maj. David Thompson of the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office.
Maj. Thompson told a news conference that Mr. Schreiber was taken into custody on a street in Fort Pierce by authorities acting on tips from members of the community and aided by surveillance video taken from the mosque and elsewhere.
The arson charge, coupled with the hate-crime enhancement, could bring a sentence of as much as 30 years in prison in event of a conviction, Maj. Thompson said.
The fire was set on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. The blaze also coincided with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.


Les Déplorables
Hillary Clinton's comment that half of Donald Trump's supporters are "racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic"—a heck of a lot of phobia for anyone to lug around all day—puts back in play what will be seen as one of the 2016 campaign's defining forces: the revolt of the politically incorrect.
They may not live at the level of Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables," but it was only a matter of time before les déplorables—our own writhing mass of unheard Americans—rebelled against the intellectual elites' ancien régime of political correctness.
It remains to be seen what effect Hillary's five phobias will have on the race, which tightened even before these remarks and Pneumonia-gate. The two events produced one of Mrs. Clinton's worst weeks in opposite ways.
As with the irrepressible email server, Mrs. Clinton's handling of her infirmity—"I feel great," the pneumonia-infected candidate said while hugging a little girl—deepened the hole of distrust she lives in. At the same time, her dismissal, at Barbra Streisand's LGBT fundraiser, of uncounted millions of Americans as deplorables had the ring of genuine belief.
Perhaps sensing that public knowledge of what she really thinks could be a political liability, Mrs. Clinton went on to describe "people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them . . . and they're just desperate for change."


House Committee Urges President Not to Pardon Snowden
WASHINGTON—Every member of the House Intelligence Committee signed a letter to President Barack Obama on Thursday urging him not to pardon Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who prompted an overhaul of government surveillance programs after he leaked stolen records about the agency in 2013.
The letter, signed by 23 members of Congress, comes as a new movie about Mr. Snowden is released. Civil liberties groups are pushing for the president to pardon Mr. Snowden in his final months in office, although the White House has shown no sign of agreeing to this request.
The letter from the committee members said Mr. Snowden "perpetrated the largest and most damaging public disclosure of classified information in our nation's history."
Mr. Snowden is believed to be living in Russia. When he first released batches of the stolen documents, he was in Hong Kong. He fled to Russia and was planning to fly to Latin America, but U.S. officials revoked his passport.
His disclosures shed light on a number of secret surveillance programs, including the government's practice of sweeping up telephone records of millions of Americans. Supporters of the program said it was necessary for national security, but critics said it amounted to a vast overreach of U.S. power. The program has been scaled back by Congress following the outcry from Mr. Snowden's disclosures.


California Firefighters Push for More Pay
LOS ANGELES—In late August, Emily Travis, a seasonal firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, was working to control a wildfire in Northern California when flames suddenly jumped containment lines. Ms. Travis bolted wearing 50 pounds of gear and heavy boots, the fire so close she could feel its heat on her back.
She and her crew made it to an already burnt section of brush—a safe spot called the "good black"—then returned to the front line. For her work, Ms. Travis makes $10 per hour, the state's minimum wage.
"The fact that it's so taxing and that we could go somewhere else to make the same amount .. sometimes, you don't know if it's worth it," said Ms. Travis, 21, who said she loves fighting fires but hopes wages increase so she can enter the field permanently. She works on a small livestock ranch the rest of the year, earning $15 an hour.
As more than 2,000 firefighters combat six large wildfires burning across this drought-ridden state, many of them are engaged in another battle: over pay.
On large, complex fires, state crews often work alongside counterparts from federal, county and city agencies. But state firefighters earn about a third less per hour than those who work for counties and cities, according to a recent state government study.


Rikers Officials Convicted in Assault of Inmate Sentenced to State Prison
Two former high-ranking Rikers Island supervisors were sentenced to prison Friday for ordering the beating of an inmate whose eye sockets and nose were broken when correction officers stomped on his face at the New York City jail complex.
Former Assistant Chief of Security Eliseo Perez Jr. directed subordinates to beat Jahmal Lightfoot after the inmate locked eyes with him, prosecutors said. They said former Capt. Gerald Vaughn told officers to "f— him up."
"This is a case about dereliction of duty," state Supreme Court Justice Steven Barrett said in a Bronx courtroom overflowing with correction officers and supporters.
The judge sentenced Mr. Perez to 61⁄2 years and Mr. Vaughn to 51⁄2 years. Four former officers—Alfred Rivera, Tobias Parker, Jose Parra and David Rodriguez—each received 41⁄2 years for carrying out the attack.
Sentencing the men presented unusual challenges, Justice Barrett said, partly because some were following orders from those in authority.


Missing From 2016 Race:
Donald Trump is unfurling new policies that would spread tens of billions of federal dollars across the landscape of American life—borders, schools, highways and bridges, even child-care arrangements.
He wants to raise spending for the Pentagon and triple the number of immigration and customs officials; double the amount Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton proposes for infrastructure; allocate $20 billion to expand school choice and $2.5 billion for guaranteed paid maternity leave. And more.
He is proposing more than $4 trillion in tax cuts and vowing not to cut fast-growing entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
Mr. Trump said in an economic speech last week that he expects his policies wouldn't add to the federal deficit. But while his spending plans are specific, his proposals to pay for them have been less precise: He counts on economic growth to generate more revenue, and on oft-tried measures as eliminating waste and catching more tax cheats.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton is proposing a far bigger expansion of government spending than Mr. Trump, with tax increases to pay for it. She wants to spend more to lower or fully eliminate college costs for many young Americans, for example, and has proposed a big boost in spending for early childhood education.


Shakespeare on Our 'Scurvy Politicians'
This year marks the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. So, in honor of the bard, and with a selfish desire to flee the circus of the 2016 election, I've been revisiting his plays, mainly on DVD and streaming video from the comfort of my well-worn couch.
What I've experienced is not so much an escape from the tragedy and comedy of Trump vs. Clinton, but greater insight into the character of our political royalty. From Lady Macbeth's lust for power to King Lear's blindness to basic humanity, Shakespeare, speaking from the grave, tells us more about the players on our political stage than any Matt Lauer interview ever could.
This became clear to me last month at a top-notch performance of "King Lear" by the American Players Theatre in the Wisconsin woods. For those unfamiliar with the play, it is about a king who, getting on in years, decides to split his kingdom among his three daughters. But first they must publicly profess their love for him in a competition for the old man's affection and their share of the kingdom. One doesn't have to be a Shakespearean scholar to realize that this will not end well.
By Act III, Lear is stripped of all status and power. Mad and wandering, he comes upon his old crony, the Earl of Gloucester, whose eyes have been plucked out by Lear's power-hungry son-in-law, Cornwall. "Get thee glass eyes," says Lear, "and, like a scurvy politician, seem to see the things thou dost not." When the line was delivered, the audience let out a gasp.
Inspired, I set out to compile a Top 10 list of Shakespeare's best lines spoken by or about princes, kings, queens, emperors and those who would dethrone them. I'll leave it to you to match today's politicians with the quotes that best suit them:


It's Still Clinton's Race to Lose
Despite a distressingly low signal-to-noise ratio in this year's presidential contest, Americans have taken the measure of both candidates. Now, thanks to a fine-grain poll by Quinnipiac University, we can see what they think.
Only 32% of likely voters believe that Mrs. Clinton is honest, compared with a larger but still dismal 40% for Mr. Trump. Fifty percent think he is "honest enough" to be president, while only 43% think she is. Just 37% say she is more transparent than Mr. Trump; 54% say the opposite.
Asked to explain why they do not regard Mrs. Clinton as honest enough to be president, roughly equal shares of the naysayers cite her private email server, the Benghazi attack, and their impression of her as evasive and calculating. (Only 39% believe that she bases her policies on a set of core values.) And 34% of the electorate, including 38% of independents, say that her use of a private email server changed their opinion of her honesty.
Clearly Mrs. Clinton's burning desire to preserve what she once called a "zone of privacy" has cost her dearly, and not just because it has made her appear less than honest and transparent. Asked whether she believes that she has to play by the same rules as everyone else, only 42% of the electorate responds affirmatively; 56% think she does not believe that the rules apply to her. It is unlikely that she will be able to reverse these impressions by Election Day.
If the news is bad for Mrs. Clinton, it is much worse for Mr. Trump. Seventy-five percent of likely voters think he should publicly release his tax returns, and 59% do not believe that his stated reason for not doing so—the continuing IRS tax audit—is the real reason. A healthy majority, 61%, believe that "the way Donald Trump talks appeals to bigotry." This judgment extends well beyond minority voters to include 61% of whites with college degrees and 56% of whites overall.


An Obama Veto Worth Backing
Legislation rushed through Congress with unanimous support often spells trouble, and so it is with the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (Jasta) that President Obama is expected to veto this week.
The bill, which passed both houses of Congress on a voice vote, would create a new exception to sovereign immunity, the doctrine that protects foreign countries and their diplomats from lawsuits in U.S. courts. The bill is designed to let families of victims sue Saudi Arabia and its citizens for alleged complicity in 9/11.
The plaintiffs bar is salivating as it eyes Saudi-owned U.S. assets, and the Saudis would be foolish to keep assets in the U.S. where they could be confiscated. Their emergency sale would have hard-to-predict impact on asset prices, harm the reputation of the U.S. as a destination for foreign capital, and perhaps cause the Saudis to drop their currency peg to the dollar.
As dangerous would be the impact on American assets abroad as other countries play copycat and carve their own exceptions to sovereign immunity. The U.S. has far more assets overseas to seize, and foreign courts offer far less legal protection against frivolous lawsuits than American courts do.
Supporters say Jasta targets only the Saudis, but other countries will notice that the U.S. has abandoned sovereign immunity when it suits. In July the Dutch parliament said it considers Jasta a "gross and unwarranted breach of Dutch sovereignty," so don't be surprised if other countries retaliate.


Federal Charges Filed Against N.Y. Terror Suspect
The Justice Department filed charges Tuesday against Ahmad Khan Rahami for a series of bombs left in and around New York during the weekend, as officials said the suspect's blood-soaked journal indicated he was angry over what he perceived as the U.S.' war on Muslims.
Some charges are contained in a federal complaint filed in federal court in New York. Another, separate complaint is expected to be filed in federal court in New Jersey.
Mr. Rahami allegedly planted bombs in two locations in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, and allegedly placed explosives in Seaside Park and Elizabeth, N.J.
One of the Manhattan bombs injured 29 people when it exploded on Saturday night. The other Manhattan bomb failed to detonate. The bombs in New Jersey, which were clusters of pipe bombs, partially detonated but didn't harm anyone.
The charges came as the White House said for the first time that based on indications so far, the bombings were an "act of terrorism."


Three Phoenix Police Officers Resign  After Marijuana Allegations
PHOENIX—Three Phoenix police officers have resigned after a man alleged they forced him to eat marijuana found in his vehicle to avoid going to jail, Chief Joseph Yahner said Thursday.
A fourth officer, Jeff Farrior, was demoted from lieutenant to sergeant for being aware of the incident and not taking appropriate action, Chief Yahner told reporters.
"Their actions are appalling and unacceptable. This conduct is against everything that we stand for," the police chief said.
Police identified the three officers who quit as Richard G. Pina, Jason E. McFadden and Michael J. Carnicle.
Two of them are being investigated both criminally and by the department, Chief Yahner said, adding that the third officer is considered a witness to the act and is the subject of just the administrative investigation.


Syrian Troops Advance Near Aleppo as Aerial Bombardment Continues
BEIRUT—Syrian troops captured a rebel-held area on the edge of Aleppo on Saturday, tightening their siege on opposition-held neighborhoods in the northern city after what residents described as the heaviest air bombardment of the 5 1⁄2-year civil war.
The new government push came as the United Nations said nearly two million people in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and onetime commercial center, are without running water, following the escalation in fighting over the past few days.
The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting on the escalating attacks Sunday morning at the request of the U.S., Britain and France.
Government forces captured the rebel-held Palestinian refugee camp of Handarat as airstrikes pounded rebel-held eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo, killing at least 32 people, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Local Coordination Committees, another monitoring group, said 49 were killed on Saturday alone.
The Observatory said the death toll in Aleppo is expected to rise since many people are in critical condition and rescue workers are still digging through the rubble.


Colorado Effort Stirred Property-Rights Concerns
Colorado's struggles to manage development in wildfire zones shows how difficult it can be to balance the need to limit taxpayer risk with the desire to preserve residents' freedom to live where they choose.
Gov. John Hickenlooper convened a task force in 2013 to examine ways to reduce the risks of development in wildfire zones, following the two most destructive fires in the state's history. The group suggested developing a wildfire risk-mapping system that could be disclosed to property owners, potential buyers and the insurance industry. Home builders pushed back on disclosure requirements.
In the end, the modeling system hasn't been rolled out statewide and development decisions were left to local government agencies. Land-use experts say that has created a patchwork of regulations across the state.
In Boulder County, local officials since the 1970s have taken a hardline approach to development in rural areas, requiring a minimum lot size of 35 acres to discourage building.
In El Paso County, on the other hand, local officials were hesitant to mandate strict new building codes after a deadly 2013 blaze, fearing the added costs would discourage homeowners from returning.


Shooting by Off-Duty Officer Called 'Brutal' and 'Deliberate'
An off-duty New York City police officer accused of fatally shooting a man in a road-rage incident committed a "brutal" and "deliberate" act, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
Wayne Isaacs, 37 years old, faces charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter in the killing of Delrawn Small, also 37, after a traffic dispute at a stop light on Atlantic Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn in July.
Officer Isaacs was arraigned Tuesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court, where a judge set his bail at $500,000 bond or $350,000 cash and ordered him to wear an ankle bracelet and surrender his passport.
"This defendant fired not one, not two, but three shots from a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun as the victim approached with no weapon," prosecutor Joshua E. Gradinger said in court. "The defendant had no legal justification."
Stephen Worth, an attorney for Officer Isaacs, said his client was not guilty because he was attacked before drawing his weapon. He called the bond amount "outrageous."


Hungary's Refugee Rebellion
Hungarian voters head to the polls Sunday for a referendum on the European Union's response to the migrant crisis, and polls show voters will reject the EU's refugee-relocation plan by a wide margin.
At issue is whether the EU can impose refugee quotas on states that are reluctant to accept them. Under a system devised in Brussels last year, some 160,000 migrants were to be relocated among EU countries.
Hungary was expected to accept about 1,000, though the scheme would also see an estimated 54,000 now residing in Hungary relocated elsewhere. That system has failed, with only a few thousand actually relocated. More recent proposals would relocate migrants to EU countries directly from the Middle East. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán objects in principle to the EU imposing quotas without the consent of elected national governments.
Mr. Orbán speaks for many in Central and Eastern Europe who argue that their relatively homogeneous societies have little experience integrating new arrivals. He also points to recent terrorist attacks by migrants in France and Germany, and to the West's failure to integrate its Muslim minorities.
Mr. Orbán has an authoritarian streak, and he has mused about building an "illiberal state" on the Vladimir Putin model. EU leaders fret about "Orbánization" in neighboring countries such as Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.


Bystanders to Genocide
Russian and Syrian government forces continue to press their offensive in Aleppo, killing hundreds of civilians with incendiary and bunker-busting bombs. Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has denounced the assault as "barbarism" and called out Russia at the Security Council for its chronic mendacity and refusal to take responsibility for its participation in the slaughter.
Ms. Power knows something about barbarism and responsibility. In 2001 she published a searing account in the Atlantic about the Clinton Administration's failure to stop the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which as many as 800,000 Tutsis were killed over three months by their Hutu neighbors.
Ms. Power spared no one in her depiction of the Administration's "almost willful delusion" about the killing, its diplomatic prevarications to avoid using the word "genocide," and its concern with how U.S. intervention would play in the midterm elections. She was particularly tough on U.S. officials who "were firmly convinced that they were doing all they could—and, most important, all they should—in light of competing American interests and a highly circumscribed understanding of what was 'possible' for the United States to do."
The essay was titled "Bystanders to Genocide." Ms. Power later expanded the article into a book, "A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide," for which she was widely praised. Barack Obama read the book and promoted her rise in government.
Fast forward to the present, and Ms. Power can sound like those officials she once scolded for thinking they were doing everything they could given the complexities of the situation.


Pope Francis Concludes Visit to Georgia, Azerbaijan
TBILISI, Georgia—Pope Francis concluded a three-day visit to the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan on Sunday, a journey that proved to be a diplomatic balancing act.
The south Caucasus presents an important test of the pope's vision of ecumenism: the idea of a universal Christian church. The region is home to centuries-old Christian communities, but Catholic worshipers are a minority. It is also a complex mix of religious and ethnic animosities.
The pontiff's journey began on Friday in Georgia, where he was met at the airport by Patriarch Ilia II, the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church. While in Georgia, Pope Francis reached out to the Georgian church, despite an apparent snub by Orthodox leaders who declined to attend a Mass he held Saturday in a largely empty stadium in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after they also discouraged followers from attending.
"We should work together. We should respect each other and pray together," he said, following the Mass in comments to the Catholic faithful. "This is ecumenism."
The apparent courtship extended to comments on marriage in which he embraced ideas held dear by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Without addressing homosexuality directly, he criticized "ideological colonization"—shorthand for the influence of foreign ideas on traditional values—for contributing to an assault on the institution of marriage.


Crime and Murders Are Down in New York for 2016
The New York Police Department released crime statistics Monday that showed last month was the safest September on record. City officials said the data further debunk claims of rising crime made at the first presidential debate.
At the monthly crime briefing, Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill reported a 3% decline in overall crime so far in 2016, with 10 fewer murders through September than in the same period last year.
The data come a week after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in the first debate that murders were up in the city, and that the use of stop-and-frisk had a significant impact on previous declines in crime.
"I want to always try and dispel the misinformation we heard last Monday," said Mr. de Blasio.
"The amount of stop-and-frisk activity since its height in 2001 is down 97%," he added. "So, affirming once again the clear reduction in the use of stop-and-frisk accompanied by the consistent reduction in crime."


It's Time for the Feds to Get Out of Indian Country
As Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump court the minority vote, they have paid virtually no attention to one of the most impoverished groups—Native Americans. More than any other group, American Indians are shackled by bureaucratic red tape that deprives them of the same rights and dignity as other Americans.
The continuing debate over the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which would pass near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, highlights the desire of Native Americans to have their voices heard. In that case, the tribe claims they were not sufficiently consulted on the location of the pipeline project that might affect their land and water.
But the question of Indian rights goes far beyond the location of a single pipeline: Shouldn't Native Americans be free to make their own decisions about the use of natural resources in Indian Country?
When Columbus stumbled into America, indigenous people already had a rich cultural and economic history. Lessons in farming from Eastern tribes are now the stuff of Thanksgiving legend. Vast indigenous trading networks stretched all across the continent. West Coast fishing tribes were so rich that they could afford to destroy some of their wealth, such as canoes, baskets and even food, in "potlatch" ceremonies.
Moreover, Native Americans showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new goods and technology. Italian trade beads became an integral part of American Indian decoration and art. The Spanish horse transformed Plains Indian hunting and warfare.


U.N. Security Council Fails to Agree on New Aleppo Cease-Fire
United Nations—Two competing United Nations Security Council resolutions for a cease-fire in and around the embattled city of Aleppo were vetoed by competing world powers on Saturday, further dimming prospects for peace in Syria.
The showdown brought the latest attempts at forging a diplomatic path to ending the Syrian conflict to another dead end, following the collapse of a short-lived U.S.-Russian cease-fire cooperation last week and culminating in vetoed resolutions on Saturday. It remains to be seen whether diplomatic steps can make any progress in finding a formula for peace.
With Russia and Syria continuing to bombard Aleppo from the air, with combatant and civilian casualties mounting, the U.S. has said it is considering sending arms to moderate rebel groups in the city.
On Saturday, Russia vetoed a resolution from France that was co-sponsored by Spain and backed by more than 50 other countries calling for an immediate halt to the fighting in Aleppo and for the grounding of military flights. It was Russia's fifth veto of resolutions over Syria since the conflict began nearly six years ago.
Meanwhile, the U.S., France and U.K. vetoed a Russian resolution seeking separation of what it considers intermingling extremist groups and moderate rebel fighters as a precondition to any cease-fire. That resolution didn't mention any halt to the devastating bombardments of Aleppo by Russian and Syrian aircraft.


Some Republicans Withdraw Trump Support as Party's Leaders Condemn Comments
WASHINGTON—Prominent Republicans were united Friday night in their condemnation of Donald Trump's vulgar comments about women in 2005, with a handful withdrawing their endorsements of the candidate or calling for him to step aside as the GOP nominee.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he was "sickened by what I heard" and disclosed that Mr. Trump had been uninvited from a joint appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. The Trump campaign said vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, would go instead.
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has worked to build bridges between the party and the Trump campaign, said "No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever."
Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.), who is in a tight re-election battle and had already withdrawn his endorsement of Mr. Trump in June after the candidate mocked a man with a disability, said Mr. Trump should quit the presidential contest. On Twitter, he wrote: "@realDonaldTrump should drop out. @GOP should engage rules for emergency replacement."
Sen. Mike Lee of Utah issued a statement after midnight EDT saying Mr. Trump should step aside as nominee. "It's time for us not to settle; it's time for us to expect more," said Mr. Lee, calling on Mr. Trump to "allow someone else to carry to banner" of GOP principles.


HP's Whitman Shakes Up New Jersey House Race
Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and a longtime Republican fundraiser, is throwing her support behind the Democratic candidate in New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District race.
Ms. Whitman, who ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 2010, estimates that 90% of her political contributions have been to Republican candidates.
She chaired New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's finance team during his bid for the Republican presidential nomination but criticized his decision to endorse the eventual nominee, Donald Trump. Ms. Whitman endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in August.
In a telephone interview last week, Ms. Whitman said she is backing Democrat Josh Gottheimer in the Nov. 8 election because she believes his opponent, incumbent Scott Garrett, is a "Republican extremist."
"We need reasonable people from all sides to reassert leadership and work together on the country's biggest challenges," Ms. Whitman said. "I have no doubt that Josh will play a role in unlocking the gridlock in Washington."


Donald Trump's New Attack Strategy Aims to Curb Clinton Vote
Donald Trump, faced with opposition inside and outside his party, plans to renew the nationalist themes that built his base and amplify his no-holds-barred attacks against Hillary Clinton to try to depress Democratic voter turnout, his advisers said.
Following the release of a tape-recording of his lewd comments about women and several high-profile Republican defections over the weekend, Mr. Trump has effectively given up the conventional wisdom of trying to reach voters far outside his core of support, one high-level Republican supporter said.
The new strategy emerged Tuesday on Mr. Trump's Twitter account when he sent out messages attacking Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as a weak leader after Mr. Ryan announced he wouldn't appear with the nominee.
"It's so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to," Mr. Trump wrote.
Later, in an interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that if he wins the election Mr. Ryan should be removed, saying Mr. Ryan "maybe wouldn't be there, maybe he'll be in a different position."


Former 'Apprentice' Contestant Accuses Donald Trump of Unwanted Sexual Advance
A former contestant on Donald Trump's "The Apprentice" said Friday that the Republican presidential nominee forced himself on her at a meeting at a hotel in 2007, kissing her aggressively, touching her breast and thrusting his genitals toward her.
Summer Zervos, who appeared on Season 5 of the reality show, became the latest woman to come forward with allegations of unwanted sexual advances from Mr. Trump since last week's release of a video showing Mr. Trump in 2005 speaking lewdly about being able to force himself on women because of his fame.
Mr. Trump said in a statement Friday, "I vaguely remember Ms. Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years. To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life. In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California."
The week has brought an onslaught of accusations against Mr. Trump over alleged sexual misconduct that's occurred since the 1980s.
Mr. Trump has gone forcefully on a counterattack, denying the accusations and threatening to sue the New York Times for an article in which two women shared their experiences of Mr. Trump's alleged advances.


Naive Nuclear Proposals for a Dangerous World
The White House announced in June that it is considering new initiatives to advance President Obama's goal of nuclear disarmament. The U.S. has already reduced its deployed nuclear arsenal by about 80% since the Cold War ended. The announcement inspired a flurry of proposals for further reductions and limitations, including calls for a no-first-use nuclear policy—which some in Congress endorsed this week—and the elimination of America's intercontinental ballistic-missile force.
These two proposals are being promoted by antinuclear activists and some former senior officials, including former Defense Secretary William Perry. Yet their adoption would encourage opponents' provocations, degrade our ability to deter large-scale wars, undermine the security of already-frightened U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, and contribute to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. That's why every Republican and Democratic president for 70 years has opposed declaring to the world that the U.S. will never use nuclear weapons except in response to an opponent's first use.
Advocates of no-first-use charge that if the U.S. rejects that policy, it must then embrace a nuclear first-use policy, about which they then rail. But this charge falsely posits only two possible policy options—no-first-use or first-use. There's a third option: Continue the current policy of purposeful ambiguity regarding the U.S. use of nuclear weapons.
U.S. nuclear ambiguity compels enemies to consider the possibility that even their massive use of conventional force, or chemical and biological weapons, could lead to a U.S. nuclear response. By raising the potential cost of aggression against the U.S. and its allies, our policy of nuclear ambiguity has helped prevent highly lethal attacks. After the Gulf War, Iraqi Gen. Wafic Al Sammarai, the former head of Iraqi Military Intelligence, said that Saddam Hussein did not use chemical or biological weapons because: "The warning was quite severe and quite effective, the allied troops were certain to use nuclear arms and the price will be too dear and too high."
Before the establishment of nuclear deterrence, the great powers of Europe often went to war against one another many times a century. Even the catastrophic losses of World War I could not deter World War II. For the seven decades since 1945 nuclear deterrence has helped prevent the repeat of this ugly cycle.


U.N. Official Pushing for War-Crimes Inquiry of Aleppo Bombardment
UNITED NATIONS––Pressure on Syria and its main ally, Russia, intensified at the United Nations on Friday when the organization's top human-rights official said the bombardment of Aleppo amounted to war crimes.
The U.N.'s 47-member Human Rights Council voted in Geneva to start an independent special inquiry into human-rights violations in Aleppo and to refer the perpetrators to the International Criminal Court.
The resolution, introduced by the U.K. with the backing of U.S., European and Arab allies, was adopted 24-7, with Russia and China voting against and 16 countries abstaining. An existing U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria will lead the investigation and issue its findings in March.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a video message to the council that Aleppo had turned into a "slaughterhouse." He didn't directly blame Russia, and noted that both the armed opposition and the government were responsible for the continuing violence. But he said the majority of civilian casualties were from indiscriminate airstrikes by government forces and their allies.
"The violations and abuses suffered by people across the country, including the siege and bombardment of eastern Aleppo, are simply not tragedies; they also constitute crimes of historic proportions," Mr. Zeid told the Geneva session.


Facebook Employees Pushed to Remove Trump's Posts as Hate Speech
Some of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's posts on Facebook have set off an intense debate inside the social media company over the past year, with some employees arguing certain posts about banning Muslims from entering the U.S. should be removed for violating the site's rules on hate speech, according to people familiar with the matter.
The decision to allow Mr. Trump's posts went all the way to Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who ruled in December that it would be inappropriate to censor the candidate, according to the people familiar with the matter. That decision has prompted employees across the company to complain on Facebook's internal messaging service and in person to Mr. Zuckerberg and other managers that it was bending the site's rules for Mr. Trump, and some employees who work in a group charged with reviewing content on Facebook threatened to quit, the people said.
"Facebook has never contacted us about employee complaints and has never removed a post," a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump's campaign said. "We are not concerned about the liberal Clinton elites who are so intolerant of conservative ideas that they would seek to censor the Trump campaign's enormously successful Facebook engagement."
In a statement provided Wednesday evening, a Facebook spokeswoman said its reviewers consider the context of a post when assessing whether to take it down. "That context can include the value of political discourse," she said. "Many people are voicing opinions about this particular content and it has become an important part of the conversation around who the next U.S. president will be."
On Friday, senior members of Facebook's policy team posted more details on its policy. "In the weeks ahead, we're going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest—even if they might otherwise violate our standards," they wrote.


Colombia, Rebels to Negotiate New Peace Pact in Cuba
BOGOTA, Colombia—A government negotiating team will meet with rebel commanders in Cuba on Saturday to try and draft a new peace agreement that would be palatable to all sides in this increasingly polarized country, the government's lead negotiator said in an interview.
Humberto de la Calle said Friday that the goal is to return from Havana with an accord that would be presented to both supporters and opponents of a peace pact that was rejected by voters in an Oct. 2 referendum. Opponents have proposed dozens of modifications to President Juan Manuel Santos's government.
A new accord is viewed by the government and its political adversaries as the only way to replace the original deal, which was signed in September after four years of talks.
"The challenge we have is to sit there and see if we can bridge the gap between the No camp and the FARC," Mr. de la Calle said. "What's the possibility of success? It's impossible to predict."
"What we have to do is sit down with the FARC as of tomorrow with the 100 proposals that have come from the No [side] and examine what is viable," he said.


Former Official Declines to Answer Questions in Clinton Email Lawsuit
WASHINGTON—A former State Department official invoked his constitutional right not to answer questions Monday as part of a lawsuit stemming from Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while serving in the government.
John Bentel, who served as a top information technology staffer during Mrs. Clinton's time as secretary of state, declined to answer more than 90 questions as part of a deposition in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department, according to the conservative group Judicial Watch, which brought the lawsuit.
As part of the suit, Judicial Watch was granted permission to interview a number of current and former State Department officials about how and why Mrs. Clinton used a home-based email server for all her government business. The lawsuit seeks records from Mrs. Clinton's time in office.
A judge also ordered Mrs. Clinton to answer written questions but declined to require her to testify in person. She isn't a defendant in the lawsuit.
"As is standard, the department cannot comment as this matter is in ongoing litigation. Beyond that, we would refer you to Mr. Bentel and his representatives," a State Department official said.


Pentagon Chief Vows to End Soldier Bonus Controversy
WASHINGTON—U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter vowed Tuesday to resolve a burgeoning controversy over Pentagon efforts to claw back millions of dollars in re-enlistment bonuses from current and former California National Guard soldiers, many of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mr. Carter, speaking during a press conference in Paris, said he was aware of the issue and had tasked the Pentagon's No. 2 official, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, with fixing the problem.
"Anybody who volunteers to serve in the armed forces of the United States deserves our gratitude and respect. Period," Mr. Carter said in response to a question. "I am aware of the specific issue that you're speaking of. It has got complexities to it, and we are going to look into it and resolve it."
Mr. Carter didn't spell out how officials would resolve the problem. During the early 2000s, the California National Guard awarded thousands of soldiers with bonuses to persuade them to re-enlist, as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan drove demand for military manpower and strained U.S. military forces.
But the Guard doled out many bonuses erroneously, in some cases giving money to soldiers who weren't entitled to the awards. In 2012, a U.S. District Judge sentenced a former official of the California National Guard's to 30 months in federal prison for submitting more than $15 million in false claims to the Department of Defense.


Brazil Turns Away From Establishment Politicians
SÃO PAULO—Even as President Michel Temer struggles to assure investors that Brazil is politically stable and open for business, a continuing series of municipal elections show restless voters fed up with Brazil's entire ruling class and willing to gamble on unconventional newcomers.
Mr. Temer's centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, has little chance to score big gains during the Oct. 30 final round of nationwide balloting for mayors and city council members, having essentially treaded water in the first round on Oct. 2.
Brazil's leftist Workers' Party, or PT, is already slotted as the clear loser, having won less than half the 644 seats it won in the first round four years ago. Voters registered lingering outrage with impeached former President Dilma Rousseff's scandal-plagued government.
But in a pattern now familiar from other elections and polls in Europe and the Americas, losses among high-profile incumbents—and victories by renegade candidates and new parties—suggest voter anger and disgust directed across the political status quo, analysts said.
"I think that, more than a rejection of the PT, it was a movement of rejection of politics," said Lara Mesquita, a professor at the Foundation School of Sociology and Politics in São Paulo.


Rolling Stone Found Liable for Defamation in Retracted Rape Story
A federal jury on Friday dealt a potentially costly legal blow to Rolling Stone magazine and a reporter in a defamation trial over its discredited 2014 story about an alleged fraternity party gang rape at the University of Virginia.
A 10-person jury in Richmond, Va., found that Rolling Stone defamed a university administrator who was in charge of handling student complaints of sexual misconduct at the school.
The case centered on journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely's November 2014, 9,000-word article, "A Rape on Campus," which described an alleged brutal sexual assault of a female college student at a UVA fraternity house and depicted school officials as indifferent to her plight.
The article sparked a national outcry as a shocking example of campus sexual violence. It later became a journalism scandal when the story's central claims unraveled.
In a lawsuit filed last year, then-UVA associate dean of students Nicole Eramo alleged that the article and interviews Ms. Erdely gave about her reporting cast the administrator as the callous villain of its tale and falsely asserted that she discouraged a student identified only as "Jackie" from taking her rape allegations to the police.


Judge Rules Colorado Voters Can Post Ballot Selfies Online
DENVER—A judge ruled that Colorado voters can post ballot selfies on social-media sites, differing from recent federal court decisions on the laws just before Election Day.
U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello ruled late Friday that Colorado can't enforce an 1891 law preventing voters from disseminating their marked ballots. The ruling said polling places may still enforce local rules banning photography due to privacy concerns. However, no resident will be prosecuted for sharing images of completed ballots on social media.
The order comes the same week that judges in New York and California upheld bans, saying changing the rules so close to the election would create confusion for voters and polling place workers.
Colorado election officials testified about those concerns.
"By issuing an injunction in this case, Coloradans get what they are entitled to—clarity on an issue that implicates fundamental constitutional rights," Judge Arguello wrote in her ruling.


Ron Johnson Wins Wisconsin Senate Race
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin beat back a strong bid from former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, rallying the state's highly organized conservatives to his side despite their ambivalence for the party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump.
Mr. Johnson won with 51.9% of the vote to Mr. Feingold's 45.2%, with the Associated Press calling the race with 69% of precincts reporting.
It was a race of stark contrasts. Mr. Johnson, 61 years old, a former businessman who helped build a plastics company in Oshkosh, couldn't be more different from his challenger, Mr. Feingold, an avowed liberal who held the seat for three terms, starting in 1993, before Mr. Johnson ousted him in the Republican wave in 2010.
Mr. Feingold, 63, started his campaign from a position of strength, pointing to his work in Washington reining in campaign spending as the author of a 2002 law with John McCain (R., Ariz.) that was aimed at reducing the influence of money in politics.
But Mr. Johnson was able to turn things around over the course of the campaign by carefully positioning himself in relation to Mr. Trump—and taking advantage of a surge of outside spending in the last several weeks.


Voter Turnout Fell, With Biggest Declines in Urban Areas
In Detroit, Hillary Clinton's winning margin was 90,000 votes smaller than President Barack Obama's in 2012. In Flint, Mich., where a water crises drew visits by both presidential candidates, the Democratic 2012 winning margin of 57,000 votes was cut by two-thirds.
Turnout was down Tuesday, preliminary estimates show, but not uniformly. In urban areas that drive the Democratic tally in much of the industrial Midwest, there were signs African-American enthusiasm for Mr. Obama didn't fully transfer to Mrs. Clinton.
In some of the smaller communities that powered Republican Donald Trump to victory, meanwhile, turnout appeared to rise. The number of votes cast statewide rose in Pennsylvania and Florida—formerly Democratic states that Mr. Trump won—as well as in Michigan, where he was maintaining a lead.
But nationwide, fewer voters went to the polls. Mr. Trump appeared to have won the election, in fact, with fewer votes than GOP nominee Mitt Romney drew in his losing 2012 race. Mr. Trump in preliminary totals had about 59.6 million votes, 1.6 million shy of his party's total in the last election.
The overall picture was of a decline in Democratic support in urban areas combined with a big increase in Republican margins in many communities outside urban areas.


GOP Committee Chairman to Continue Clinton Email Probe
WASHINGTON—House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) said he would continue to focus on Hillary Clinton's email practices from her time as secretary of state, although she last week lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.
"Task number one is to get what are literally tens of thousands of documents out of the State Department," Mr. Chaffetz said on Monday. "The administration has given us a stiff arm for years, and hopefully now it will get loosened up."
The State Department is in the process of releasing several thousand emails forensically recovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Mrs. Clinton's time heading the agency.
Mr. Chaffetz's comments contrast with the position taken by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who said over the weekend that he was setting an agenda for the Republican party focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act, replacing jobs, and boosting investment in infrastructure. Speaking on Fox News about investigating Mrs. Clinton, he said "I leave that portion to law enforcement. That's just the way I do it. Keep politics out of it."
Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, declined to comment other than to note that Mr. McCarthy had ruled out continuing such investigations into Mrs. Clinton. Democrats have moved on, and are now focused on Mr. Trump's business holdings, with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), the top Democrat on Mr. Chaffetz's panel, calling for a review of Mr. Trump's investments to ensure the president-elect doesn't have any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.


Racial Incidents Seem Linked to Election
In California, a high-school student distributed fake deportation letters to minority students. At the University of Pennsylvania, black students discovered they had been added to a text-message chat group that used racist language and depicted an image of a lynching. In Maryland, a church banner announcing a Spanish-language service was defaced with the words "Trump Nation: Whites Only."
The incidents in the past week came as thousands marched against Donald Trump's election in cities including New York, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., criticizing his campaign rhetoric against illegal immigrants and Muslims. Though the protests have been largely peaceful, hundreds have been arrested after vandalism and clashes with police in some cities.
Mr. Trump, when asked on Sunday night's "60 Minutes" on CBS about the reports of racial slurs and threats against minorities, he said he hadn't heard of them. "I am very surprised to hear that," he said. "I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that."
When pressed, he said, "I am so saddened to hear that..I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras—stop it!"
Mr. Trump is striking a more presidential tone as he makes the transition from a divisive campaign to the White House. He pledged to be a leader for "all Americans" in his acceptance speech Wednesday.


A Columnist's Responsibility
In 2008 and 2012 I wrote columns opposing Barack Obama's bid for the White House. I thought he was an overrated talker grandiosely promising the transformation and redemption of an America that needed neither. The cult of personality that went with his candidacy creeped me out. People who wore T-shirts with the candidate posed as a prophet reminded me of religious believers, not democratic citizens.
I've never regretted my opposition to Mr. Obama, though I've never wished him ill. Nor do I regret other positions that earned me no favors from readers, from my opposition to Jonathan Pollard's early release to my support for keeping troops in Afghanistan (for which the journalist Michael Wolff urged people to punch me in the face). There are columnists who take excellent care to stay on their audience's good side. Not me.
But nothing quite prepared me for the torrent of opprobrium stemming from my undiminished disdain for Donald Trump. In August 2015 I called him a "loudmouth vulgarian appealing to quieter vulgarians." Last week, I said he was a demagogue. I've lost count of the number of readers informing me—usually more than once—that they've canceled subscriptions on my account, or demanding that I apologize, resign or move to Israel. His victory last week has redoubled those demands.
To which my considered reply is: Non, je ne regrette rien.
Well, not entirely. I was almost certain Mr. Trump would lose the election. Nobody should ever hire me as a political forecaster. I took too many shots at Mr. Trump's voters rather than at the candidate himself. Millions of voters in the general election were not blind to his faults but chose him as the lesser evil. They deserved less scorn and more understanding.


A Look Behind the Curtain of Trumponomics
Since Donald Trump will be America's next president, it behooves us to contemplate what Trumponomics might actually do to—not for—the U.S. economy. His campaign proposals were an odd mélange of slogans, like "build a wall" and "it will be great," and reliable old saws of Republican economics, like massive tax cuts. Since we don't know who will be whispering in his ear in the Oval Office (other than chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and alt-right chief strategist, Steve Bannon) the best we can do now is guess. ​
I'll start with three easy ones.
• Tax cuts. Congressional Republicans always want to cut taxes on the non-needy, and they are all too willing to bust the budget to do so. With Republican majorities in both Houses, pushing something resembling the Trump tax proposals through Congress should be a piece of cake.
The tax cuts will balloon the deficit, of course. But that's something Republicans worry about only when a Democrat occupies the White House. Both President Reagan and President George W. Bush pushed through lavish tax cuts with no ways to pay for them. The good news here is that the Trump tax cuts will put the economy on a sugar high—which is probably why the stock market cheered and inflationary expectations rose.
• Climate change. A second excellent bet is that the U.S. will cease being a positive force in the battle against global climate change and become an implacable foe instead. After all, the president-elect thinks the whole thing is a hoax. And it's really easy to wield the wrecking ball here. All he needs to do is ignore the commitments made by President Obama, and the Paris climate agreement will be in shambles. Canada will become warmer, too.


Sarkozy Is Knocked Out of Race for French Presidency
PARIS—Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign to reclaim the French presidency came to an abrupt end after a surge of support for his former prime minister, notching another upset in a year of electoral upheaval for the West's political establishment.
Mr. Sarkozy, who centered his campaign on pledges for hard-line security measures and a clampdown on immigration, was hobbled in the conservative primary race by François Fillon, his once-close ally who ran on a pledge to deliver a shock to the French economy with deep spending cuts and labor overhauls.
Less than a month ago, polls credited Mr. Fillon with less than 15% of the first-round vote. On Sunday, results from 9,347 of the 10,229 polling stations across the country showed he won 44.2% of the votes in a field of seven candidates, ahead of the 28.5% received by Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppé, who recent polls showed had been the favorite to win the primary. Mr. Sarkozy, by contrast, won just 20.6% of votes.
"Hope has shown itself with strength everywhere in France, demolishing all the predictions," Mr. Fillon said.
Mr. Fillon and Mr. Juppé will now advance to a runoff next Sunday. Mr. Sarkozy, who conceded defeat late Sunday, said he would throw his support behind Mr. Fillon. "It is time for me to attempt a life with more private passion and less public passion," Mr. Sarkozy said.


Trump Raises Prospect of Keeping Ties to His Firms
Donald Trump indicated Tuesday he was unlikely to disentangle himself from his business empire as fully as he previously suggested, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest while president.
Mr. Trump and his representatives said during the campaign he would have nothing to do with his businesses if he became president, promising a "total and complete separation."
But since the election, Mr. Trump has met with foreign business partners and involved daughter Ivanka Trump in such discussions, even though he has said his children will run his companies during the presidency as a way to separate their operations from the White House.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told the New York Times that "the law's totally on my side" and that "the president can't have a conflict of interest."
Mr. Trump's comments came after the Republican contended with other concerns overhanging his transition. Trump University disclosed a $25 million settlement Friday to resolve litigation involving allegations of fraud at the defunct organization. And Mr. Trump's charitable foundation said in a tax filing that it had engaged in self-dealing in 2015 and prior years that resulted from payments to "disqualified persons," or foundation insiders.


Trump Allies Raise Doubts About Romney Posting
An internal debate over President-elect Donald Trump's secretary-of-state appointment has spilled into the open, with some prominent Republicans close to Mr. Trump arguing for a loyal supporter to fill the post rather than longtime critic Mitt Romney.
Trump adviser and former Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway issued a series of tweets Thursday morning in which she appeared to question the former Massachusetts governor's suitability for a role working alongside Mr. Trump.
Ms. Conway said she had received a "deluge" of social-media and private communications about Mr. Romney. In a second tweet, she added that previous secretaries of state such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz "flew around the world less, counseled POTUS [president of the United States] close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist."
The debate over the State Department job has been marked by an internal tug of war in the Trump camp between supporters of Mr. Romney, those favoring former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani—a longtime Trump ally favored by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich—and others who believe Mr. Trump should keep searching for candidates.
Two people in Mr. Trump's camp this week said he was leaning toward Mr. Romney, but Ms. Conway's tweets suggest the issue hasn't been settled. Representatives for Mr. Trump didn't return requests for comment, nor did Mr. Romney's representative. Mr. Trump has said he is the only one who knows who the finalists are for his picks.


A Presidential Scandal Transfixes South Korea
SEOUL—South Korean President Park Geun-hye grew up with few close friendships, reared in the gilded cage of the presidential palace as the daughter of a military dictator.
Now, one friendship Ms. Park does have has imperiled her presidency.
The friend, the daughter of a cult leader who once claimed to speak with Ms. Park's murdered mother, sought to enrich herself through ties to the presidential office, South Korean prosecutors have alleged in an extortion indictment. The friend also received access to classified presidential policy documents, they say.
The snowballing political drama is paralyzing the government of South Korea, a close U.S. ally, at a time when the Obama administration considers North Korea and its increasingly aggressive nuclear strategy to be the top national security priority for the next administration.
Prosecution documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal say that foundations set up by the president's friend, a 60-year-old woman named Choi Soon-sil, allegedly used her presidential ties to wrest millions of dollars in donations from Korean conglomerates. Prosecutors have raided most of South Korea's biggest business groups seeking evidence. Some of the money, prosecutors believe, went to pay for Ms. Choi's affluent lifestyle and her daughter's equestrian aspirations.


Fidel Castro's Death Casts Doubt on Cuba-U.S. Relations
WASHINGTON—The death of Fidel Castro further clouds the future of President Barack Obama's effort to restore U.S. relations with Cuba, as both countries undergo momentous political transitions.
Top advisers to President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that he may reverse the historic diplomatic opening Mr. Obama embarked on unless concessions are made.
"There's going to have to be some movement from Cuba in order to have a relationship with the United States," said Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, speaking on Fox News Sunday. He said Cuban leaders will have to show distinct progress on lifting repression, freeing political prisoners, opening markets and assuring religious freedom.
Senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Mr. Trump "is open to resetting relations with Cuba" but won't make concessions without getting a series of unspecified demands in return.
"To the extent that a President Trump can open up new conversations with Cuba, it would have to be a very different Cuba," she said on ABC's This Week.


Damascus Presses Offensive Against Aleppo Rebels
Syrian regime shelling killed at least 40 civilians fleeing fierce fighting in east Aleppo on Wednesday, local opposition officials and activists said, as President Bashar al-Assad's forces pursue an offensive on rebel-held parts of the city.
More than 20,000 residents are estimated to have fled the fighting in rebel-held areas in the past few days, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, amid continuing aerial bombardment.
Rebels have lost about a third of their territory in the city in recent days, and the violence is causing further deterioration of difficult living conditions as desperate people fleeing their homes struggle to find shelter.
Shells and rockets hit civilians on Wednesday in the neighborhood of Jub al-Quba, where displaced people were seeking shelter from the onslaught, said Mosaab Khalaf, a member of the local opposition council, and the U.K.-based opposition monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The dead were mostly women and children, they said, and dozens of others were wounded.
The Russian military has backed the recent Syrian government offensive, but Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said on Wednesday that Russian aircraft were staying outside a 10-kilometer boundary outside of Aleppo. Residents, activists and monitoring groups have for months accused Russia of bombarding eastern neighborhoods.


Tennessee Wildfires Death Toll Reaches 13
The death toll from the wildfires that tore through Sevier County in eastern Tennessee climbed to 13 on Friday, with the victims including an elderly couple visiting from Canada, a husband and wife from Memphis and one person who suffered a heart attack while trying to escape the flames.
Wind-fueled wildfires forced evacuations Monday night in the Tennessee towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, popular tourist spots in the Smoky Mountains. Thousands fled homes and businesses, including Dolly Parton's amusement park Dollywood.
Investigators continue to probe the cause of the fire, which appears to have been caused by humans, Great Smoky Mountains National Park Supt. Cassius Cash reiterated Friday. Officials announced three additional deaths from the fires at a news conference Friday, while also defending themselves against questions over the pace of the evacuation.
Officials also said they sent emergency notifications to mobile devices telling people to evacuate on Monday night but acknowledged some people didn't get the notices because of power outages, lost cellphone reception and other complications.
The fires were the worst in the Tennessee in 100 years, according to Gov. Bill Haslam.


Italy's 'No' Poses Trouble for Eurozone
BRUSSELS—Sunday's referendum vote in Italy reinforced a widening split between the economics needed to sustain Europe's common currency and the continent's rising tide of populism.
Italians resoundingly rejected constitutional changes aimed at streamlining lawmaking and boosting competitiveness, marking a sobering start to what could be a defining year ahead for the European Union.
National elections are set for 2017 in three of the bloc's founding members. Sunday's vote makes it more likely that Italy, too, will have parliamentary polls next year.
In all of these countries, mainstream parties have been losing ground to populist movements, many of them on the far right. To be sure, in Austria, however, voters on Sunday turned back the presidential bid of a right-wing populist Norbert Hofer, who campaigned on curbing immigration and reinstating national borders. Green party leader Alexander Van der Bellen prevailed with more than 53% of the vote for the largely ceremonial position.
The biggest winner from Sunday's ballot in Italy was Beppe Grillo, a comedian-turned-politician, and his populist 5 Star Movement, which wants a nonbinding referendum on Italy's membership in the euro, an end to EU-mandated government-spending limits and income guarantees for all citizens.


Uzbekistan Election Likely a Rubber Stamp for Acting President
Voters in Uzbekistan went to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president following the death of longtime authoritarian leader Islam Karimov.
The vote, likely to rubber stamp the rule of acting president Shavkat Mirziyoyev, was carried out peacefully. Analysts, however, criticized the election saying the politician's victory was nearly a foregone conclusion in the tightly controlled political system that reins in the economically depressed, Muslim country.
Mr. Mirziyoyev had been prime minister in Uzbekistan, Central Asia's most populous country, since 2003. But following the death of Mr. Karimov in September from complications after a stroke, he quickly circumvented the constitution to assert himself as acting president.
Preliminary results of the election were expected late Sunday or early Monday.
Running against Mr. Mirziyoyev are representatives from three of Uzbekistan's sanctioned parties: Sarvar Otamuradov, of Uzbekistan National Revival Democratic Party; Narimon Umarov, of the Justice Social Democratic Party and Khatamjon Ketmonov of the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan. Mr. Mirziyoyev is running as a candidate from the country's fourth sanctioned party: The Liberal Democratic Party of Uzbekistan.


For Europe's Unity, 2017 Will Be a Year of Reckoning
BOLZANO, Italy—Demands from the gathering forces of European populism range from erecting border fences to dismantling the euro. Some insurgent parties want greater fiscal leeway from Europe. Others want their money back from neighboring nations.
They share one thing: Their ideas would unravel the 60-year project of European integration.
These diverse antiestablishment forces have yet to win power in any of the European Union's core countries. Even so, they are piling pressure on mainstream parties, pulling EU countries in different directions as their governments try to assuage a growing public conviction that Europe isn't working.
A string of elections in 2017 will test whether the populist forces can beat mainstream politicians. A political revolt against Europe's status quo that began in Greece and the U.K. will come to a head in France, Germany, the Netherlands and probably Italy. The outcome could eventually, if not immediately, determine the fate of the EU, with its open internal borders and common currency.
At the heart of the new European question, and of many national contests, lies disillusionment over the burdens of life in the euro and anger about a perceived loss of control over immigration. Sunday's referendum in Italy and presidential election in Austria suggest Europeans are split between those who reject what the EU stands for and those who believe it needs change to survive.


Judgment Day Arrives for South Korean President Park
SEOUL—South Korean lawmakers are set to decide today on the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, in a vote that will likely unsettle the country regardless of the outcome.
(Latest: Park Geun-hye Impeached by South Korean National Assembly)
Most political analysts expect two-thirds of the National Assembly's 300 lawmakers to vote to impeach Ms. Park, who has been accused by prosecutors of sharing confidential documents with a longtime friend and helping her extract money from business groups like the Samsung and Hyundai conglomerates.
If Ms. Park is impeached, her executive powers will be suspended immediately and the final decision on removal falls to the country's nine-member Constitutional Court. If six of the court's members agree on the impeachment, Ms. Park would be immediately removed from office and a snap election would follow within two months.
In the interim period, the country's prime minister acts as president.


The Spoils of the Republican State Conquest
In the war of ideas, a think tank is like a munitions factory, churning out the matériel to push the trench line a few miles forward. As luck would have it, Republican state lawmakers will be well equipped next year when they begin one of the largest conservative offensives in recent memory. Come January the GOP will hold "trifectas"—total control of both legislative chambers and the governorship—in 25 states, up from 10 in 2009.
If lawmakers have any questions about where to begin, one place with answers is the State Policy Network, a federation of 65 free-market think tanks ranging from Anchorage, Alaska, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. "At the end of the day, people want jobs. They want security. That's our bread and butter," says Tracie Sharp, the group's president. "We feel like for such a time as this, we've built up this network. We need to really run. This is a state moment."
She seems to mean that in two ways. The first is the obvious: What can conservatives get done in capitals nationwide, and how can her think tanks help? Ms. Sharp says that lawmakers, especially in small states, are hungry for economic analysis: "If I raise taxes, what, really, does it do? Does it create jobs or does it drive jobs out?"
That doesn't necessarily mean producing dusty policy reports. "In the early days, there was a lot of ivory tower, highfalutin, white paper stuff," Ms. Sharp says. "That is one way I think the network has really evolved in the last 10 years is to be able to communicate and message the ideas to the average American."
Take Tennessee, where earlier this year the network's Beacon Center led what its president called an "all-out siege" on the state's Hall Tax, a 6% levy on investment income. Beacon made a football-themed video ad arguing that the tax hurt seniors and drove jobs to Florida. The think tank then used what's called "geo-fencing" to serve the ad to cellphones only within a certain set of coordinates—the capitol building.


Republican Wins Louisiana Runoff Election for U.S. Senate Seat
John Kennedy, the Republican state treasurer of Louisiana, won the state's U.S. Senate race on Saturday, giving Republicans a 52-seat majority in the new Senate next year.
With 32% of the vote counted, Mr. Kennedy was declared the winner over his Democratic rival Foster Campbell, a cattle farmer and state utility regulator, 63% to 37%, in a special runoff election triggered by Louisiana's unique election rules.
The win by Mr. Kennedy helps solidify GOP control of the Senate when the new Congress convenes in January. But that still leaves a slim margin for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who will be responsible for passing much of President-elect Donald Trump's ambitious agenda through a closely divided chamber.
The Democrats will have 46 senators when the new members are sworn in Jan. 3, along with two independents, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucus with them.
Meanwhile, two vulnerable Democratic members, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are being considered positions in the Trump administration. Their move to a Trump administration post could give Republicans additional seats given the competitive politics in both states.


Trump Likely to Nominate Exxon's Tillerson for Secretary of State
President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state, a transition official said Saturday, a selection that would reach outside the traditional foreign policy establishment to elevate a global business deal-maker.
Mr. Trump hasn't yet made a final decision, the official said, but the president-elect heaped praise on Mr. Tillerson in an interview released Saturday.
"He's more than a business executive; he's a world-class player,'' Mr. Trump told Fox News in the interview, to be broadcast Sunday. "He's in charge of I guess the largest company in the world."
Mr. Trump called it "a great advantage" that Mr. Tillerson already knows "many of the players," noting that he does "massive deals in Russia."
Those deals would be certain to come under scrutiny in confirmation hearings before the Senate. A number of Republicans have urged Mr. Trump to be wary of Russia, warning that it is trying to expand its influence in ways that run counter to U.S. interests in places such as Ukraine and Syria.


Islamic State Retakes Ancient City of Palmyra
Islamic State fighters retook the ancient city of Palmyra on Sunday, an embarrassing setback for thousands of Syrian government troops and their Russian allies defending the area after it was captured from the extremists early this year.
Palmyra's loss could strain already overstretched government forces, as the Syrian military redirects troops from other front lines where they were notching important gains, and make it harder to resupply troops deployed in the north and east of the country from Damascus.
Syrian forces had evacuated Palmyra by the afternoon, repositioning themselves on its outskirts and preparing for a counterattack, Talal al-Barazi, the governor of Homs province, where the city is located, said on Sunday night.
Russian warplanes continued to pound Islamic State fighters in the city, and the terror group was sending reinforcements from its other redoubts in Syria, Mr. Barazi added.
"This morning, most civilians were evacuated [from the city]," he said, though only a fraction of Palmyra's residents had returned after the Syrian military and allies ousted Islamic State in March.


Guess Who's Defending Dodd-Frank
There goes another liberal fantasy. In progressive lore, giant banks hate the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and would like nothing more than to return to a regulatory wild west. So why has it been so hard since the Republican election sweep to find a Wall Street CEO who favors the repeal of Dodd-Frank?
J.P. Morgan 's Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs have urged against repeal, and other bank CEOs are also suggesting policy small-ball rather than wholesale reform. Mr. Blankfein, who will have former colleagues as senior policy makers in the Trump Administration, in particular is in a position to encourage significant change.
But last year he explained why that's not necessarily in Goldman's interest. After describing how regulatory costs have helped raise the barriers to entry in his business "higher than at any other time in modern history," Mr. Blankfein forecast more opportunities for global giants like Goldman to gain market share, as "only a handful of players" will likely be able "to effectively compete on a global basis."
Last week the presidents of four trade associations representing banks and credit unions also urged deregulatory restraint in a letter to Senate leaders regarding Dodd-Frank's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Readers of these columns are aware of the bureau's abusive investigations and the fact that it draws its budget automatically from the Federal Reserve so it never has to answer to Congressional appropriators.
But the only major change requested by the bank lobbyists is to create a bipartisan commission to replace the bureau's lone director. Since federal judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals have already ruled the bureau's single-director model unconstitutional, the banks are simply asking lawmakers to fix an illegal defect so the bureau can continue regulating outside of presidential authority.


Confirmation Battle Looms for Tillerson as Secretary of State
WASHINGTON—Donald Trump pushed ahead Tuesday with his controversial pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson, setting up a likely battle with senators—including some Republicans—who have raised questions about his closeness to Russian leaders.
Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, influential voices in the chamber on foreign-policy issues, want to use the confirmation process to explore Mr. Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Rubio went the furthest, saying Tuesday he had "serious concerns" about the nominee.
The worries from Republicans signaled Mr. Tillerson could face trouble getting confirmed in the Senate, where he could lose no more than two GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.
Mr. Tillerson was officially unveiled as the president-elect's choice Tuesday morning after a long interview process that featured multiple candidates, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump called the executive's life story the "embodiment of the American dream" and suggested his business background would empower Mr. Tillerson to cut deals as America's top diplomat.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) praised Mr. Tillerson for his "forward-looking strategic planning, managing international partnerships and risk, and focused leadership around the world." He played down concerns over Mr. Tillerson's ties to Russia by saying he was confident he "will face each problem head on with American interests and security as his top priority."


China Installs Weapons in South China Sea, Satellites Show
BEIJING—A U.S. think-tank report that China has installed antiaircraft weapons and other arms on all seven islands it has built in the South China Sea is raising the stakes in a regional dispute as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump signals he is ready to confront Beijing on territorial issues.
The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said Wednesday that satellite imagery showed China had installed the weapons in recent months, despite President Xi Jinping's pledge not to militarize the islands in the Spratly archipelago, where Beijing's territorial claims overlap with those of several other governments.
China's Defense Ministry reiterated in a statement on its website Thursday that any reef construction was mainly for civil use, though it appeared to also send a message to the U.S. "As to the necessary military facilities, they are mainly for defense and self-defense, which is appropriate and legal. For example, if someone is showing off their strength on your doorstep, can't you even prepare a slingshot?" the statement said.
China's island-building over the past three years has raised fears in the U.S. and among its Asian allies and partners that Beijing plans to use its expanding military power to enforce its territorial claims and to take control of a shipping route that carries more than $5 trillion of world trade annually.
In Washington, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, blasted the Chinese and demanded the U.S. take action against the weaponry.


Former Milwaukee Officer Charged With Homicide in Shooting That Sparked Riots
A former Milwaukee police officer was charged Thursday with first-degree reckless homicide in the fatal shooting of a young black man that sparked two days of riots in August.
In court documents, authorities said 24-year-old Dominique Heaggan-Brown fired at 23-year-old Sylville Smith after Mr. Smith threw a firearm over a fence and was unarmed. Mr. Smith's gun was never discharged.
After the officer's first shot hit Mr. Smith, he fell to the ground. Mr. Heaggan-Brown, who is also black, fired a second shot at his chest, as Mr. Smith had his hands up and near his head, according to court documents.
The incident was captured on body cameras worn by officers but footage hasn't been made public, and authorities haven't indicated that they will release the video soon. Protesters had demanded that city officials release the video of the shooting as has been done in other cities after officer-involved shootings.
Milwaukee officials said after the shooting—which led to two days of riots in the predominantly African-American Sherman Park neighborhood where businesses were set ablaze—that Mr. Smith was carrying a stolen handgun and had pointed it at the officer before he was shot.


North Carolina Governor Signs Bill Limiting His Successor's Power
North Carolina Republican Gov. Pat McCrory signed a bill Friday that removes some authority from the state's incoming Democratic governor by merging the state's election and ethics boards.
Late Friday afternoon, lawmakers passed more legislation restricting the governor's powers and sent it to Mr. McCrory. He hasn't said whether he would sign that bill, which would limit the ability of his successor, Roy Cooper, to appoint and hire throughout state government, from the universities to cabinet posts to other positions.
"The courts will have to clean up the mess the Legislature made, but it won't stop us from moving North Carolina forward," Gov.-elect Cooper said in a statement Friday afternoon.
The North Carolina actions are the latest example of GOP lawmakers wielding their clout in U.S. statehouses, where they strengthened their hold after last month's election.
The bill Mr. McCrory signed into law strips Mr. Cooper of some of the power he would have when he begins his term Jan. 1, because the newly merged board must be comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans. The previous setup would have allowed Mr. Cooper to appoint more Democrats to the election and ethics boards, if he chose.


The Dictator Who Stole Christmas
It wasn't the decision by Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro to take out of circulation the largest-denomination 100-bolivar note that set off riots and looting across the country on the weekend. It was the dictatorship's failure to provide an orderly mechanism for the public to exchange the old bills for new ones.
But then again, what do you expect from a regime that has put one of South America's most resource-rich nations in a hyperinflationary meltdown?
Mr. Maduro told the country on Dec. 11 that smugglers over the border in Colombia are hoarding the 100-bolivar notes—worth about three U.S. cents—creating a shortage in Venezuela. His solution is to suddenly eliminate these notes as legal tender, thereby damaging what he calls the "mafias" holding them.
Venezuelans were given four days to deposit the notes at commercial banks to credit their accounts, and another three days if they would take them to central bank offices to receive an IOU.
But banks cannot handle the crowds. Plus, an estimated one-third of Venezuelans don't have bank accounts and at least one central-bank office, in Maracaibo, did not open on Friday as promised. On Saturday, in the midst of widespread social unrest, Mr. Maduro extended the deadline to Jan. 2. But millions may still get stuck with worthless paper.


Obama's Midnight Regulation Express
Barack Obama isn't known for humility, though rarely has his lack of grace been more on display than in his final hours in office. The nation rejected his agenda. The president's response? To shove more of that agenda down the nation's gullet.
Notice the growing and many ugly ways the Obama administration is actively working to undermine a Donald Trump presidency. Unnamed administration sources whisper stories about Russian hackers to delegitimize Mr. Trump's election. These whispers began at about the same time Hillary Clinton officials began pressuring electors to defy election results and deny Mr. Trump the presidency. How helpful.
Trump transition-team members report how Obama officials are providing them with skewed or incomplete information, as well as lectures about their duties on climate change. (No wonder Mr. Trump is bypassing those "official" intelligence briefings.) The Energy Department is refusing to provide the transition team with the names of career officials who led key programs, like those who attended U.N. climate talks. Sen. Ron Johnson recently sent a letter to President Obama voicing alarm over "burrowing," in which political appointees, late in an administration, convert to career bureaucrats and become obstacles to the new political appointees.
But perhaps nothing has more underlined the Obama arrogance than his final flurry of midnight regulations. With each new proposed rule or executive order, Mr. Obama is spitefully mocking the nation that just told him "enough."
The technical definition of a midnight regulation is one issued between Election Day and the inauguration of a new president. The practice is bipartisan. George W. Bush, despite having promised not to do so, pushed through a fair number of rules in his final months. But Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were more aggressive, and Mr. Obama is making them look like pikers.


Obama's Anti-Israel Tantrum
The decision by the United States to abstain from a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel over its settlements on the West Bank is one of the most significant, defining moments of the Obama Presidency.
It defines this President's extraordinary ability to transform matters of public policy into personal pique at adversaries. And it defines the reality of the international left's implacable opposition to the Israeli state.
Earlier in the week, Egypt withdrew the Security Council resolution under pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President-elect Donald Trump also intervened, speaking with Egypt's government and, via Twitter , urging Mr. Obama to block the resolution, as have past U.S. Administrations and Mr. Obama himself in 2011.
As was widely reported Friday after the U.N. vote, the White House decided to abstain—thereby allowing the pro-Palestinian resolution to pass—in retaliation against the intervention by Messrs. Netanyahu and Trump.
Mr. Obama's animus toward Prime Minister Netanyahu is well known. Apparently Mr. Obama took it as an affront that the President-elect would express an opinion about this week's U.N. resolution.


Colombia Approves Tax Plan
BOGOTÁ, Colombia—Colombian lawmakers approved a tax-overhaul bill Friday, a relief for President Juan Manuel Santos as his administration seeks to recoup lost oil revenues and maintain its investment-grade sovereign credit rating.
The overhaul, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, allows the government to rake in an extra 6.2 trillion pesos, or $2 billion, in 2017 by raising the value-added sales tax to 19% from 16%. That, economists say, will be enough to appease ratings firms that earlier this year warned of a downgrade unless Colombia compensated for fallen oil prices.
"These are not easy decisions and at first glance can seem unpopular," Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said after the tax overhaul's 46-16 approval in the senate. "But behind it all is the greatest interest of the nation: to progress collectively, to reduce poverty and build infrastructure."
The bill aims to simplify the tax code for businesses, which will see their burden reduced to 33% from 43% by 2019. It also applies new taxes on tobacco and fuel while toughening penalties against tax evaders, who can face four to nine years in prison.
Shoring up finances is crucial for the government as it looks to end a half-century of conflict and implement a peace pact with Marxist rebels over the next six months. The accord calls for increased rural investment and development that will put additional strain on the federal budget, which saw revenue slashed by 3% of gross domestic product since 2014 due to lower oil prices.


Olivia Top Name for Baby Girls Born in New York City in 2015
Stand aside, Sophia. In New York, Olivia is now tops.
One out of every 100 baby girls born in New York City last year was called Olivia, city officials said Wednesday. That ended Sophia's three-year stretch in the No. 1 spot.
Ethan held on to the top spot in boys' names for a second year.
Overall, the number of babies born in the city during 2015 dropped by 411 to 121,673, and boys outnumbered girls, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
The other top names for girls included Emma and Mia, which tied for third place, and Isabella. For boys, Liam, Noah, Jacob and Jayden rounded out the top five most popular names. Jayden had been the city's No. 1 boy name from 2008 to 2013.


Year-End Crunch: Of Cicadas, Volkswagens and Electoral Votes
In 2016, The Numbers interviewed 192 sources in six countries on topics ranging from unemployment to why winning the Powerball is harder than ever, from college admissions to whether children should count on their fingers, from the presidential candidates' speech patterns to the boom-or-bust breeding cycle of the mighty oak.
As the year wraps up, here are a few updates on some of this year's columns:
Volkswagen :
In January, The Numbers looked at how researchers priced the damage caused by diesel-engine Volkswagens rigged with "defeat devices" to violate U.S. emissions standards.
The experts estimated the excess pollution emitted by the vehicles would cost society $450 million for problems ranging from premature deaths to the increased use of asthma inhalers.


Hawaii's Homeless Problem Spurs Fixes, and a Debate
SAND ISLAND, Hawaii—After three months of living in his 1995 Mazda Protégé, Oren Elliott Kong found refuge in a converted shipping container on this industrial islet, reached from Honolulu by a single drawbridge south of the airport.
Mr. Kong, 67 years old, lived for four months in the Hale Mauliola Housing Navigation Service Center, a temporary housing community created by Honolulu officials to address its swelling homeless population. The use of the old shipping container shows the unconventional steps Hawaii is taking to address its homelessness rate—the highest per capita in the nation, according to federal data—but some advocates worry some of the state's actions could ultimately make it harder for the state to house its needy residents.
Hawaii's homeless population increased by nearly 36% since 2010, amid a surge in the cost of living, even as the number of homeless people overall has declined nationwide. The crisis has gotten so bad that Democratic Gov. David Ige has repeatedly declared a state of emergency—a step usually reserved for natural disasters—which allows state officials to bypass regular union and contract rules in providing shelter.
But those moves, as well as Hawaii's new criteria for all state-funded shelters, are spurring a debate. Some observers aren't in favor of using emergency declarations for such a complex issue as homelessness. And shelter providers say the new regulations, requiring more personal space for homeless individuals in shelters, and more toilets and showers, would result in hundreds of fewer beds.


Notable & Quotable: Larry Arnn on Trump
From President Larry P. Arnn, writing in the December edition of Hillsdale College's Imprimis newsletter:
Since the Founding, twelve cabinet offices have been added to the federal establishment. In the original federal government there was a Secretary of State to handle the relations of the American people with other countries. There must be such relations. There was a Secretary of War (now Defense) to manage the defense of our nation from enemies. We have such enemies, and we must defend ourselves. There was a Secretary of the Treasury to manage the budget and the money of the federal government. To operate, the federal government must collect taxes and spend money. And there was an Attorney General (not originally overseeing a department) to enforce the laws of the federal government. One can see that these functions are necessary to the federal government in a way that the functions of other departments are not.
The Department of Education was founded in 1979, whereas Hillsdale College was founded in 1844. Education was a thing to behold in the United States long before there was a Department. Likewise people had houses before we had a Department of Housing and Urban Development; they traveled before we had a Department of Transportation; they traded before we had a Department of Commerce. You can see the line of thought. A federal government with four cabinet officers would be a federal government doing what it has to do. That is why it is breathtaking that Trump would call for the elimination of departments, and breathtaking that he would appoint some and interview others who at least want to restrict the activities of those departments so people can be free.
We do not know what this election means. That is in the future. If it means that we will return to constitutional government, it means the most important thing that it can mean. . . .


Severe Storms Kill Four in Alabama
Emergency officials said four people were killed in southern Alabama when severe storms ripped through the area.
Kris Ware, a spokeswoman for the Dothan Houston County Emergency Management Agency, said four people were killed in Rehobeth, and structures were damaged in the area.
Gov. Robert Bentley said in a statement on social media that the sheriff confirmed the storm-related deaths to him.
The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for Houston County on Monday evening.
Earlier Monday, severe weather exited Louisiana in time for the Sugar Bowl game Monday night between Auburn University and the University of Oklahoma, but thunderstorms and some tornadoes remained a threat in southern Alabama, southwest Georgia and northwest Florida. Those areas remained under a tornado watch until late Monday, as a storm system that began early Monday in Texas kept pushing eastward.


Obama Abandoned the Middle East. Trump Can Help Revive It
The forthcoming change in the White House could mark one of the greatest economic and political opportunities of our lifetime—rebuilding the Middle East. We don't know what policies President-elect Trump plans for the region, but we have been waiting a long time for a U.S. administration to provide leadership.
Even if we didn't agree with every move George W. Bush made, we understood that he considered the region a priority within a robust U.S. foreign policy. We had high hopes for Barack Obama, who, in his June 2009 Cairo speech, spoke eloquently about re-engaging with the region, a message received well by the Muslim world. But while the president's rhetoric that day was stirring, the policies told us something else: The U.S. was abandoning the region.
The leadership void created by an America in retreat was filled by once-forgotten countries—Russia, China, Iran—taking a more active role, unnecessarily complicating geopolitical realities. Retreating U.S. leadership has also contributed to an intractable war in Syria and the worst refugee crisis since World War II. It has given us the scourge of Islamic State and proxy fights among neighborhood powers Iran and Saudi Arabia. Respect for American leadership has declined significantly throughout the region and skepticism runs high. For allies that aspire first and foremost to build and maintain a positive relationship with the U.S., it is getting harder to wait for America to step up.
The situation is urgent. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that more than 30% of the population in the Middle East and North Africa is between the ages of 15 and 24. Youth unemployment in the Middle East will reach 30% by 2018, as estimated by the International Labor Organization. Putting our youth to work would provide a positive outlook for our economies while reducing the hopelessness that can sometimes lead people to a darker path.
As a businessman who has a foot in both the Gulf and the U.S., I know firsthand the nexus of security and economic opportunity. As a father, I worry not only for our children's safety, but also for the chance they will have to create a successful life of their own.


Divide Over Russia Deepens in Congress
WASHINGTON—Congressional Republicans' worries over President-elect Donald Trump's views on Russia are deepening, with GOP hawks saying they still have questions about approving Rex Tillerson for secretary of state days before his scheduled confirmation hearing.
Two key Republicans, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said in a joint interview Sunday on NBC that they are pushing forward with legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia, a move that would contradict Mr. Trump's desire for a rapprochement with the Kremlin. Broad support for such a bill would put pressure on Mr. Trump to go along or risk appearing further isolated from his party on U.S.-Russia relations by vetoing such a measure.
The release Friday of a U.S. intelligence community report that pointed a finger at the Kremlin for interference in the 2016 presidential election is expected to heighten tensions around Mr. Tillerson's confirmation hearings and the full Senate vote on his nomination.
More broadly, the divide over Russia threatens to thwart hopes by Republican leaders for a smooth start that would include rapid confirmation of the Trump cabinet and a quick vote on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats are additionally complaining about the fact that several committees haven't received financial and ethics paperwork that nominees are required to file.
Mr. Trump and his advisers have sought to play down Russia's role and emphasize that the hacking didn't affect the outcome of the election. But continuing U.S. investigations of the hacking are expected to keep the issue alive well into Mr. Trump's presidency. The classified version of the report provided to Mr. Trump, President Barack Obama and some member of Congress said there are ongoing U.S. investigations into the hacking, though their scope remains unclear, according to an individual familiar with the report.


China Sends Aircraft Carrier Through Taiwan Strait
BEIJING—China said Wednesday it was committed to promoting peace and stability in Asia, even as it sent an aircraft carrier battle group through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened tensions between Beijing and the self-ruled island.
The statement in the preface to a Cabinet report on China's policies on Asia-Pacific security cooperation follows heated criticism from the U.S., Japan and others over Beijing's increasingly robust assertions of its maritime claims, particularly in the South China Sea.
The report made no direct reference to such concerns while casting Beijing as a force for economic development and conflict reduction.
The report reiterated China's claims over South China Sea islands and waters, as well as territories in the East China Sea controlled by Japan. It also expressed strong opposition to the deployment by the U.S. and South Korea of an advanced missile-defense system to counter threats from North Korea, saying that would "seriously damage the regional strategic balance and the strategic security interests of China and other countries in the region."
China's rapid military modernization has raised concerns about its intentions, particularly regarding Taiwan, which it claims as its territory. Earlier Wednesday, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it was keeping an eye on China's sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, and its battle group as it passed through the 100-mile-wide strait separating Taiwan from southeastern China.


Tillerson for State
Over several hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Rex Tillerson presented a largely clear-eyed view of Russia and American interests. Though the Secretary of State nominee had tense exchanges—with Marco Rubio over whether Vladimir Putin is a "war criminal," with Tim Kaine on climate change, with others about his claim that Exxon had never "directly lobbied" against Russian sanctions—on the whole it was a sober, informed performance.
This sobriety was in marked contrast to the circus provoked by the publication of allegations—completely unsubstantiated—that the Russians hold compromising information about Donald Trump and worked with his surrogates to influence the 2016 election.
Among the allegations is that Mr. Trump hired prostitutes to perform degrading acts on a bed at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow that had been slept in by President and Mrs. Obama. Another is that Mr. Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, held a "clandestine meeting" with "Kremlin representatives" in Prague last August. These are two items drawn from 35 pages of memos prepared by a former British MI6 officer who was formerly stationed in Russia and who was paid first by Republican opponents of Mr. Trump and then by Democrats.
The memos had been circulating in press and political circles for some time. Yet even many publications that were vociferously anti-Trump declined to publish the material because they couldn't substantiate the claims.
This changed Tuesday. First CNN published a dispatch noting that a summary of the memos had been attached to a report by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking—though CNN did not include the uncorroborated details. The BuzzFeed website then published the 35 pages of memos even as its editor admitted "there is serious reason to doubt the allegations."


Trump's Nominees Diverge on Russia, Security Issues
WASHINGTON—Donald Trump's picks for top national security posts diverged from the president-elect's positions on key issues during confirmation hearings a week before the inauguration, increasing uncertainty about what policies the incoming administration will pursue, even on matters almost entirely under White House control.
Retired Gen. James Mattis, the secretary of defense nominee; Rex Tillerson, named to be secretary of state; and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.), the Central Intelligence Agency director nominee, all made statements at Senate hearings this week that differed from views Mr. Trump has expressed, staking out positions that might help them win approval from the Senate but could set them on a collision course with the incoming White House over critical issues, ranging from Russia to Iran.
The break with Mr. Trump was on display perhaps most prominently this week during the three-hour confirmation hearing Thursday for Gen. Mattis. The defense secretary nominee classified Russia as the principal threat to the U.S. and expressed little hope that Washington would develop a substantive partnership with Moscow, as Mr. Trump has suggested.
As opposed to praising Vladimir Putin, Gen. Mattis accused the Russian president of "trying to break the North Atlantic alliance." The prospective defense chief vowed to proceed with efforts to increase the defenses of European allies against Moscow.
"I'm all for engagement, but we also have to recognize reality and what Russia is up to," Gen. Mattis said. "There are a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively and an increasing number of areas in which we will have to confront Russia."


Poland Welcomes U.S. Troops
WARSAW—Polish leaders welcomed U.S. troops to their country Saturday, with the defense minister expressing gratitude for their arrival and calling it the fulfillment of a dream Poles have had for decades.
The ceremony in the western Polish town of Zagan comes some 23 years after the last Soviet troops left Poland. It marks a new historic moment—the first time Western forces are being deployed on a continuous basis to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastern flank. The move has infuriated Moscow.
"We have waited for you for a very long time," Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz told the troops as snow fell. "We waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east."
The American deployment includes an armored brigade of 3,500 American troops from Fort Carson, Colo. It comes in reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its backing of separatist insurgents in Ukraine's east. Those actions have frightened many in Poland, the Baltic states and other countries in Eastern Europe that were once under Moscow's control.
The Polish government organized several other events across the country, including in downtown Warsaw, to welcome the Americans.


Brazil Supreme Court Judge in Charge of Car Wash Probe Dies in Plane Crash
SÃO PAULO—The Brazilian Supreme Court judge who presided over a landmark corruption probe died Thursday when a small plane carrying him crashed, raising concerns about the future of an investigation that has put scores of the country's politicians and businessmen behind bars.
Teori Zavascki, who was vacationing before reviewing eagerly awaited testimony in the case, was traveling from São Paulo to the coastal resort of Paraty when the Hawker Beechcraft turboprop plane plunged into the sea near Rio de Janeiro just before 2:30 p.m., according to the Brazilian Air Force. Francisco Prehn Zavascki , Mr. Zavascki's son, was the first to confirm his 68-year-old father's death on his Facebook page.
The air force was sending a team to the site of the crash immediately to investigate its cause, a spokesman said, adding that local witnesses had reported heavy rain at the time of the incident.
Márcio Anselmo, one of the federal police officers in charge of the Car Wash corruption probe, called Mr. Zavascki's death "the end of an era" and demanded a thorough investigation into the crash. Rescue workers said they found at least three bodies at the site.
Mr. Zavascki was in charge of all high-court cases related to the country's sprawling investigation into corruption at state oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, which ranks as the biggest probe of its kind in Brazilian history.


Trump Won't Release Tax Returns, Aide Says
A top spokeswoman to President Donald Trump repeated Sunday that he wouldn't release his tax returns, saying that any pressure to do so was removed with his November election.
"The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns; we litigated this all through the election, people didn't care. They voted for him," Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to Mr. Trump, said Sunday on ABC, in response to a question citing a petition posted to the White House website.
Barack Obama's White House created the White House petition platform, and that administration said it would try to respond within 60 days to those petitions that garnered at least 100,000 signatures within 30 days. As of Sunday, the Trump tax return petition had gathered 212,360 signatures, according to the site.
Mr. Trump was the first presidential candidate from a major party since 1976 to release no tax returns. He said repeatedly during the campaign he would release them after what he and his lawyers said was a multiyear Internal Revenue Service audit. Tax returns are protected by federal privacy law, although the IRS has said he could release the returns, regardless of any audit.
Mr. Trump's opponents and even some supporters have said the returns would help illuminate his vast business holdings and sources of income. In early October, the New York Times published parts of Mr. Trump's state tax documents from 1995, showing that the Republican presidential nominee reported a $916 million loss on that year's tax return.


NYC Mayor de Blasio Is Expected to Propose $84.67 Billion Budget
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to roll out an $84.67 billion budget proposal on Tuesday, city officials said.
Mr. de Blasio's budget proposal would increase spending by some $1 billion ahead of the city's current, $83.5 billion budget. It comes at a time when the economy is strong but budget hawks have cautioned against rising pension costs, particularly as the city adds thousands of workers to its payroll.
Moody's , the ratings agency, released a report Monday that said the city had the revenue and economic growth to sustain those increases in spending. Analysts there said while the city's fixed costs from pensions and other obligations have grown by an average of 3.9% over the past five years, the costs remained moderate compared with other major cities.
"That obviously is a budget driver," said Nicholas Samuels, a vice president at Moody's.
"But tax revenue has grown faster than that," he added. "The city has really tremendous economic and revenue generating capacity."


Texas Border Cities React to Border-Wall Plans
MCALLEN, Texas—Some officials and residents in border states that have benefited from stronger ties with Mexico reacted with concern over the potentially negative impact building a wall could have on regional economies, while expressing support for enhanced security along the border.
Wednesday's executive order, coupled with President Donald Trump's vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, have made many who live along the border uneasy about the economic future of the borderlands.
"It sends the wrong message to a pivotal partner and friend," said Steve Ahlenius, president of the chamber of commerce in McAllen, a Texas city of 140,000, long a favorite shopping destination for Mexicans from the city of Monterrey.
Long stretches of the border here are already fenced off—with tall and tightly spaced rust-colored steel beams protruding up from the scrub brush. Like other local business leaders, Mr. Ahlenius said he worried that the optics of a full-fledged effort by Mr. Trump to extend the wall would compel Mexicans to take their business elsewhere.
Others praised the president's actions. Texas Republicans in particular have called for tighter controls and greater enforcement, and said too much of the work on border protection has fallen on the state.


Clues to North Korea's Collapse
North Korean diplomat-turned-defector Thae Yong Ho gave a press conference Wednesday in which he cited rising dissatisfaction among the Pyongyang elite and predicted that Kim Jong Un's days are numbered. That's good news for the Trump Administration, which has limited options for dealing with the North's nuclear-weapons program.
Mr. Thae, who served as the North's No. 2 at the London Embassy until last summer, reported that sanctions are hurting the North Korean state and advised against lifting them in exchange for the usual empty promises to freeze the nuclear program. The defector has previously warned that the North is accelerating its quest to develop nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles by the end of the year.
That's not to say that economic pressure alone is likely to spark regime change. United Nations sanctions were tightened in 2013 and again last year, yet the North Korean economy continues to grow. In part that's because China refuses to cut its trading ties with the Kim regime. But another reason is the emergence in the North of unsanctioned but tolerated private markets.
The market traders, known as "masters of money," have accumulated capital and formed an underground banking system that funds large projects such as construction and mining. Housing and retail projects under way in Pyongyang are financed by these entrepreneurs. Many private companies operate within state-owned companies, which take a cut in return for political cover.
The success of private enterprise has reshaped public attitudes toward the state, which is seen as ineffectual and brutal. Most North Koreans now rely on private income, since state jobs don't pay enough to survive. They buy necessities from the markets, where prices are remarkably stable. This has created a culture of self-reliance and willingness to dodge the regime's rules. The police are dependent on bribes paid by traders. The quasilegal markets also sell DVDs and thumb drives containing the latest movies and television shows from South Korea. Cynicism toward the regime's propaganda is rife now that more North Koreans can see the true living standards in the capitalist South.


Iraqis Who Aided U.S. See Visa Hopes Dim
Iraqi interpreter Laith al-Haydar received multiple death threats for working with the American military at the height of the war in his country. In return for helping the U.S., he and tens of thousands of other Iraqis were promised U.S. immigration visas.
Nearly four years after he applied, the 41-year-old father of two is still waiting for a visa—and now faces a new setback: President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending immigration from several countries with a Muslim majority, including Iraq, and a temporary ban on all refugees.
Mr. Haydar is among roughly 58,000 Iraqi applicants for U.S. immigrant visas and refugee resettlement under federal programs that promised to fast-track entry for Iraqis who worked with the U.S. government and other institutions deemed critical to the U.S.-led effort in Iraq, according to the State Department. A similar program for Afghans who've worked with the U.S. government may also be at risk.
At least one Iraqi and two Afghans who worked with the U.S. government and also qualify for expedited immigration visas were turned away from American ports of entry on Friday and Saturday, a State Department official said, adding that several more were prevented from boarding planes to the U.S.
A substantial backlog of applications remains in part because Congress limits the number of visas that can be granted each year. Frustration with visa delays has now been aggravated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.


Jordan's King to Visit Washington Monday
WASHINGTON—Jordan's King Abdullah II is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Monday and could mark the first Arab leader to meet with President Donald Trump, just days after he signed an executive order that suspended the U.S. refugee program and blocked people from Iraq, Syria and several other Muslim countries from entering the U.S.
Mr. Trump's executive order, signed Friday night, is a version of a campaign promise he made beginning in 2015, but it still caught many off guard in Washington because its details weren't widely shared, even among government agencies. When he signed the executive order at the Pentagon, Mr. Trump said it was meant to prevent "radical Islamic terrorists" from entering the U.S.
Many Democrats and humanitarian organizations denounced the order, saying it is inhumane to refugees and could end up stoking anti-American resentment among Muslims.
A formal visit between King Abdullah II and Mr. Trump hasn't been announced, and it is possible that King Abdullah II will come to Washington and not meet with Mr. Trump. But in an announcement from the Jordanian government, it said King Abdullah II would meet with members of Congress and U.S. administration officials, a reference that often means people in the White House.
Jordan and the U.S. are longtime allies, and U.S. leaders from both parties have counted on close ties with Jordan for years to help with an assortment of issues in the Middle East.


Canada Extends Welcome Amid U.S. Refugee Ban
OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other lawmakers suggested Canada would be willing to take refugees affected by the White House crackdown on entry into the U.S., but officials at a press conference Sunday said there were no immediate measures in the offing to boost the number of refugees in 2017.
Canada has agreed to take 25,000 refugees this calendar year. Officials were also noncommittal on a request by Canada's technology sector to offer visas allowing displaced technology-sector workers to reside in Canada while deciding whether to pursue permanent residency in the country.
On his official Twitter account on Saturday, Mr. Trudeau raised expectations and earned international attention with a message stating: "To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength."
That message generated a flood of support, garnering more than 500,000 "likes" on the social-media platform, and its message was quickly echoed by other Canadian lawmakers at the federal and provincial level, including some right-of-center leaders. The Conservative leader of the province of Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, who has quarreled publicly with Mr. Trudeau over a proposed carbon tax, said his western Canadian government stood ready to help any refugee or immigrant "stranded by the U.S. ban."
Pressed by reporters on whether Canada will move to increase its intake of refugees, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen would say only that the government is reviewing the executive order and "will develop policy options and see what we can move forward with."


Academia Checking on International Students, Faculty After Trump Order
University leaders are scrambling to account for students, researchers and faculty members affected by President Donald Trump's travel ban.
On Saturday, a federal judge blocked parts of the ban, which prohibits people from seven countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—from entering the U.S. for 90 days and pauses the U.S. refugee program for 120 days.
U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, in Brooklyn, N .Y., issued the stay preventing the deportations of refugees, visa holders and other individuals from the seven countries, saying they could cause "irreparable harm" to refugees who face threats in their Muslim-majority countries or have family members already living here.
The judge's ruling doesn't cover individuals who are still overseas.
More than 17,000 students from the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump's order were enrolled at U.S. schools in the 2015-2016 year, according to the Institute of International Education, while more than 2,000 such teachers and researchers were at U.S. colleges and universities.


Notable & Quotable: 'Diversity' at Princeton
From "Diversity for the Sake of Democracy" by Carrie Pritt on Quillette.com, Jan. 24:
"Stand up if you identify as Caucasian."
The minister's voice was solemn. I paused so that I wouldn't be the first one standing, and then slowly rose to my feet. "Look at your community," he said. I glanced around the auditorium obediently. The other students looked as uncomfortable as I felt, and as white.  ̈Thank you," the minister said finally. After we sat down, he went on to repeat the exercise for over an hour with different adjectives in place of "Caucasian": black, wealthy, first-generation, socially conservative. Each time he introduced a new label, he paused so that a new group of students could stand and take note of one another. By the time he was finished, every member of Princeton University's freshman class had been branded with a demographic.
This mandatory orientation event was designed to help us appreciate our diversity as a student body during the first week of classes. But what did it really accomplish? . . . He faced a crowd of singular young adults and essentially told them that their heritage outweighed their humanity. The message was clear: know your kind and stick to it.


State Department Officials Protest Trump Immigration Ban
WASHINGTON—More than 100 State Department diplomats and officials have signed a draft document formally protesting President Donald Trump's immigration and refugee order, provoking a caustic rebuke Monday from the White House and exposing deep divisions within the new U.S. administration.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer warned Monday against undercutting Mr. Trump's agenda and said "career bureaucrats" who don't support his policies should consider leaving government.
"I think that they should either get with the program or they can go," Mr. Spicer said.
The State Department employees, in a "dissent" letter drafted in recent days, warned the White House that its decision to temporarily ban immigration from seven Muslim countries could undercut U.S. counterterrorism operations and threaten national security.
The public dustup less than two weeks after Mr. Trump's inauguration highlighted the difficulties the new administration will likely face in implementing its controversial policies, said current and formal U.S. officials.


Supreme Court Nominee is Low Key, Loves the Outdoors
For U.S. Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, the president's nominee for a U.S. Supreme Court seat, taking a position on the vaunted high court would mean returning to the nation's capital from his home state of Colorado.
But even with physical distance, it may be hard to take the Coloradan out of Judge Gorsuch.
An avid outdoorsman, Judge Gorsuch is known to take advantage of all that Denver, home to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has to offer, including skiing, running, rowing and fly-fishing.
Like most appellate judges, Judge Gorsuch looks for sterling credentials when hiring his law clerks, many of whom have gone on to clerk for the Supreme Court. Another key hiring factor, former clerks say, is making sure the young lawyers are excited about moving to the Mile High City.
The 49-year-old judge takes his clerks on hikes and ski trips around Denver and encourages them to embrace the Colorado lifestyle. An annual ski trip with current and former clerks at Breckenridge Ski Resort serves as both a bonding opportunity and a challenge for those who didn't grow up on the slopes.


U.N. Report Says Civilian Casualties Rising in Afghanistan
KABUL—The United Nations said civilian casualties from fighting last year in Afghanistan hit their highest level since the organization began systematically gathering such data eight years ago.
A report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan on Monday said civilian casualties in the conflict between government forces and insurgents went up 3% from 2015 and included 3,498 dead and 7,920 wounded. The increase of casualties among children was 24%, with 923 deaths and 2,589 wounded, the report said.
Most foreign troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ended its combat mission in support of the Kabul government at the end of 2014. Since then, security has deteriorated, especially in provinces where the country's largest insurgency, the Taliban, have attacked more densely populated communities.
The report said antigovernment elements, mainly the Taliban, were responsible for 61% of the civilian casualties last year, while government forces were to blame for 20% and pro-government armed groups and international military forces, 2% each. The remainder, the report said, couldn't be attributed to any side or were caused by unexploded ordnance.
The Taliban, which has been fighting the central government since 2001, called U.N. findings biased. "The Kabul government and the invading forces are the cause of the civilian casualties," said a spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid.


Breakaway N.Y. Senate Democrats Face Greater Scrutiny by Constituents
An alliance between nine Democrats and 31 Republicans in the state Senate that creates a bipartisan majority is facing new scrutiny as its ranks grow.
Earlier this month, the rebel Democrats added a new member, Sen. Jose Peralta of Queens, from the 23-member mainline Democrats who are the Senate's minority conference.
While the rebel Democrats, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, have gradually expanded their ranks since forming in 2013, some New York City residents newly engaging with politics since the election of Republican President Donald Trump have taken greater notice of the conference this year. These New Yorkers are criticizing the breakaway Democrats for helping to empower Republicans in the 63-seat Senate even though Democrats outnumber Republicans by one seat in the state Senate.
"I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't paying a ton of attention," said Pamela Stark, a Queens resident in Mr. Peralta's district who is angry about the senator's move. "But after the presidential election, there's been a movement of people getting involved..and his switch may not change things big-picture, but it feels like a violation."
Mr. Peralta faced a group of angry residents at a town-hall meeting last week in which he tried to explain his move and ease some of their concerns. But some residents said the meeting didn't go well, and they are now circulating a petition urging Mr. Peralta to return to the mainline Democrats or resign.


Yale's Inconsistent Name-Dropping
Yale University announced Saturday that it would change the name of Calhoun College, one of its original 12 residential colleges that opened in the early 1930s. Henceforth, the college will be named in honor of Grace Hopper, an early computer scientist and naval officer.
No sentient observer of the American academic scene could have been surprised by the move to ditch John C. Calhoun, the 19th-century South Carolina statesman after whom the college was originally named. On the contrary, the unspoken response was "What took them so long?"
Since last August, when Yale's president, Peter Salovey, announced that he was convening a Committee to Establish Principles for Renaming—yes, really—the handwriting had been on the wall for Calhoun, a distinguished Yale alumnus who served as a congressman, senator, secretary of war, secretary of state and vice president.
Like Belshazzar before him, Calhoun had been weighed and found wanting. He may have been a brilliant orator and a fierce opponent of encroaching federal power, but he was also a slave holder. And unlike many of his peers, Calhoun argued that slavery was not merely a necessary evil but a "positive good," because it provided for slaves better than they could provide for themselves.
You might, like me, think that Calhoun was wrong about that. But if you are Peter Salovey, you have to disparage Calhoun as a "white supremacist" whose legacy—"racism and bigotry," according to a university statement—was fundamentally "at odds" with the noble aspirations of Yale University ("improving the world today and for future generations . . . through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community").


Andy Puzder's Grilling
President Trump's early troubles are starting to affect his ability to govern—to wit, Democrats think they have a shot at defeating his nominee for Labor Secretary, Andy Puzder. The White House had better get all hands on deck lest it lose a nominee who knows the damage that the Obama labor agenda did to workers.
Mr. Puzder has served as CEO of CKE Restaurants for the last 16 years, and labor groups are broadcasting complaints from workers at the company's Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains. Workers at CKE franchises represented by the union "Fight for $15" operation recently filed four charges of sexual harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 22 wage-and-hour complaints with state labor departments, and seven unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. The complaints represent fewer than 0.1% of CKE restaurants' workforce, and none were employed by corporate stores.
The Restaurant Opportunities Center United (ROC) last month also released an online survey that claimed to find rampant sexual harassment by customers and "wage theft" (i.e., workers not receiving required breaks or being paid overtime).
The ROC survey was far from scientific, and even the group's self-appointed spokesperson Keith Ellison—who's running to lead the Democratic National Committee—noted "we're not presenting ourselves as statisticians." Almost anyone could have completed the survey, and multiple times. One irony is that the NYC Health Department cited a ROC-owned restaurant in New York several times for unsanitary conditions. Its workers also sued for back pay.
More credible is a confidential phone survey of 250 CKE workers by the Employment Policies Institute. According to the survey, more than 90% of restaurant employees said they learned valuable job skills and felt safe and respected at work. The vast majority said managers accommodate their schedules outside of work, though about a quarter complained they couldn't work as many hours as they'd like.


Jakarta's Bellwether Election
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama is the front-runner and incumbent in Jakarta's gubernatorial race, having taken over when his predecessor, Joko Widodo, won election as Indonesia's President in 2014. The Governor is popular with the middle class because he fought corruption and improved the quality of government services.
But Mr. Purnama has two key weaknesses: He is Christian and ethnically Chinese. That has allowed an alliance of Islamists and nationalists to organize a hate campaign against him.
The real target is Mr. Widodo's efforts to clean up Indonesia's patronage politics and protect its secular traditions. If Mr. Purnama wins a majority in the first round of voting on Wednesday, he will further the reform movement in the capital and protect the President's flank. If the election goes to a second round on April 19 and one of the challengers wins, the new Governor could challenge Mr. Widodo for the Presidency in 2019.
Mr. Purnama's enemies doctored a video from last September to make it appear he criticized the Quran. That led to a criminal blasphemy case that is still proceeding and could see him imprisoned for five years. Radical groups such as the Islamic Defender's Front organized mass protests to demand the election of a pious Muslim.
Also alarming are the social-media attacks on Mr. Purnama's Chinese ancestry. These capitalize on resentment of the Chinese-Indonesian community's prominence in the economy. Like political Islam, race-based political forces can threaten Indonesia's multiethnic democracy. In 1965 mobs slaughtered thousands of Chinese-Indonesians and killed smaller numbers in 1998.


Chicago Sees Three Fatal Shootings of Children in Recent Days
CHICAGO—Police said Wednesday they had made one arrest in the separate fatal shootings of three children below the age of 13 over the past several days, renewing calls from police for legislation that would mandate tougher sentences for repeat gun offenders.
On Tuesday, a 2-year-old boy was fatally shot after someone fired multiple shots inside a vehicle where he was sitting with his aunt and her male partner. Police said the man in the car, who is in his 20s and a documented gang member, was also fatally shot.
This past weekend, two girls, 11 and 12, were shot in two separate incidents in two Chicago neighborhoods. Police say that both were hit by stray bullets. Takiya Holmes, the 11-year-old, was shot in the back of her head while sitting in a parked car and succumbed to her gunshot wounds Tuesday.
"It has been pretty tough on her mother," said Andrew Holmes, Ms. Holmes's cousin and a community activist. "You give these babies birth and all of a sudden, they are taking their last breath in front of you."
The 12-year-old victim, Kanari Gentry Bowers, was playing basketball at her elementary school when she was shot in the head, community leaders and the school's principal said. After days on life support, she died Wednesday afternoon, according to a statement from Stroger Hospital where she was being treated.


In Marshall, Va., Support for Donald Trump Hasn't Wavered
MARSHALL, Va.—James Cookson hadn't voted for a president since 1976, when he backed Democrat Jimmy Carter. But last year, Donald Trump drew him back to the polls with a promise to reduce business regulations.
Now, Mr. Cookson is watching Mr. Trump's tumultuous first month in office with hope and a bit of hesitancy, but mostly with continued support. Mr. Cookson, who installs satellite TV hookups, said he hopes the new president settles into his job quickly so he can follow through on his campaign promises.
"He's trying to make good on his promises, but he's learning that running a country and running a business are two different things. And I'm hoping he's a quick study," Mr. Cookson said recently over breakfast at the Old Salem Cafe in this exurban community about an hour's drive from Washington, D.C.
Elsewhere, voters angry at Mr. Trump have been flooding into town-hall meetings to tell Republican lawmakers to back away from the new president and to fight his agenda. But support for Mr. Trump remains strong in Marshall, a community of farms and big housing lots in a county that backed Mr. Trump last November by 25 percentage points.
The support here is one signal that Mr. Trump, while stirring hostile opposition in parts of the country, appears to be holding his political base.


Bill Gates Urges Sharper Military Focus on Bioterror
MUNICH—Bill Gates wants the U.S. military to focus more training on preparing to fight a global pandemic or bioterror attack.
The Microsoft Corp. founder, who leads a foundation focused on global health, said a global pandemic—from natural causes or an engineered virus—could be more dangerous than a nuclear bomb or climate change.
Security officials are serious about making sure nuclear material, which could be used to kill a few million people, is secured, Mr. Gates said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference. A terrorist engineered virus, he said, would be worse.
"These are the things that could kill hundreds of millions—they are probably the only thing that can kill a billion," he said.
Mr. Gates said advances in efforts to monitor disease outbreaks and innovations in technology should allow new vaccines to be developed and mass produced more quickly. But not enough is invested into the kinds of tools that would be needed to prepare for, detect, monitor and respond to a bio-outbreak, he said.


Notable & Quotable: Trust in Media
Hugh HewittinterviewingJohn Dickerson, host of CBS 's "Face the Nation," on Mr. Hewitt's radio show Feb. 17:
Hewitt: [President Trump] made some incredible misstatements yesterday. . . . But that one comment, they don't trust you anymore, is a summation of where we are in America, because I really do think Manhattan-Beltway elites have lost the country. They've lost it. There's just no confidence in, I'm not going to say us, because I am neither in nor of the Beltway-Manhattan media elite. I live in California still. But what do you think of that? Is it true?
Dickerson: Well, yes. I mean, yes, it's true, and it's not because of anything obviously Donald Trump did. The press did all that good work ruining its reputation on its own, and we can have a long conversation about what created that. Part of it, though, is . . . a lot of hysterical coverage about every little last thing that doesn't warrant it. Having said that, it doesn't mean, and in fact, it most explicitly does not mean that the press just throws out the standards.


New Chief Promises Reforms at Beleaguered ACS
Mayor Bill de Blasio Tuesday announced the appointment of David Hansell to head the city's Administration for Children's Services, which has come under fire for its handling of child-abuse cases.
Mr. Hansell promised a thorough review of ACS operations, continued reforms at the administration, and a new emphasis on using data to measure program effectiveness.
Mr. Hansell, 63 years old, steps into a position left open by the resignation of Gladys Carrión, announced in December after the administration came under fire for its handling of child abuse cases.
When she stepped down, Ms. Carrión said she "struggled with this decision but have come to the conclusion that it is best for my well-being." The mayor said at the time she had brought a "heightened level of accountability" to the agency.
Those abuse cases included the November death of 3-year-old Jalen Jordan, who died after an alleged beating by his mother's boyfriend. ACS officials received a complaint about Jaden's care days before the incident but never located the boy, city officials have said.


Trump vs. Trump
Donald Trump is right that the media is making a mountain out of every Trump molehill. Despite the "resistance," it also remains true that most Americans want the Trump presidency to succeed.
These Trump Hopefuls, whose number includes people who didn't vote for him, want the presidency to succeed because they understand that if it fails, the social and economic condition of their country will be in a bad place.
Despite this reservoir of goodwill for the Trump presidency, the degree of anxiety about it is palpable. You have to be living in Netflixed isolation not to have had conversations with people wondering what the hell is going on at this White House.
Beyond the Beltway bubble, I think most people look upon the pitched battle between Mr. Trump and the news media as they would a playground fight between sixth-graders.
"He hit me first."


Trump's Hard Line on Immigration Collides With U.S. Demographics
President Donald Trumphopes to deliver growth above 3% in the coming decade, which would be hard in the best of times. He and some of his fellow Republicans seem intent on making it even harder by putting the brakes on immigration.
It is a basic rule of economics that a nation's output depends on the number of people it employs and how productively they work. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office and most private economists think output will grow a mere 2% per year in the next decade. To beat the consensus, Mr. Trump and Republicans need to find ways to get the labor force or productivity to grow much more quickly.
That could mean getting millions of Americans who have quit the labor force to return. But it's a tall order because the population is aging. That leaves immigration. Yet Mr. Trump campaigned on limiting legal and illegal immigrants, citing the need to protect jobs and public safety. His administration has already expanded deportation of illegal immigrants. Two weeks ago Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republican senators for Arkansas and Georgia, respectively, introduced a bill that would cut annual legal immigration in half, to 539,958 by the 10th year.
Current legal and illegal immigration, net of emigrants (those who leave), is now around 1 million per year, or just 0.3% of the existing population, below the 0.4% average since 1790, according to an exhaustive study last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
That relatively modest number looms especially large in the future of the U.S. for one simple reason. Because of falling fertility rates, the natural rate of U.S. population growth (births minus deaths) has fallen to 0.4%, its lowest since the founding of the republic. On current trends, it will only get closer to zero, which means immigration will account for all the growth in the labor force.


Draining the Regulatory Swamp
Nancy Pelosi says Republicans have accomplished nothing in 2017, and no doubt she wishes that were true. But the House has already voted to repeal 13 Obama-era regulations, and President Trump signed his third on Tuesday. Now the GOP should accelerate by fully utilizing the 1996 Congressional Review Act.
Republicans chose the damaging 13 rules based on a conventional reading of the CRA, which allows Congress to override regulations published within 60 legislative days, with simple (50-vote) majorities in both chambers. Yet the more scholars examine the law, which had only been used successfully once before this year, the clearer it is that the CRA gives Congress far more regulatory oversight than previously supposed.
Spearheading this review is the Pacific Legal Foundation's Todd Gaziano—who helped write the 1996 act—and the Heritage Foundation's Paul Larkin. Their legal findings, and a growing list of rules that might be subject to CRA, are on www.redtaperollback.com.
The pair argue, first, that the CRA defines "rule" broadly. The law relies on the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act, which includes any "agency statement" that is "designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy." This includes major and minor rules as well as "guidance"—letters that spell out an agency's interpretation of a law.
This matters because President Obama's regulators often ducked the notice and comment of formal rule-making by issuing "guidance" to act as de facto regulation. Examples include the guidance requiring transgender bathrooms in public schools, which the Trump Administration recently withdrew, or the 2011 guidance dictating how universities must handle sexual assault. The latter is ripe for CRA repeal.


Notable & Quotable: Moral Outrage
Elizabeth Nolan Brown, writing on Reason.com's "Hit & Run" blog, March 1:
When people publicly rage about perceived injustices that don't affect them personally, we tend to assume this expression is rooted in altruism—a "disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others." But new research suggests that professing such third-party concern—what social scientists refer to as "moral outrage"—is often a function of self-interest, wielded to assuage feelings of personal culpability for societal harms or reinforce (to the self and others) one's own status as a Very Good Person.
Outrage expressed "on behalf of the victim of [a perceived] moral violation" is often thought of as "a prosocial emotion" rooted in "a desire to restore justice by fighting on behalf of the victimized," explain Bowdoin psychology professor Zachary Rothschild and University of Southern Mississippi psychology professor Lucas A. Keefer in the latest edition of Motivation and Emotion. Yet this conventional construction—moral outrage as the purview of the especially righteous—is "called into question" by research on guilt, they say.


Erdogan Withdraws From the West
Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Turkey out of the West.
The Islamist strongman has been telegraphing this since at least 2008. That was when he launched the great purge of the country's secular establishment, and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) began showing signs that its faith in "Muslim democracy" is less than sincere. For nearly a decade, the West didn't hear, or pretended not to. Now there's no mistaking the message.
Turkish authorities last week charged Deniz Yücel, a reporter with the German newspaper Die Welt, with "spreading propaganda of a terrorist organization and for inciting the public to hatred." Mr. Yücel's "crime" was interviewing a commander of the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party and reporting on alleged email hacking of Mr. Erdogan's son-in-law.
The trumped-up indictment is typical of the ugly and paranoid Turkey Mr. Erdogan has been building. Since an attempted coup in the summer, the government has detained thousands of Turks, fired tens of thousands from their jobs and shuttered more than 120 media outlets. Yet Ankara's brazenness in the case of Mr. Yücel—a Turkish-German dual citizen—marks a milestone in Turkey's departure from the Western family of nations.
Once you start acting like Iran or China, there's no easy way back.


Pentagon Tries to Rein In Nude-Photo Fallout
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon on Friday sought to contain damage from an expanding controversy over allegations that active members of the military have shared nude photos of female Marines, as the investigation expanded to all military branches.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the actions "unacceptable," while Gen. Robert Neller, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, said he is putting together a special task force to examine the allegations. A Pentagon spokesman said all branches of the military are trying to determine how widespread the problem might be.
But the Pentagon's actions have failed to stop people from sharing graphic images of female service members: Photos removed from a controversial Facebook page began popping up on other Internet sites, including one based outside the U.S. that could be difficult to shut down, according to U.S. officials and military veterans.
"Lack of respect for the dignity and humanity of fellow members of the Department of Defense is unacceptable and counter to unit cohesion," Mr. Mattis said. "We will not excuse or tolerate such behavior if we are to uphold our values and maintain our ability to defeat the enemy on the battlefield."
While some veterans praised Pentagon leadership for taking steps to address the problem, they questioned their commitment to fixing a problem that has plagued the military for years.


BJP Victory Boosts India's Modi
NEW DELHI—Prime Minister Narendra Modi is riding into the second half of his term with more political capital to expand his anticorruption crackdown and promote economic development after his party's resounding electoral victory in India's most-populous state.
Although his political opponents will still be able to block contentious legislation in Parliament, this weekend's wins will give Mr. Modi greater freedom to use executive action to advance his agenda ahead of a likely re-election bid in 2019.
"These elections will start a bigger movement for development," Mr. Modi said in a speech to his party's workers on Sunday. "We will take this new India to great heights."
Mr. Modi crushed his rivals in Uttar Pradesh, which is home to one in six Indians. His Bharatiya Janata Party won more than three-quarters of the seats in the state's legislature in results declared Saturday. It also won an election in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, but was defeated in the agrarian state of Punjab.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in a televised interview that the outcome in Uttar Pradesh delivered a strong message to the government: "Go ahead without the fear of consequences and people will support you in the national interest."


Coca Cultivation Soars in Colombia
EL TARRA, Colombia—The coca leaf used to make cocaine has made such a dramatic comeback in this country that plantings now cover more territory than they did before a multibillion-dollar U.S.-sponsored eradication campaign began 16 years ago, U.S. and Colombian officials said.
The surge in the coca crop has come since 2013, as the U.S. was forced to reduce and ultimately end spraying from crop dusters because of health concerns over the use of a toxic defoliant and the Colombian government's worries that the program was turning many rural residents against the state as it was negotiating a peace deal with Marxist rebels. On Tuesday, U.S. officials in Washington are expected to announce that coca is planted on about 695 square miles of land, or more than 10 times the area of the District of Columbia. The increase continues a rise in which planted acreage has more than doubled since its lowest point in 2012.
The new figures, based on U.S. satellite imagery, show that farmers in towns such as El Tarra have been cultivating more coca, antinarcotics officials in both countries told The Wall Street Journal in recent interviews.
"They have been planting like crazy," said William Brownfield, director of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the State Department agency overseeing U.S. drug policy.
The trendline is disheartening for U.S. antidrug officials, who for years worked with their Colombian counterparts to attack what were once industrial-size fields of coca. Under the U.S.'s Plan Colombia aid program, more than $10 billion spent on crop dusters, attack helicopters and training for Colombian antidrug forces helped reduce the size of the crop to 301 square miles in 2012 from 656 square miles in 2001, cutting into drug organizations' operations.


How Democrats Can Come Back
President Trump's chaotic beginning has many Democrats envisioning a big comeback. They see the marches and protests and presidential tweets and expect newly energized Americans to vote blue in droves. But these hopes mask the decrepit state of the Democratic Party at all levels of government. A true Democratic comeback will be impossible without top-to-bottom changes.
The GOP is in one of its strongest positions since its founding in 1854. Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. But much of governing in America is done at the state and local levels, where education, infrastructure, voting and gun rights are primarily determined. There the GOP is even more dominant. Republicans have 33 governorships and more than two-thirds of state legislative chambers.
That the Democrats have allowed this domination borders on gross negligence. Complacency was so deep, for example, that most Democrats in Washington apparently either didn't know or didn't care about the gerrymandering strategy Republicans perpetrated over the past eight years to gain long-term control of the House and key swing-state legislatures. That's why hearing some senior Democratic leaders dismiss recent losses as a "messaging problem" is disturbing. If the Democratic Party were a publicly held company, the management and the board already would have been dismissed.
The Democratic Party needs a housecleaning. It will never get out of deep minority status without it. In that spirit, here are four reforms that would help get the party back on its feet.
First, the party needs new leadership. Younger, more diverse voices are needed at the congressional and state levels. The giant Republican gains largely occurred under the noses of most of the current party leadership. It's time for new faces.


White House Back-Pedals on Claim Obama Wiretapped Trump's Phones
White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday backpedaled on President Donald Trump's claims that his phone line was ordered tapped by then-President Barack Obama, an allegation that Mr. Trump recently made on Twitter without providing any evidence.
In an animated question-and-answer session with reporters during his regular briefing, Mr. Spicer suggested Mr. Trump had been speaking broadly when he posted his accusations against Mr. Obama on March 4.
"He doesn't really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally," Mr. Spicer said. "But I think there's no question that the Obama administration—that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely reported activity that occurred back then. The president used the word 'wiretapped' in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities."
Mr. Spicer continued, "It is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle and are now wondering where the proof is."
A spokesman for Mr. Obama has denied the allegation of wiretapping.


Arrests at Ferguson Protest Fueled by Documentary's Claims
Three people were arrested in Ferguson, Mo., during a small protest that broke out after a documentary offered new details about the hours before a local police officer killed Michael Brown in 2014, police said in a statement Monday.
Of those arrested Sunday night, one punched a police officer who suffered a broken nose, and another tried to ignite a police car, said Ferguson police Chief Delrish Moss. Protesters also fired several shots at the end of the protest, police said.
Sparking the unrest was the documentary "Stranger Fruit," which premiered at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. The film added a new angle into Mr. Brown's shooting, the events surrounding which have long been debated by officers, his family and community activists.
The documentary, using never-before-released footage from the night before his killing, suggests that Mr. Brown wasn't robbing the Ferguson Market & Liquor before being killed by Darren Wilson, a white officer. The documentary claims that Mr. Brown had traded marijuana for cigarillos and had returned only to collect them.
Police have said that Officer Wilson wasn't aware of the alleged robbery when he stopped Mr. Brown.


Brazil Top Prosecutor Requests More Probes
BRASÍLIA—Brazil's attorney general said Tuesday in a public announcement that it has asked the country's Supreme Court for permission to start investigations of scores of politicians as part of the blockbuster Operation Car Wash anticorruption probe.
The requests are under seal, so the names on the list weren't immediately revealed. Attorney General Rodrigo Janot has asked the Supreme Court to make the names public, his office said in the announcement.
Mr. Janot sent a total of 83 investigation requests, according to his office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Janot couldn't say how many individuals the requests included.
Brazil's leading media outlets have reported that at least five members of President Michel Temer's cabinet are among those who may be on the investigators' list, as well as prominent current and former officials. The reports couldn't be independently confirmed.
A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said it could take days before further details are officially released.


Lawsuit From 2015 Brazilian Mining Disaster Suspended
RIO DE JANEIRO—A Brazilian judge suspended a nearly $50 billion lawsuit against mining firms responsible for the 2015 Samarco disaster Thursday, as negotiations between the companies and authorities moved forward.
The decision came as part of a ruling in which federal judge Mário de Paula Franco Júnior approved a road map toward a final agreement between prosecutors and mining companies Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and their joint-venture Samarco Mineração SA.
Federal prosecutors, regulatory agencies and the three companies have been locked in fierce litigation since Samarco's Fundão tailings dam collapsed on Nov. 5, 2015, releasing an avalanche of mine waste. The incident is widely considered Brazil's worst-ever environmental catastrophe and the largest failure of a mining dam.
Due to its scale—the disaster killed 19 people, wiped out villages below the dam and polluted hundreds of miles of rivers—authorities have struggled to come up with a definitive tally of the damage.
To that end, the partial agreement ratified Thursday called for three different groups of experts—two appointed by the court, one by the companies—to come up with studies that would assess the social, economic and environmental impacts of the disaster and evaluate the recovery programs under way.


Report Says Jailed Undocumented Immigrants Released Despite DHS Requests
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration sought to ramp up pressure on so-called sanctuary cities on Monday, detailing cases where local police released undocumented immigrants who federal authorities had asked them to detain.
The new report by the Department of Homeland Security says that during one week this year, it learned of 206 people released from local jails despite "detainer" requests. In these cases, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency asks local police to hold illegal immigrants for up to 48 hours, long enough for ICE officers to pick them up and put them into deportation proceedings.
The report comes at a time when many cities have reaffirmed or declared themselves "sanctuaries" and refused to hold people in jail once they are otherwise free to go. The administration has already threatened to pull federal grant money from cities that don't cooperate; now it is trying a sort of public shaming.
"This important report demonstrates a clear and ongoing threat to public safety," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. "It is not acceptable for jurisdictions to refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement by releasing criminal aliens back into our communities when our law required them to be deported."
The report lists the names of 118 law-enforcement agencies that limit cooperation, including many large cities such as New York, Washington, Chicago and Philadelphia. It also lists the cases of people released, including information about crimes for which they were charged or convicted.


South Korea Prosecutors Question Former President Park Geun-hye
SEOUL—South Korean prosecutors grilled former President Park Geun-hye​ for more than 20 hours on Tuesday—her first questioning after returning to private life nearly a week ago—amid expectations that she herself could become the latest suspect in a corruption scandal that already ended her presidency and put the Samsung conglomerate's de facto leader behind bars.
Ms. Park, who ruled South Korea for more than four years, apologized to the public before entering the offices of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors, saying she would take part "sincerely" in the investigation.
During the marathon interrogation, Ms. Park's lawyer said the impeached leader was served for lunch sandwiches, fried tofu rice balls and kimbap—a seaweed rice roll that costs about $2.50 and looks like sushi without the fish. For dinner, she was given porridge.
She left the prosecutors' office to return home just before 7 a.m. on Wednesday morning and didn't make any public statement after leaving.
The speedy summoning of Ms. Park, which came less than two weeks after she was stripped of her presidential immunity from criminal charges, suggests that the Seoul prosecutors' investigation isn't likely to abate, even after Ms. Park's removal from office and the termination of a mandate for an independent prosecutor tasked with spearheading the probe.


Gorsuch's Foes Embarrass the Senate
During last week's confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch, some of my Senate colleagues heard from teachers who were using the occasion as an educational tool. Indeed, Supreme Court confirmation hearings can be a civics lesson for the nation. They offer unparalleled insight into the Constitution and the proper role of judges in our system of government.
I have participated in 14 of these hearings during my four decades on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The nominees are typically highly talented lawyers and judges. The Senate's role is to probe their qualifications and judicial philosophies. At its best, the process is removed from the pettiness of partisan politics.
I take this duty seriously. Although I am a committed conservative, I have voted for the Supreme Court nominees of both parties—even those I might not have chosen myself—as long as I have been assured of their fitness for office. I helped shepherd through President Clinton's nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Both had shown themselves to be honorable, capable jurists with reputations for careful, nonideological work on federal appeals courts.
What sort of civics lesson were the American people treated to last week? Judge Gorsuch's performance was outstanding. Enduring more than 20 hours of questioning over two days, he displayed an impressive command of the law and an intellect befitting someone with his stellar credentials. He showed that he understands the proper role of a judge in our system: to apply, not make, the law. Throughout, his demeanor was serious, thoughtful and humble. These qualities have defined his judicial service for the past decade and will serve him well on the Supreme Court.
In stark contrast was the astonishing treatment Judge Gorsuch received from many of my Democratic colleagues. Whatever their motivation—be it the outcome of President Obama's lame-duck nomination during last year's election, an unwillingness to accept the November results, or the desire for judges to push a liberal political agenda—they have apparently decided to wage a desperate, scorched-earth campaign to derail this nomination, no matter the damage they inflict along the way. We are now watching the confirmation process through the funhouse mirror.


The Word 'Fraught' Carries a Heavy Burden
Over the past decade, "fraught" has become the go-to adjective for journalists who look at the dark side of things. In one week last month I saw it almost a dozen times in newspapers and magazines.
A Washington Post commentator notes that President Trump is "consistently under fire for his fraught relationship with the black community," and a Post headline says: "The Grammys Face Fallout After Fraught Awards." A New York Times writer claims that "recent decades have brought big, fraught, much-discussed changes to Brooklyn," and a Times headline says that "enemy of the people"—Mr. Trump's description of the press—is "a phrase with a fraught history."
So many nouns these days are modified by fraught. Bob Dylan wrote a song with the refrain, "Everything is broken." Maybe there should be a song with the refrain, "Everything is fraught."
We know what broken means, but fraught is less easy to pin down. The Oxford English Dictionary's second definition is "caused or affected by anxiety or stress." Google's second definition is the same except that it speaks of "great anxiety," making it even more of a downer.
Oxford's first definition looks back to an older meaning of the word, when it was usually followed by "with": "Fraught with (of a situation or course of action)" means "filled with (something undesirable)." Google's first definition is similar. Both definitions imply that what follows is something undesirable: difficulty, risk, danger, pain, embarrassment.


U.S. Boosts Military Backing for Saudi-Led Coalition in Yemen
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has significantly increased military support for Sunni Arab states fighting al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias in Yemen, said U.S. and Arab officials, drawing the U.S. deeper into the two-year civil war there.
American support now includes greater intelligence and logistical support for the militaries of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, these officials said.
The Trump administration also is moving to resume the sale of precision-guided weapons to Saudi Arabia, which were frozen during the final months of the Obama administration due to concerns about the rising numbers of civilian fatalities in Yemen.
"We have a commitment..that they will increase this cooperation," said Saudi Gen. Ahmad al-Asiri, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, who visited Washington this month with Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. "If there was a hiccup last year, this was an abnormality."
The U.S. is predominantly interested in providing support for Gulf nations to fight al Qaeda militants inside Yemen, who are seen as posing a direct threat to the American homeland, according to U.S. officials.


Parents' Spring Dilemma: To Test or Not To Test
Parents are grappling again with questions about whether to have their children participate in state tests starting this week in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The last two years saw a surge of students skipping the federally mandated tests. In New York, which had the most opting out, 21% of children in grades three to eight boycotted last spring. It is unclear how strong the movement will be this season.
Jeanne Garbarino, who has a fourth-grader at P.S. 81 in the Bronx, doesn't see much value in the annual reading and math assessments but wants her daughter to take them as practice for a lifetime of testing ahead. She said her daughter has been anxious even though she aced the tests last year.
"The nonstop discussion at school, every day, all day, is the test, especially in the last two weeks," Ms. Garbarino said. "She finds it really frustrating."
Many parents say the consuming nature of the annual regimen is one reason for balking. Jeanette Deutermann, an opt-out advocate with two boys in Bellmore, N.Y., said teaching to the test "hijacks" the classroom all year and opting out is a way parents can show their objections. "This is making sure the state education department, legislators, and everyone involved knows that parents are not happy with the system," she said.


Opioids Shouldn't Be a Doctor's First Resort
Percocet, my patient announced, was the best antidepressant she'd ever had. An orthopedist had prescribed her the drug for back pain resulting from a fall. When the patient, who suffered from depression, asked for more, I refused, explaining the opioid's high addictive potential. Still, I worried that if I didn't give her a prescription, another doctor would.
Close to 50% of the opioids prescribed in this country are given out by primary-care doctors like me. Our pain training is minimal, yet patients frequently ask us to help them manage or overcome it. Too many of us jump too quickly to Percocet, Vicodin and codeine, drugs that merely mask symptoms instead of treating underlying causes.
Frequently patients suffer from little more than muscle spasms, which, while painful, might be better treated with heat, physical therapy, muscle relaxants or Advil. Sometimes even proper posture or weight loss will do the trick. These are do-no-harm options. But doctors may be too rushed or self-serving to consider them.
Patients deserve some of the blame. Typically, they wait until an appointment is almost over before mentioning pain. Savvy physicians should anticipate this. We also need to be better at diagnosing underlying problems correctly and having a list of initial treatments (not including opioids) at the ready.
Some 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, according to the Institute of Medicine. Doctors use this estimate to justify a quick opioid prescription. But 4 out of 5 heroin abusers started with prescription painkillers. Only 27% of those taking opioids are using their own prescriptions.


Malaysia Sentences Islamic State-Linked Nightclub Attackers
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysia sentenced two men to 25 years in prison for a hand-grenade attack on a nightclub last year, the first terror attack connected to Islamic State in the country.
Imam Wahyudin Karjono, 21 years old, and Jonius Indie, 24, pleaded guilty to charges of supporting terrorist activities Wednesday and received the sentences, state news agency Bernama reported. They also pleaded guilty to giving support to Islamic State and received additional 10-year prison terms to run concurrently.
Judicial Commissioner Nordin Hassan said the sentence was intended to "give a signal to those outside..and your comrades who want to continue the struggle [of supporting violence] which they feel is correct," Bernama reported.
The men were the first to be convicted for the nightclub attack, which injured eight people. Police have arrested at least 17 suspects, including two believed to be involved in the planning of the attack and 13 alleged to have belonged to the same terror cell as the pair convicted.
The attack occurred in the early hours of June 28 as patrons watched Euro 2016 soccer matches at a nightclub outside of Kuala Lumpur.


The House Un-Freedom Caucus
On the night of Nov. 8, 2016, after it was clear that Donald Trump had upset Hillary Clinton, there was broad agreement that one word described the American electorate's purpose: change. Voters wanted change from the status quo.
Last week, not 100 days into the Trump presidency, the members of the House Freedom Caucus decided that the 2016 election was not about change. It was instead about legislative gridlock, with the bitterly ironic difference that these 25 or so self-described conservatives have locked up their own party.
Democrats need 24 pickups to regain control of the House. There are 23 Republicans running from districts Mrs. Clinton won. After the 2018 midterms, history may record that the Republican Party lost House control to the Democrats around 2 p.m. on Thursday, March 23, 2017.
That was when Republican members from closely contested congressional districts—such as Virginia's Barbara Comstock and New York's John Faso—announced they would vote against the health-care reform bill.
The Freedom Caucus, whose leaders are from "safe" districts, opened a Pandora's box that pushed these Republicans into impossible vulnerability on the health-care bill. Now Democrats will exploit this vulnerability on every issue before the House.


Mike Flynn Didn't Disclose Russian-Linked Payments in Initial Document
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump's embattled former national security adviser Mike Flynn initially didn't disclose payments he received from three Russian-linked entities on a financial disclosure form he filed upon entering government.
As part of the routine public release of the financial disclosure reports from top officials, the White House provided two versions of Mr. Flynn's 2016 financial disclosure form over the weekend—an initial version he filed in February and a more complete version he submitted last week.
On the earlier version of the form, Mr. Flynn didn't provide a full list of organizations and companies that had paid him for speaking engagements, including three Russia-linked organizations. Those payments became a source of controversy for the former national security adviser and retired three-star Army general who was forced to resign from the Trump administration earlier this year.
On a second, amended form filed on March 31, Mr. Flynn acknowledged that he had received fees from RT, the television network and media outlet funded by the Russian government; as well as Volga-Dnepr Group, a Russian air-cargo company; and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, a U.S. subsidiary of a leading Russian cybersecurity firm. Those three speaking engagements had been previously reported.
Mr. Flynn was forced out of his White House position earlier this year after it was revealed that he misled top officials about the nature of his communications with representatives of the Russian government. He has since been in discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees about testimony in exchange for possible immunity.


Obama WMD Intelligence Failure
When the Bush Administration failed to find the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein was thought to have, opponents used the intelligence failure to discredit the war in Iraq and call George W. Bush a liar. Will there be any even remotely similar accounting after the Obama Administration's intelligence failure in Syria, where Bashar Assad has used chemical weapons we were told he didn't have?
On Tuesday at least 85 civilians, including children, were killed by a gas attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. The World Health Organization says the attack likely involved banned nerve agents, with other medical experts pointing to sarin as the culprit.
Why is this an intelligence failure? Because the Obama Administration assured the world that it had forced Mr. Assad to give up all chemical weapons. In an interview with National Public Radio on January 16, Susan Rice, then the White House national security adviser, was unequivocal:
"I think the President [Obama] stated the U.S. view, which is the use of chemical weapons is not something we're prepared to allow to persist, and we didn't. We managed to accomplish that goal far more thoroughly than we could have by some limited strikes against chemical targets by getting the entirety of the declared stockpile removed." The residents of Khan Sheikhoun beg to differ.
Ms. Rice's assurances were part of the Obama Administration's foreign-policy victory lap as it ended its time in office. But did she or others know at the time that Mr. Assad still had stockpiles of sarin gas? Were there dissenting intelligence reports raising doubts about the Assad-Russian pledges that the regime had turned everything over to United Nations monitors?


Donald Trump Tells Aides to Stop Fighting and Promote the Agenda
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump has told his senior advisers to prioritize his agenda over infighting as the White House focuses on what accomplishments it can tout during the president's first 100 days in office, administration officials said.
Less than three weeks before the April 29 milestone—a largely media-driven moment that all modern administrations face—Mr. Trump is seeking to project himself less as a disruptive force in the capital and more as a leader who can minimize the tumult in the West Wing and work constructively with the powers-that-be in Washington, the officials said.
After weighing a staff shake-up last week, he told chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, to find a way to work together, aides said. The two men have agreed to put aside their differences to try to implement the president's agenda, a senior administration official said.
"That's the plan," the official said, while cautioning that it is unclear whether the detente will hold.
Aides said the 100-day mark is taking on significant importance for the president, who has already referenced upcoming cable television specials in conversations with aides.


Sessions Urges Police to Cooperate With Immigration Enforcement
Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged cities and police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities on Tuesday, highlighting the divide between the Trump administration and some police chiefs over the role of local agencies in immigration enforcement.
"Some mayors and city councils, and even a police chief and a sheriff here and there, are refusing to work with the federal government, choosing instead to protect the criminal aliens who harm public safety. Today, I urge them to work with us," Mr. Sessions said in a speech before a gathering of police chiefs in Arizona, according to the text of his prepared remarks.
Last month, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal criminal-justice grants from cities that thwart cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, but it hasn't yet publicly revoked grants over such concerns.
Police chiefs in some major cities have balked at requests to aid federal officials in enforcing immigration law, saying to do so would make it difficult for illegal immigrants in their cities to report crimes as witnesses or victims.
Last week, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo reported a drop in Latinos reporting violent crimes to the police.


Tillerson Says U.S.-Russia Relations at 'Low Point' After Meeting With Putin
MOSCOW—The U.S. and Russia tried Wednesday to reduce rapidly rising tensions, but clashed over a range of issues, especially the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, during a daylong visit by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that included the Trump administration's first face-to-face talk with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Mr. Tillerson and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, engaged in a lengthy, detailed and often blunt exchange of views at a Moscow news conference that veered across an array of thorny foreign policy questions and reinforced how deeply at odds the two governments stand at the start of the Trump administration.
The presidents of both countries personally waded into the day's diplomatic efforts in an apparent bid to move past some of the divisions, with Mr. Putin meeting with Mr. Tillerson for about two hours. President Donald Trump at a news conference later spoke less-than-optimistically about whether the efforts would bear fruit.
"We may be at an all-time low" in relations, Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House following a visit by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's secretary-general. "We'll see what happens."
For the first high-level U.S. visit to Russia, it was a halting start in the relationship. After hours of meetings between Mr. Tillerson and Russia's leaders, for instance, Mr. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, criticized what he described as a Western "fixation" on removing dictators and authoritarian leaders.


Trump's Promise to Veterans
Donald Trump pitched himself as a friend to the American military, and to veterans in particular. His campaign pledged to fix the Department of Veterans Affairs "by firing the corrupt and incompetent VA executives who let our veterans down." Since taking office, however, President Trump hasn't defined what, if anything, his administration will do to make good on that promise. Here are a couple of obvious wrongs he can easily make right.
In 2015, a pair of senior VA officials were accused of defrauding the department to the tune of $400,000. Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves, the directors of two regional VA offices, had allegedly manipulated the department's hiring and transfer systems for personal financial gain. Ms. Rubens was accused of pressuring a subordinate to leave the VA's Philadelphia office so she could take the job herself, move from Washington, and collect a $288,000 relocation payout. Similarly, Ms. Graves received more than $129,000 by engineering a move from Philadelphia to St. Paul, Minn.
Allison Hickey resigned in October 2015 as the VA undersecretary for benefits amid investigations into her role in the scheme. Ms. Rubens and Ms. Graves were called to appear before the House Veterans Affairs Committee that November, but they refused to testify, invoking their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Instead of being fired, the pair were demoted. Due to a VA "paperwork mistake," however, the demotion had to be rescinded in December 2015 and reissued.
Then the two got a reprieve from the Merit Systems Protection Board, the quasijudicial agency whose mission, in part, is to review the disciplining of federal employees. The MSPB is the successor of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, originally set up to protect federal workers from partisan recrimination.
In early 2016 the MSPB fully reversed the punishments of Ms. Rubens and Ms. Graves. Furthermore, the VA did not to try to recover the taxpayer funds that the pair had collected for relocating. It seems that since "senior officials" approved the $400,000, it would have been somehow improper to ask for the money back.


At Least 13 Arrested in Berkeley as Trump Detractors, Supporters Clash
BERKELEY, Calif.—At least 13 people were arrested after violence broke out Saturday between groups of supporters and detractors of President Donald Trump holding rallies in downtown Berkeley, authorities said.
About 200 people were at Berkeley's Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park when several fights broke out. Dozens of police officers in riot gear standing nearby quickly arrested one man. Others were arrested after several skirmishes.
Trump supporters had announced earlier in the week that they would hold a "Patriot Day" at the park at noon featuring speeches by members of the alt-right. Counter-demonstrators then said they would hold a rally at the same place at 10 a.m.
Police created a barrier of plastic orange poles and orange fence mesh to separate the sides, but that quickly came down as demonstrators started punching and kicking each other, while pepper spray and firecrackers were thrown into the crowd.
The groups then left the park and walked on Berkeley streets with police closely following them. Photographs of the scene showed at least two men with bloodied faces.


Hungry Venezuelans Demand Change
Images of protesters in Caracas running through clouds of tear gas and bloodied by state security forces have been front and center in recent media coverage of Venezuela. Other cities around the country also have been hit hard by police, national guard troops and the regime's paramilitary forces as the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro tries to contain a wildfire of rebellion.
Since 1999, when Hugo Chávez launched his Bolivarian revolution, sporadic periods of social unrest have been quashed with force. But this time things are different. The government is running out of money to buy imports, and since it has crippled domestic production, privation is growing more profound.
These protests were initially sparked by the Supreme Court's attempt to shut down the opposition-controlled National Assembly. They have flourished because of hunger. Venezuela remains a long way from a return to the modern liberal democracy that its 1961 constitution envisioned. But the status quo is unsustainable.
So far this month pro-government militias or the police have allegedly killed three protesters in and around Barquisimeto, the capital city of Lara state. A demonstrator was fatally shot in Valencia—the third largest city in the country—and the governor of Carabobo state has admitted that the police were responsible. Another young protester was killed in a satellite city of Caracas, and an 87-year-old Caracas woman died when tear gas inundated her home.
Roving bands of government-sponsored militias terrorize civil society as they have for more than a decade. On Wednesday one gang burst into the Basilica of St. Teresa in Caracas, where Cardinal Jorge Urosa was to say Mass, and began attacking parishioners.


Georgia Votes in Critical House Race Seen as Part Trump Referendum
CHAMBLEE, Ga.—The unusual attention paid to a special election in Georgia on Tuesday, as well as recent protests around the country over President Donald Trump's tax returns, show the presidential contest didn't end in November, at least for voters who didn't support the president.
The special election for an Atlanta-area House seat drew extraordinary campaign spending, volumes of political advertising and the attention of Mr. Trump, who recorded automated phone calls and posted Twitter messages in opposition to the leading Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff.
The seat, vacated by former Rep. Tom Price, who joined the Trump administration as Health and Human Services secretary, has been held by a Republican since 1979, when Newt Gingrich took office. A Democratic victory would be widely seen as a sign of strength among voters who oppose Mr. Trump and a signal of potential danger for GOP candidates in the next election.
Mr. Ossoff was holding onto the prospects of an outright win Tuesday night by the narrowest of margins. At 11 p.m., with two-thirds of precincts tallied, he had 50.3% of the vote, just ahead of the share needed to avoid a runoff. Republican Karen Handel was in second place, with about 18% of the vote.
While Mr. Price carried 62% of the vote in his 2016 re-election, Mr. Trump won the district by about 1 point. Sensing a chance to win, Democratic activists from around the nation zeroed in the race, to make the election a referendum on the president's first few months in office.


Man Suspected of Killing Three in California Expressed Dislike of White People, Police Say
A man suspected of shooting three people to death in downtown Fresno, Calif., on Tuesday had expressed his dislike of white people, police said, and authorities are investigating the matter as a hate crime, not a terrorist attack.
The suspected shooter, identified as Kori Ali Muhammad, 39 years old, is in custody. Police said he yelled "Allahu akbar," Arabic for "God is great," as he was being arrested.
That statement initially concerned police about the motive of Mr. Muhammad's alleged actions, but after interrogating Mr. Muhammad Tuesday, police said terrorism wasn't likely a potential motive.
"We do not believe, based on the information we have today, that this is a terrorist-related crime," Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said in an afternoon news conference. "This is solely based on race," the chief said.
Police have been looking for Mr. Muhammad since Thursday evening, when he allegedly shot and killed a security guard and attempted to shoot another security guard at a Fresno Motel 6, they said.


Across Mideast, Mattis Delivers Trump's Message of Reassurance
DOHA, Qatar—The Trump administration's still-emerging foreign policy has come into sharper focus as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis continues a whistle-stop tour through the Middle East, quietly placing building blocks for resetting ties that had become strained under the Obama White House.
Over the past week, Mr. Mattis visited leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel bearing the message that the Trump administration wants to realign with those nations and stressing that Washington and capitals in the region have shared interests, such as fighting terrorism.
But an animating feature of Mr. Mattis's effort is to counter what he repeatedly has described as the malign influence of Iran.
"Everywhere you look, if there's trouble in the region, you find Iran," Mr. Mattis said on a stop in Riyadh, adding that nations in the region are working to "checkmate Iran and the amount of disruption, the amount of instability they cause."
For Mr. Mattis, assembling a coalition to serve as a bulwark against Iran represents a welcome opportunity. When he served as a combatant commander under the Obama administration as a four-star Marine general, Mr. Mattis was harshly critical of Iran, while the White House focused on a nuclear deal with Tehran.


Testing China on North Korea
President Trump called on the United Nations Security Council Monday to adopt new and stronger sanctions on North Korea. Diplomats are skeptical that such measures would change Pyongyang's behavior because it is already economically isolated, doesn't mind inflicting pain on its people, and will never negotiate away its nuclear weapons. A new sanctions push is nonetheless worth a try—not least as a test of Chinese willingness to confront the threat it has helped to nurture.
It's a myth that Pyongyang already faces tough sanctions, since by several measures North Korea is well down the list of sanctions targets. There's plenty of room to tighten financial and trade restrictions on the Kim Jong Un regime. The main obstacle has been China's efforts to water down sanctions and veto tougher measures.
Beijing also has failed to enforce sanctions that it has agreed to. In recent years a U.N. Panel of Experts has documented how Chinese companies and banks violate U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Last year it determined that Bank of China 's Singapore branch allowed 605 payments on behalf of North Korean entities. Beijing blocked the release of that report, though its contents leaked to the press.
Beijing has long viewed the collapse of the Kim regime as a worse threat to China's interests than are the North's nuclear missiles. And previous U.S. administrations chose to tiptoe around China's resistance in the hope of making incremental diplomatic progress.
Mr. Trump has taken a different approach as the North continues to increase its nuclear stockpile and its missile-delivery systems, threatening unilateral action against North Korea while seeking China's help. The Trump Administration is signaling in particular that it won't tolerate a North that can target U.S. cities for destruction with long-range missiles that can carry a nuclear warhead. The U.S. has done this with multiple public statements, private talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and an invitation this week to the entire U.S. Senate for a briefing on the threat.


U.S. Floats Talks With North Korea, Shuns Regime Change
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration said Thursday that it isn't seeking to overthrow North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear-weapons program and would consider holding talks, if Pyongyang pursues "the right agenda."
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. believes that the key to North Korea's survival is to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
"We do not seek regime change in North Korea, we're not seeking a collapse of the regime, we are not seeking to find some excuse for an accelerated reunification," said Mr. Tillerson in a Fox News interview Thursday. "What we are seeking is the same thing China has said they seek: a full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
"We'll wait as long as it takes, as long as the threat is manageable," he said.
Mr. Tillerson on Friday will chair a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to focus on the North Korean threat. Top aides to President Donald Trump said he views North Korea as the No. 1 national security threat facing the U.S.


Congress to Vote Friday on Bill to Keep Government Open for a Week
WASHINGTON—Lawmakers prepared to vote Friday on a weeklong spending bill needed to avoid a shutdown of the U.S. government on Saturday, but Democratic resistance added uncertainty and volatility to the day.
In a related development, Republicans signaled late Thursday that they were still short of the votes needed to revive and pass legislation to replace most of the Affordable Care Act.
House GOP leaders had been trying to corral votes in hopes of passing the bill before President Donald Trump's 100th day in office on Saturday. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Thursday night that the chamber wouldn't vote on the bill Friday or Saturday.
The developments showed the difficulty GOP leaders have faced in trying to come to terms with Democrats on a spending bill to keep the government open after Friday while also pressing forward on a health-care bill uniformly opposed by Democrats.
With the government's funding set to expire Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, Republican leaders have prepared a weeklong stopgap measure that would give lawmakers more time to settle on a spending bill to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.


Brazilian Probe to Continue Despite Bill, Prosecutors Say
SÃO PAULO—The prosecutors leading Brazil's "Car Wash" anticorruption investigation have vowed to push ahead with the probe despite a new bill that they say limits their ability to do their jobs.
Late Wednesday, Brazilian senators—many of whom are among the scores of politicians and businessmen targeted by the probe—voted 54-19 to approve the bill, which would curtail some practices recently used in the investigation, such as detaining suspects for questioning without prior requests, with penalties of up to four years in prison.
The bill—intended to curb "abuses of power"—will now be voted on in the lower house, where it is also expected to pass.
"We will basically ignore [the bill] and go on with our work as ever," said Brazilian prosecutor Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima on Thursday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. "We will not give in," he added.
Senator Roberto Requião, the author of the bill, said Wednesday that it was an update to the existing law and argued the bill wasn't intended to curb police's or prosecutors' powers. Mr. Requião also said on Wednesday that he supports "clean investigations."


U.S. Push for Tougher North Korea Policy Faces Resistance
UNITED NATIONS—The Trump administration tried to unify world leaders behind a tougher approach toward North Korea on Friday, but risked finding itself more isolated amid stiff resistance from China and Russia, which accused the U.S. of ratcheting up tensions.
North Korea itself punctuated the debate later in the day by firing a ballistic missile, one of a series of tests that have signaled the country's determination to move ahead with its weapons program despite international condemnation. The missile launch appeared to fail, blowing up after launch, according to South Korea, but its timing could bolster the U.S. effort to rally an international response.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson convened the session of the United Nation Security Council and called for member states to increase sanctions on Pyongyang and suspend or downgrade diplomatic relations with Kim Jong Un's regime.
But in the contentious session, Chinese and Russian diplomats sought to shift the blame for the nuclear crisis to Washington. Moscow's deputy foreign minister accused President Donald Trump of "reckless muscle flexing" by sending more military assets to the Korean Peninsula. "The whole world is seriously wondering if there is going to be a war," the minister, Gennady Gatilov, told the council.
U.S. officials also feared there could be serious damage to its Asian security alliance after Mr. Trump, in an interview, called for South Korea to pay for the deployment of a U.S.-built missile defense system, Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense, or Thaad, and to renegotiate or scrap the countries' bilateral trade pact.


Trump Returns to a Keystone of His Win
President Donald Trump returns Saturday to a state that proved crucial to his election victory, appearing at a rally in Pennsylvania to mark his 100th day in office and proclaim the start of his term a success.
Mr. Trump had the campaign-style rally on his mind this week as the milestone neared, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he expects a "big, big crowd."
"The only problem is the arena only holds 10,000 people," he said from behind his desk in the Oval Office.
The president had planned to use the forum to highlight a decision to pull out of the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. But he scrapped that idea after calls from his Mexican and Canadian counterparts persuaded him to instead renegotiate the deal.
So Mr. Trump will now devote the appearance to what he sees as his achievements at this early point in his term. Aides have been citing the confirmation of his Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, along with his efforts to roll back regulations that they see as crimping job creation and economic growth.


National Security Chief Tells South Korea U.S. Will Pay for Defense System
SEOUL—White House national-security chief Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster told his South Korean counterpart that the U.S. would pay for a missile-defense system designed to protect against a North Korean missile attack, but said hours later that the U.S. could later seek renegotiation on payment for the roughly $1 billion battery.
Gen. McMaster's remarks came days after President Donald Trump rattled South Korea with remarks on Thursday suggesting that South Korea should pay for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad.
"What I told our South Korean counterpart is until any renegotiation that the deal is in place. We'll adhere to our word," Gen. McMaster said on Fox News.
Gen. McMaster's remarks came after a 35-minute phone call on Sunday morning in Seoul with Kim Kwan-jin, South Korea's national-security adviser, that the U.S. would finance Thaad as agreed to by the two countries last year, South Korea's presidential Blue House said.
During that phone call, Gen. McMaster also praised the U.S. alliance with South Korea as "the most solid alliance" and as Washington's priority in the region, saying that "the U.S. will be with the Republic of Korea 100%," using the formal name for South Korea.


White House Dismisses Criticism Over Duterte
WASHINGTON—The White House on Monday tried to bat away criticism of President Donald Trump's decision to invite the Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte to Washington.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Mr. Trump sees the invitation to Mr. Duterte—who has waged a brutal and deadly antidrug campaign since he took office last year—as part of the Trump administration's efforts to enlist countries in the region to further diplomatically and economically isolate North Korea.
"The national interests of the United States, the safety of our people and the safety of people in the region are the No. 1 priorities of the president," Mr. Spicer said Monday.
Mr. Trump extended the invitation to Mr. Duterte in a phone call on Saturday, which the White House described as "very friendly." A White House statement about the call made no mention of any criticism of Mr. Duterte's human-rights record.
Rights groups and lawmakers strongly criticized the invitation, pointing to Mr. Duterte's bloody antinarcotics campaign that has killed more than 8,000 people.


Yates to Testify on Warnings Over Flynn
Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is expected to testify before Congress next week that she warned White House officials that former national security adviser Michael Flynn wasn't being truthful when he denied having discussed U.S. sanctions with a top Russian diplomat, according to people familiar with her version of events.
The testimony is likely to contradict White House assertions that Ms. Yates had merely given White House counsel Donald McGahn a "heads up" in a Jan. 26 meeting that Mr. Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with a Russian diplomat.
The vice president had earlier said that Mr. Flynn hadn't discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The conversations between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak took place on Dec. 29, the same day the Obama administration levied sanctions on Moscow for alleged meddling in the U.S. election. The timing of the conversation was coincidental, said Mr. Pence.
In fact, Mr. Flynn discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak and misled Mr. Pence about the nature of the conversations, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of the diplomat's phone calls, former officials have said.
Ms. Yates is expected to testify that she expressed alarm to Mr. McGahn about the conflict between what transpired in the phone calls and how the White House was describing the conversations. She also told Mr. McGahn that the national security adviser's false assertions put himself at risk of being compromised by Russian intelligence operatives, the people said.


VA Looks at Closing More Than 1,000 Underused Buildings
WASHINGTON—The Department of Veterans Affairs is considering shutting down more than a thousand vacant or underused buildings at VA facilities across the country, as part of a Trump administration streamlining initiative, the head of the department said Wednesday.
VA Secretary David Shulkin told a House subcommittee his department is considering closing or re-evaluating the use of 1,166 underused or vacant buildings at the VA in a process that could resemble the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission system, known as BRAC, used by the military to determine which facilities to shed.
The VA has nearly 2,000 facilities across the nation, according to the department's online database, and many have multiple buildings. The VA could not immediately provide a total number of buildings it operates nationwide.
"Whether the BRAC is a model that we should take a look at, we're beginning to have discussions with members of Congress about their suggestions," Dr. Shulkin told a House Appropriations Committee subpanel on veterans affairs, adding that the department could save some $25 million a year by closing targeted facilities.
"We want to reinvest that in the buildings that we know have capital needs," he added.


We'll Always Have Paris, Unless the Senate Has Its Say
Expect some clarity soon on America's future participation in the Paris Agreement on climate. Several cabinet members, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, want to stay in, but at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, President Trump called Paris a one-sided deal that would shrink the economy by $2.5 trillion over 10 years.
According to reports this week, Mr. Trump is leaning toward withdrawal, but aides warn that he could face trouble in U.S. courts if he fails to uphold the Obama administration's commitments under Paris. But there is a third approach—submitting the agreement to the Senate for ratification.
Some advocates of staying in argue that America's moral and political commitment under the agreement is not legally binding because the accord doesn't have an enforcement mechanism. But neither the North Atlantic Treaty nor the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has an enforcement provision, and both were submitted to the Senate. Neither of them have a compliance mechanism either—unlike the Paris Agreement, which provides for one in Article 15.
But does an international agreement have legal force at all if the Senate hasn't ratified it? That's unclear. During Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on the 1992 U.N. climate convention, the administration of George H.W. Bush pledged to submit future climate protocols to the Senate. Senior Senate Republicans might now wish Paris would go away, but letting it stand without Senate consent would create a standard that would have permitted "accepting"—the word President Obama used for joining the Paris Agreement—the U.N. climate convention and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol without Senate consent. A senatorial prerogative written into the Constitution would be lost.
And an administration that has already had three executive orders blocked by the courts should assume it will face litigation over any loosening of emissions regulations. Will judges view Paris as legally binding? No one disputes that under some circumstances, the president can bind the U.S. by a unilateral executive agreement. The conundrum is determining at the outset whether the Paris Agreement falls into that category. Sending it to the Senate would provide an answer; not doing so cannot guarantee that it is not binding.


Fire Forces Evacuations in Southern Georgia
FOLKSTON, Ga.—A mandatory evacuation order was issued Saturday for a town in Georgia's southernmost county after a wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp began encroaching onto private property.
The evacuation order covered the entirety of St. George, Ga., an unincorporated community of about 2,000 people. The evacuation initially included a sparsely populated rural area of Charlton County. County Administrator Shawn Boatright couldn't immediately say how many residents might be affected in the latter area.
Lightning started the wildfire on April 6 and it has since burned more than 150 square miles on public lands. It has burned almost entirely within the Okefenokee refuge boundaries—and some public forestland in north Florida—for the past month, but it escaped fire breaks around the refuge Friday and has burned an estimated 1,000 acres on private land.
The area, on the Georgia-Florida line, is also under a dense smoke advisory that is expected to affect visibility in Charlton County and northern Duval County, Fla., near the Jacksonville International Airport.
Mr. Boatright said a temporary shelter that had been opened in the gymnasium at the Folkston Elementary School would stay open indefinitely.


Theresa May Is No Maggie Thatcher
Unflashy, camera-shy, socially awkward and a hit with British voters—at least, the English and Welsh variety—Theresa May is leading her Conservative troops into battle as the self-proclaimed champion of "ordinary working people" ahead of June's general election.
Coming from almost any other Tory, this might have been a cheeky joke at the clique of half-baked revolutionaries in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's camp. But Mrs. May doesn't "do" jokes. If she wins the sweeping Conservative victory she seeks, Britons will have given their mandate to an unabashed interventionist, passionately convinced of "the good that government can do" and the duty of the state to mend society's ills, curb capitalism's excesses and stand as a bulwark against the unsettling forces of globalization.
Welcome back—just possibly—to the pre-Thatcher Britain I grew up in, the land that coined the word "Butskellism." A conflation of the surnames of the Tory Party's Rab Butler and Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell, Butskellism was shorthand for a left-leaning, corporatist postwar mind-set in both main parties. Fear of change—and, in the Tory case, fear of an increasingly welfare-dependent electorate—kept much of the economy unprofitably in state hands for fear of committing the crime of "selling off the family silver," and the whole country in thrall to over-mighty trade unions.
It trapped politicians into generally fruitless efforts to banish stagflation by controlling prices and wages, and to ward off economic decline with "industrial strategies" that mainly amounted to subsidizing flagging industries. These were decades sacrificed to a bungling corporatism, culminating in the late 1970s in near-bankruptcy. They should have taught us that the most untrustworthy of all political phenomena is "a safe pair of hands."
Margaret Thatcher took risks; calculated risks, for the most part. Like the Greek goddess Pallas Athene, she took care to pick battles she could win, but she was no less a radical for that because at its core hers was a gamble that the British could be persuaded that the key to national recovery was to reward individual effort, encourage ambition and open up the marketplace to competition.


Inequality and Equality Each Have Some Negatives
"Inequality Isn't the Real Issue" (Review, April 29) correctly points out that what people really care about is fairness or equality of opportunity. The authors fail to mention, however, the main reason why inequality is seen today as such a great threat. Many Trump, Sanders and Le Pen voters believe the system is rigged against them, implying a perceived inequality of opportunity. No matter how hard they work, they aren't getting ahead. Rather, the gap in opportunity and wealth is increasing. In turn, inequalities in outcomes that ought to serve as a positive incentive are instead viewed as a self-perpetuating, uneven playing field.
Joshua P. Cohen
Boston
You need to ask whether an unequal distribution is better than a more equal one if the total rewards are significantly larger in the unequal one. Given the relative performance of such "equal" societies as Cuba, Venezuela and the Soviet Union versus the unequal West, I am sure unequal would come out far ahead.


California Arrests 49 Suspected Gang Members in Crackdown
MERCED, Calif.—Hundreds of law-enforcement officers descended on a Northern California county on Wednesday and arrested 49 suspected gang members and seized 120 firearms, including assault rifles and automatic weapons, California's top prosecutor said.
Attorney General Xavier Becerra said 500 local, state and federal officers swooped into dozens of Merced County neighborhoods in predawn raids targeting Sureno gang members.
"Some of the most violent criminals in our community have been taken off our streets along with many of the weapons they use to commit murder and mayhem," said Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse.
Officers also confiscated $170,261 in cash and seized cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine with a street value of $1.7 million, Mr. Becerra said.
The raids come after a year-long investigation of violent crimes involving Sureno gang members working for the Mexican Mafia prison gang, Mr. Becerra said.


Senate Panel Subpoenas Documents From Flynn in Russia Probe
The Senate Intelligence Committee, has subpoenaed documents from Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, as part of its probe into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
The legal action marks an escalation in tensions between the Senate committee and a former high-level Trump associate and signals that the congressional investigation is sharpening its focus on former members of the president's campaign.
The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued the subpoena after an earlier attempt to obtain information from Mr. Flynn voluntarily was unsuccessful.
The former three-star Army general and head of the Defense Intelligence Agency was forced to resign from his post as White House national security adviser after misleading fellow administration officials about the nature of his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.
Mr. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to comment on the subpoena.


Where's the ACLU When You Need It?
'Health care access is a civil rights issue," declared a recent email blast. "Tell your representative to vote NO on repealing the ACA." It could have come from any progressive advocacy group, but what made it remarkable was its source: the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU was once a nonpartisan organization focused on liberty and equality before the law. In recent years it has chosen its battles with an increasingly left-wing sensibility. In doing so, it has become considerably more equivocal and sometimes even hostile toward core civil liberties concerns of free speech and due process.
When asked, ACLU officials are still apt to critique progressive efforts to censor "hateful" or "discriminatory" speech. If you look, you can find a page on the organization's website opposing campus speech codes. You can find instances of ACLU affiliates opposing campus "free-speech zones" and other acts of censorship. You can hear an ACLU attorney defend the speech rights of Milo Yiannopoulos and read her First Amendment critique of an incitement lawsuit against President Trump. But you will also find the ACLU attaching "trigger warnings" to blog posts.
On balance, the organization has been a quiet friend more than an active opponent of campus censorship. How often have you heard the ACLU speak out against progressive censors? How often have you seen it quoted defending speech in coverage of censorship news, like the violent protests of Charles Murray's talk at Middlebury College? Did you hear it criticize the wrongful removal of several Jewish students from a pro-Palestinian lecture at Brooklyn College? Did you hear the ACLU condemn the vilification of former Yale instructor Erika Christakis for urging students to "think critically" about rather than demand bans on "offensive" Halloween costumes? We didn't.
Instead, the ACLU responded to the Yale incident by chastising free-speech advocates for their "refusal to confront . . . discrimination and inequality on campus." Local ACLU officials offered a perverse free-speech defense of Muslim students who attempted to exercise a heckler's veto and shut down a speech by Israel's then-ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, at the University of California, Irvine.


U.S. Seizes Assets From Lobbyist Allegedly Tied to Gabon's Leader
Federal agents have seized nearly a half-million dollars from a Washington lobbyist accused of helping the ruling family of Gabon and other clients evade money-laundering regulations.
The lobbyist, Joseph Szlavik, received millions of dollars from Gabon, Abu Dhabi, and Switzerland in an account he set up at Citizens Bank and disbursed the funds at the direction of his clients, according to forfeiture documents filed by federal prosecutors this week in Washington, D.C.
The forfeiture complaint sought $475,405 from accounts linked to Mr. Szlavik, owner of lobbying firm Scribe Strategies & Advisors, which has offices in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Prosecutors said the funds were the proceeds of "an unlicensed international money transmitting business."
Mr. Szlavik hasn't been charged with criminal wrongdoing. He didn't return calls or emails seeking comment.
Forfeiture laws allow the government to take assets that are linked to crimes, such as the proceeds of corruption or drug-trafficking. In civil forfeiture, prosecutors don't have to convict anyone of a crime, but they have to show in court that, more likely than not, the property they are seeking to recover is traceable to a crime.


U.N. Security Council Holds Talks on North Korea
United Nations—The United Nations Security Council on Tuesday held a closed-door, emergency meeting on North Korea, holding talks on new sanctions in response to the country's latest ballistic missile test.
The U.S. and China were negotiating a resolution that would implement new sanctions and tighten existing penalties on Pyongyang, diplomats said. China is North Korea's main ally at the U.N. and has in the past advocated for direct negotiations rather than economic and military punishment.
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that the international community had to send North Korea a "no more" signal and said the U.S. would be willing to talk to North Korea only if the country abandoned its nuclear and missile program.
"This is not play time. This is serious. These threats are not welcome," said Ms. Haley, speaking to reporters before the Council meeting.
Ms. Haley also said that the U.S. would be identifying countries that still supplied and supported North Korea and could target them for sanctions.


Loose Lips Sink Presidencies
The state of the Trump Presidency has been perpetual turbulence, which seems to be how the principal likes it. The latest vortex is over Mr. Trump's disclosure of sensitive intel to the Russians—and whatever the particulars of the incident, the danger is that Presidencies can withstand only so much turbulence before they come apart.
The Washington Post reported Monday night that in an Oval Office meeting last week Mr. Trump relayed high-level "code word" classified material obtained from an ally to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Cue another Washington meltdown. The President took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to defend himself, claiming an "absolute right" to disclose "facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety."
National Security AdviserH.R. McMaster put a finer point on it at a Tuesday press conference, though without denying key details. He said Mr. Trump's disclosure was "wholly appropriate" and didn't expose intelligence sources and methods.
Presidents sometimes share secrets with overseas leaders—even to adversaries such as the Soviets during the Cold War—if they conclude the benefits of showing what the U.S. knows will aid diplomacy or strategic interests. From media accounts and his tweets, Mr. Trump said something about Islamic State's laptop bomb threat to airlines. He may well have been trying to convince the envoys of the menace ISIS poses to Russian lives and foreign-policy goals, like the Russian airliner that exploded over Sinai in 2015.
Then again, the Post story has Mr. Trump boasting about how great U.S. intelligence is and divulging the info on impulse to prove it. National security officials also asked the reporters to withhold specifics about the item in question, presumably because further disclosure could undermine efforts to counter the threat or endanger the lives of human assets.


The Trump Tumult Is Too Much
Firing FBI Director James Comey was fully within President Trump's rights. The question is whether that decision was wise or will end up crippling his presidency.
First, the firing itself. As Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein detailed in a May 9 memo, Mr. Comey overstepped his authority last July when he announced that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her private email server. That decision belonged to the attorney general. Then Mr. Comey proceeded to trash Mrs. Clinton, which Mr. Rosenstein called "a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do."
That's not all. Last October, when Mr. Comey announced the FBI had reopened the Clinton investigation, he violated "longstanding policy" to "refrain from publicizing non-public information." Yet Mr. Comey showed no remorse. The week before his firing he told Congress that even in hindsight he "wouldn't have done it any differently."
All that said, the execution of his firing could not have been worse. For one thing, the president looked petty. Instead of bringing Mr. Comey to the Oval Office to dismiss him, Mr. Trump dispatched his longtime bodyguard to FBI headquarters with a terse letter. Apparently, no one at the White House knew Mr. Comey was on a trip to the West Coast.
Keeping White House communications staffers in the dark until shortly before Mr. Comey's firing made the action look ill-prepared and hasty. After the president was pummeled for hours in the evening's news coverage, three aides were finally dispatched to face a ravenous pack of journalists.


Democratic Attorneys General Seek to Preserve Affordable Care Act Subsidies
More than a dozen Democratic state attorneys general took legal action Thursday seeking to preserve billions of dollars in federal subsidy payments for insurers under a provision of the Affordable Care Act after President Donald Trump threatened to halt the funding.
The group, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, filed a motion to intervene in a House Republican lawsuit over the payments. GOP lawmakers have asserted that the payments to insurers are illegal because Congress never appropriated the funding.
The move reflects widening concern over the fate of the payments, which are taking center stage in the health policy debate.
Insurers are warning they will raise premium rates or leave the ACA's fragile exchanges in 2018 if the federal government ends the funding. That could be a near-fatal blow to the exchanges, bringing higher costs and a dearth of insurer options for consumers.
"Millions of families across the country—including hundreds of thousands right here in New York—rely on these subsidies for their basic health care," Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement about the motion, which was filed in the pending case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.


Comey Agrees to Testify Publicly
WASHINGTON—Former FBI Director James Comey is set to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee after Memorial Day, the panel's leaders announced Friday evening, and is expected to deliver his first public remarks since being fired by President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Mr. Comey agreed to testify in a public forum and likely will shed light on the circumstances surrounding his departure from the Federal Bureau of Investigation as it was conducting a politically charged probe into whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates improperly coordinated with the Russian government.
The date and time of the hearing will be scheduled after the Memorial Day holiday, May 29, the panel's leaders said in a joint statement.
"I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media," said Sen. Richard Burr (R, N.C), the panel's chairman in a statement.
"Director Comey served his country with honor for many years, and he deserves an opportunity to tell his story," said Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the committee and a Virginia Democrat. "Moreover, the American people deserve an opportunity to hear it."


Anthony Weiner Pleads Guilty Following Sexting Probe
NEW YORK—Former Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, whose "sexting" scandals ended his political career, pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday to exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor.
Mr. Weiner, 52 years old, pleaded guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor, which has no mandatory minimum prison sentence but carries up to 10 years in prison. On Friday, prosecutors said they would ask for a sentence between 21 months and 27 months.
Although the scope of the criminal case against Mr. Weiner was relatively narrow, the public airing of his interactions with the minor during the 2016 presidential campaign made the case politically explosive. Many Democrats say the case contributed to the defeat of the party's candidate, Hillary Clinton.
On Friday, Mr. Weiner said in court that in early 2016, a 15-year-old high-school student contacted him, and he began to exchange obscene communications with her, "encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct" for a few months.
Mr. Weiner wept as he explained himself to a Manhattan federal judge, pausing multiple times to wipe his eyes and collect himself. "I knew this was as morally wrong as it was unlawful," Mr. Weiner said to a packed courtroom. "I have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse."


Poland's EU Isolation Spells Trouble Ahead
These are delicate times for Poland's relationship with the European Union.
The political upheavals in Europe over the past year took many by surprise, but few have been so wrong-footed as the Polish government. Until last June, Warsaw's diplomatic priority was to forge an alliance with the U.K. to push for a looser European Union.
When this strategy was blown apart by Brexit, Warsaw continued to call for a looser EU, arguing that this was the best way to prevent further populist revolts. Now Poland looks strategically isolated for a second time: following Emmanuel Macron's election as president of France, it is deeper integration that now tops the EU agenda.
Poland's strategic isolation is compounded by political isolation. Warsaw is engaged in a long-running feud with the European Commission over reforms to the country's constitutional court which Brussels says undermine the independence of the judiciary and threaten the rule of law. This feud escalated last week when ministers from EU member states for the first time formally discussed how to respond to Poland's alleged violation of EU values.
Warsaw is also at odds with Brussels over a new asylum policy that requires it to accept a share of refugees in the Schengen passport-free travel zone. And earlier this year Warsaw was outvoted 27 to 1 when it tried to block the re-election of former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk as president of the European Council.


Deregulators Must Follow the Law, So Regulators Will Too
President Trump has committed—and rightly so—to roll back unnecessary regulations that eliminate jobs, inhibit job creation, or impose costs that exceed their benefits. American workers and families deserve good, safe jobs, and unnecessary impediments to job creation are a disservice to all working Americans. As the Labor Department approaches this regulatory rollback, we will keep in mind two core principles: respect for the individual and respect for the rule of law.
America was founded on the belief that people should be trusted to govern themselves. Citizens sit on juries and decide the fate of their fellow citizens. Voters elect their representatives to Washington. By the same token, Americans should be trusted to exercise individual choice and freedom of contract. At a practical level, this means Washington should regulate only when necessary. Limiting the scope of government protects space for people to make their own judgments about what is best for their families.
The rule of law is America's other great contribution to the modern world. Engraved above the doors of the Supreme Court are the words "Equal Justice Under Law." Those four words announce that no one is above the law, that everyone is entitled to its protections, and that Washington must, first and foremost, follow its own rules. This means federal agencies can act only as the law allows: The law sets limits on their power and establishes procedures they must follow when they regulate—or deregulate.
The Administrative Procedure Act is one of these laws. Congress had good reason to adopt it: In the modern world, regulations are akin in power to statutes, but agency heads are not elected. Thus, before an agency can regulate or deregulate, it must generally provide notice and seek public comment. The process ensures that all Americans—workers, small businesses, corporations, communities—have an opportunity to express their concerns before a rule is written or changed. Agency heads have a legal duty to consider all the views expressed before adopting a final rule.
Today there are several regulations enacted by the Obama administration that federal courts have declared unlawful. One is the Persuader Rule, which would make it harder for businesses to obtain legal advice. Even the American Bar Association believes the rule goes too far. Last year a federal judge held that "the rule is defective to its core" and blocked its implementation. Now the Labor Department will engage in a new rule-making process, proposing to rescind the rule.


Trump Retains Marc Kasowitz as Private Lawyer in Russia Probe
President Donald Trump has retained his longtime lawyer Marc Kasowitz to serve on a team of private attorneys representing him in the special-counsel probe of his associates' ties to Russia, two senior White House officials said Tuesday.
The move comes as the federal investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election escalated last week with the appointment of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller III as special counsel. The move gives Mr. Mueller wide latitude to explore potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow and other issues.
The appointment of a special counsel marked a significant new phase in the high-stakes investigation into alleged Russian electoral meddling, which has swept up the Trump administration and bogged down Congress in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia and has said he hopes the probe—which he has dubbed a "witch hunt"—will soon end.
Mr. Kasowitz couldn't be reached to comment.
Mr. Trump's decision to hire a private attorney comes ahead of expected testimony by James Comey, the former FBI director that Mr. Trump fired earlier this month. Mr. Comey is expected to testify after Memorial Day, according to the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and will almost certainly face questions surrounding the circumstances of his dismissal, which has created a crisis for the White House in recent weeks.


Let the Private Sector Help Tackle the Migration Crisis
As the most powerful leaders in the world gather in Sicily this week for the annual Group of Seven Summit, they will address today's most pressing challenges. The list is daunting—terrorism, famine, geopolitical instability and uncontrolled immigration, to name a few. A bolder, broader approach is essential if lives are to be saved.
The statistics drive home the severity of the problem. Conflict or persecution has displaced 65 million citizens—more than at any time in history. Nearly 100,000 of the asylum seekers are unaccompanied children. If it were a state, this vulnerable population would constitute the 21st-largest country in the world. Another 20 million people, including 1.4 million children, are at risk of death from imminent famines in places such as Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.
The debilitating impact of these issues is contagious and can weaken the will of us all. In fact, the Aurora Humanitarian Index, an international survey released this week, reveals just 9% of the respondents believe they can make a difference in solving the global refugee crisis.
The world needs new recruits to succeed in addressing today's challenges. For decades, the G-7, G-20 and United Nations have declared commitments to save the most vulnerable from war, famine, disease and other calamities. At last fall's U.N. General Assembly, global leaders pledged more assistance to countries where populations are at risk, better access to education for children, more humanitarian aid, and increased help for resettling refugees. The challenge for leaders gathering at the G-7 summit in Italy this weekend is how they can mobilize global support for a comprehensive action plan that implements the U.N.'s declarations.
Any such plan should consider several additional tools to overcome inaction and galvanize progress.


U.S. Plans Missile Defense Test Amid Concern Over North Korea
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon is planning to conduct a test next week of a system designed to shoot down intercontinental missiles, U.S. defense officials said, amid heightening concerns of North Korea's bellicose behavior.
The test, expected Tuesday, will entail the launch of a mock intercontinental ballistic missile from a test site in the Marshall Islands. A U.S. "interceptor" then will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., according to defense officials.
The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said the simulation will test the capabilities of what is known as the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, element of the U.S. ballistic missile defense system.
The U.S. ground-based missile-defense system has been tested 17 times since 1999, succeeding in nine of those tests, according to the agency.
In addition to dozens of ground-based interceptors, the Missile Defense Agency maintains warships with missile defense capabilities and missile-defense batteries known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, along with a global network of radar and sensors.


OAS Convenes Emergency Session to Discuss Venezuela
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration and its regional allies stepped up efforts to mobilize an internationally mediated end to Venezuela's political crisis, including holding an emergency session of the Organization of American States on Wednesday.
The Venezuelan government headed by Nicolás Maduro, along with left-leaning governments in the region, however, indicated they might seek to block any outside solution.
Mr. Maduro's government wasn't represented at the meeting in Washington, and Venezuela has started the process of exiting the OAS.
Bolivia and Nicaragua said any OAS mediation would mark a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.
Luis Ezequiel Alvarado, a Nicaraguan diplomat, called the OAS's emergency session "illicit and unfriendly," as well as subversive to the international order.


Trump's Blue State Revival Plan
Chuck Schumer aspires to raise taxes on every rich person in America, save one protected class: coastal progressives. The Senate Minority Leader recently styled part of President Trump's tax plan as "a dagger aimed at the heart" of New Yorkers. Like many other Democrats, he's apoplectic about a plan to end the state and local tax deduction.
Taxpayers who itemize—about one in three do so—can deduct income and property taxes paid to state and local governments from their federal tax liability. The White House in its recent tax outline proposes eliminating the deduction, and the House blueprint does as well.
One goal of tax reform is to reduce unproductive tax loopholes, and ending the state and local deduction would generate revenue to finance lower rates: The deduction is worth about $100 billion a year—the sixth largest individual income tax break. The Tax Foundation estimates that eliminating the write-off would raise $1.8 trillion in revenue over a decade.
While Democrats like to soak the affluent, they make an exception for the state and local deduction: About 88% of the benefits in 2014 flowed to taxpayers who earn more than $100,000, while 1% went to those who earn less than $50,000. California alone reaps nearly 20% of the benefit, according to the Tax Foundation, and a mere six states get more than half. (See the table nearby.)
Even those figures don't capture the saturation. The average deduction in New York County, N.Y., i.e., Manhattan, is a few bucks shy of $25,000. The top 10 counties are in four states, including San Francisco County, Calif. ($12,116) and Morris County, N.J. ($11,440). The folks underwriting this windfall are in Alaska, South Dakota, Wyoming and other places without a state income tax. Those filers pay more to make up for what the federal government leaves on the table to help high-tax states.


Notable & Quotable: The Connecticut Mystery
From "Schools Suddenly Improve After Criticism by DeVos" by Chris Powell, New York Sun, May 31:
For years the school systems in Connecticut's cities have been acknowledged as terrible, most of all by themselves, as those city school systems have sued state government charging that they fail because state government unconstitutionally underfunds them. Deciding the lawsuit last September, a Superior Court judge, Thomas G. Moukawsher, agreed. He'd heard testimony from city school officials that state education policy is mainly social promotion and that city schools long have been giving high school diplomas to illiterates.
Last week, though, President Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, changed all that. In testimony to Congress, she argued that because many public schools are failing, federal money should be diverted to alternative schools to provide choice. In support of her argument, Mrs. DeVos told of having met at a community college in Florida a young man who described himself as a product of the school system in East Hartford and who learned little there even as he was promoted from grade to grade and through high school, where disruptive students were in charge, where he was constantly bullied, and where teachers were indifferent to what he described as "dangerous day care."
Suddenly things in Connecticut's city schools turned around.


Keep California's Bar Exam Fair and Useful
California should stay the course. Of the three bar exams I've passed (New York, California, New Jersey), I consider California's to be the most fair ("State's Bar Put to the Test," U.S. News, June 1). The two days of essays and work assignments gave examiners ample opportunity to measure applicants' ability to analyze, write and apply their knowledge of the applicable law to given fact patterns and assignments, and the test covered all the major subject areas.
As for the multistate section, it is more a reading-comprehension test that requires fluency with English and an ability to quickly read or scan long passages. If you've plowed through bar review workbooks, you've undoubtedly already encountered numerous examples of almost every problem on the test.

U.K. Election: Testing Times for Pollsters Who Got It So Wrong Last Time
Britons go to the polls on Thursday to cast their vote in an uncertain election, with pollsters agreeing only on one thing: that the commanding lead enjoyed by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May has shrunk dramatically during the six-week campaign.
Just as this election has tested Mrs. May's leadership, so it is testing Britain's polling firms.
Opinion polls published by a dozen or so firms in the final days before voting have shown a wide variation in the size of the Conservative lead, from as little as 1 percentage point over the main opposition Labour Party to a 12-point gap.
Quirks of Britain's Parliamentary system mean that such discrepancies present an unusual range of possible outcomes at Thursday's election.
Mrs. May could return with the big majority in Parliament she says will strengthen her hand in coming Brexit talks with Brussels. She could limp back into government much diminished. Or the Conservatives could lose enough seats to give other parties the chance to club together and govern instead.


Pro-EU Voters Make Their Voices Heard
Brexit-supporting British tabloids dubbed them "Re-moaners"—supporters of staying in the European Union who had struggled to come to terms with the result of last year's Brexit referendum.
An exit poll following Thursday's national election suggested there might be more of them than pollsters thought.
The Liberal Democrats, the only party in Britain's national election to suggest the country would be better off if it remained within the EU, were projected to win 14 seats, according to an exit poll sponsored by British broadcasters. If that prediction was borne out in the final results, the party would add six seats to its existing tally of eight, marking its best performance in a national election since 2010.
The potential gain is larger than many pollsters predicted. The party had been struggling in opinion polls before the vote, rarely polling higher than 7% or 8%, a similar share to what it picked up in the previous election in 2015.
Surveys had suggested that opponents of Brexit had resigned themselves to the result of last year's referendum, when Britons voted 52% to 48% to leave the EU. A May survey of more than 5,000 voters by polling firm YouGov PLC found that about half of those who voted to remain in June 2016 believed the government had a duty to implement the public's decision.


EU's 'Door Remains Open' to U.K., Macron Tells May
PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron said the door remains open for the U.K. to stay in the European Union, reflecting uncertainties over coming exit negotiations as politically weakened U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May tries to plot a course out of the bloc.
Mr. Macron made his comments standing alongside Mrs. May after the two dined together in Paris on Tuesday. The dinner brought Mrs. May face to face with a politically emboldened defender of the EU just days after losing her parliamentary majority in elections.
Mrs. May's bruising setback has blurred the U.K.'s strategy for Brexit negotiations that are due to start in less than a week. With weakened support, she could struggle to deliver her campaign promise of hard-nosed negotiations to get a clean break with the EU.
"The door obviously remains open so long as the Brexit talks aren't concluded," Mr. Macron said.
Mr. Macron said he respects the British vote to exit and said once the negotiations start it would be harder to make a U-turn.


Washington Isn't Istanbul
Washington has enough problems today without having to add other nations' bad habits to the local political culture. Thus it's good news that the D.C. police have issued arrest warrants for 12 members of the security detail that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan brought to the nation's capital last month.
Apparently believing that Istanbul rules apply anywhere, the security men attacked and beat up anti-Erdogan protesters in front of the Turkish embassy on Massachusetts Avenue. Recordings show them kicking and beating the protesters in Sheridan Circle. Nine protesters ended up in the hospital, and two U.S. Secret Service officers and one D.C. cop were injured in the melee. Seven of the Turks face felony assault charges.
The arrest warrants are symbolic because the accused are back in Turkey, but they send an important message. This may be another day at the office for Mr. Erdogan's thugs, but it isn't normal behavior in the United States, where peaceful protest is protected by the Constitution, and that includes protesting against foreign heads of state.
We understand the concerns about foreign governments attempting to file criminal charges against U.S. diplomats or military personnel while serving overseas. Diplomatic immunity often protects offenses committed in the U.S. by foreign officials. The U.S. also has important security interests with Turkey and the hyper-sensitive Mr. Erdogan. But the D.C. police are right to use this incident to draw a bright line. The U.S. welcome mat for foreign leaders doesn't include turning assaults on protesters by security agents into another of the city's tourist attractions.


Afghan Soldier Shoots, Wounds Seven U.S. Troops
An Afghan commando turned his weapon on U.S. troops at the Afghan army's northern headquarters and wounded at least seven American soldiers, U.S. and Afghan military officials said Saturday.
It was the second insider attack among the country's elite forces in just over a week, after an Afghan commando fired on U.S. soldiers during an operation in the east, killing three U.S. soldiers and wounding a fourth.
The Taliban issued a statement praising the soldier, described as Masood from eastern Paktia province. The group didn't explicitly say whether Masood was working for the insurgency or had acted on his own.
"This attack occurs at a time when the Americans want to send more troops to Afghanistan and further test the nation's intention to carry on the fight," the Taliban said in a statement.
The U.S. military confirmed that seven of its soldiers had been wounded in an incident at Camp Shaheen, the Afghan army's northern headquarters, and said the troops had been evacuated for treatment.


Palestinians Kill Israeli Police Officer; ISIS Claim Is Rebutted
TEL AVIV—Stabbing attacks by Palestinian militants in Jerusalem left an Israeli police officer dead, Israeli officials said Saturday, but authorities cast doubt on a claim by Islamic State that its fighters were responsible for the assaults.
The three attackers also lightly injured several other officers and civilians before security forces shot them dead in locations outside Jerusalem's Old City on Friday evening, Israeli police said. One of the assailants had a gun that jammed, avoiding more serious casualties, the police added.
Sergeant Major Hadas Malka, 23 years old, was stabbed while engaging the attackers and later died of her wounds, Israeli officials said.
The bloodshed on Friday ended a lull in Palestinian violence against Israelis after a wave of attacks that began in September 2015 had largely abated in recent months in part due to greater security coordination between Israeli and Palestinian security forces.
Islamic State quickly took responsibility for the attacks, but Israeli authorities said they had no evidence to support the extremist group's claims, which were also dismissed by other Palestinian militant groups.


A Terrorist's Guide to New York City
The New York City Council is the distilled political essence of modern progressivism, which means it can be dangerous to public health and safety. This summer tourists can see more New Yorkers relieving their bladders in public thanks to the council's reduction in penalties for crimes against public order, and now the council wants to expose the city's antiterror secrets.
A new bill would require the New York Police Department to disclose and describe all "surveillance technology," which it defines as "equipment, software, or system capable of, or used or designed for, collecting, retaining, processing, or sharing audio, video, location, thermal, biometric, or similar information." The cops would have to post this information online annually and respond to public comments.
The effort is backed by such anti-antiterror stalwarts as the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Brennan Center. Manhattan Democrat Daniel Garodnick, a co-sponsor, says the measure would enhance public trust by giving citizens more knowledge about policing techniques.
We'll see how long that trust lasts if the bill makes it easier for terrorists to thwart or evade the NYPD's antiterror methods. That's the legitimate worry of police who rely on technology and surveillance to prevent mass murder. A jihadist bombed Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood as recently as September and the department maintains on average three or four active terrorist investigations at any one time. John Miller, the NYPD's counterterror chief, says police have foiled at least 25 major terror attacks since 9/11.
New York's cops are as respectful of privacy as any in the country, and they need a court order to conduct searches or track a cellphone. They also comply with the court-ordered Handschu guidelines that impose additional due-process burdens.


In Georgia House Race, Battle for New Swing Voters
CHAMBLEE, Ga.—This Tuesday's U.S. House special election in Georgia has turned into a defining clash between the two political parties, with both sides targeting a new cadre of potential swing voters: Republicans uneasy with the rise of President Donald Trump.
In the final days before the election, Democrat Jon Ossoff is offering a middle-of-the-road message that sets a different tone from his campaign's inaugural promise to "make Trump furious."
GOP leaders, fearing an upset in this suburban Atlanta district the party has held for decades, are making an urgent appeal to Republicans to support GOP candidate Karen Handel, even if they have their doubts about the president.
"I know some of you out there, some Republicans, may even be turned off by our president," said Sonny Perdue, Mr. Trump's agriculture secretary, at a sweltering get-out-the-vote rally for Ms. Handel on Saturday in an airplane hangar here. "This is a race for the heart and soul for America."
The candidates and outside groups have poured a record $60 million into this district north of Atlanta, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data by Issue One, a bipartisan campaign finance group.


Skirmishing Over Syria
A bipartisan conceit has been that the U.S. can defeat Islamic State by ducking the larger conflict in Syria, and now we're finding out that may not be possible. A U.S. F-18 jet shot down a Syrian bomber on Sunday to protect U.S. allies fighting Islamic State, and on Monday Russia and Iran threatened to target U.S. planes in response.
A U.S. fighter shot down the Syrian SU-22 plane after Syrian aircraft made their second bombing run against Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) allied with the U.S. near Taqba. The regime was clearly testing whether the U.S. would assist its allies on the ground. The U.S. needed to send a deterrent message or Syrian President Bashar Assad will continue to press his offensive across SDF-held territory.
The risk of escalation is real, but this isn't a skirmish the U.S. can easily avoid. Mr. Assad and his allies in Moscow and Tehran know that ISIS's days controlling Raqqa in Syria are numbered. They want to assert control over as much territory as possible in the interim, and that means crushing the SDF.
The Russian threat on Monday to target with anti-aircraft missiles any U.S. aircraft flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria is part of the same intimidation strategy. Russia also suspended a hotline between the two armed forces designed to reduce the risk of a military mistake. Iran, which arms and assists Mr. Assad on the ground, vowed further Syrian regime attacks against SDF, all but daring U.S. planes to respond amid the Russian threat.
The White House and Pentagon reacted with restraint on Monday, calling for a de-escalation and open lines of communication. But if Syria and its allies are determined to escalate, the U.S. will either have to back down or prepare a more concerted effort to protect its allies and now U.S. aircraft.


Saving Chief Wahoo
Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder immediately got the importance of the Supreme Court's "Slants" decision this week. "I am THRILLED." Mr. Snyder said in a written understatement. "Hail to the Redskins."
No, hail to the Supreme Court, which stands in our times as the nation's sturdiest dam against a determined assault on American free speech.
Set aside for a moment the Washington Redskins, and we'll shortly get to the bigger issue of the Cleveland Indians' embattled logo, Chief Wahoo. Several elevated thoughts are in order.
It is not possible to overstate the importance of the Supreme Court's unanimous decision this week to confer free-speech protection on the Slants, an Asian-American rock band. That is because it is also hard to overstate the progressive left's determination to establish, in practice if not in law, limits on America's free-speech traditions.
Ruling against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's determination that the name Slants had violated its "disparagement clause," Justice Samuel Alito's decision for the court was written with the rare clarity of a declarative sentence in the active voice: "This provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend."


He Persisted
Did fake news appear in this column on Thursday? Your humble correspondent wrote that "it's not that voters oppose the Russia investigation; they just don't think it will solve their problems." But now comes a report from The Hill published on Friday:
A majority of voters believe the Russia investigations are damaging to the country and are eager to see Congress shift its focus to healthcare, terrorism, national security, the economy and jobs.
Those are the findings of the latest Harvard-Harris poll, provided exclusively to The Hill, which paint a complicated picture of voters' opinions about the myriad probes that have engulfed the White House.
Sixty-four percent of voters said the investigations into President Trump and Russia are hurting the country. Fifty-six percent of voters said it's time for Congress and the media to move on to other issues, compared to 44 percent who said the focus should stay on Russia.
This column is hoping readers will conclude that Thursday's edition wasn't an example of fake news when it claimed that voters don't oppose a Russia inquiry, but simply a story that may have been overtaken by events. Also, the Harvard study is just one opinion survey and as The Hill notes, "other surveys have found strong support for the special counsel investigating the Russia probe. A Harvard-Harris poll released last month found 75 percent support for former FBI Robert Mueller's investigation."
But let's assume for the moment that the new Harvard study is an accurate reading of current public sentiment. This seems plausible as Democrats increasingly conclude that they must focus more on jobs and the economy in their communications with voters. Partly driving this conclusion is the unhappy experience of Jon Ossoff, who found that Georgia voters cared less about collusion claims than did California donors.


Sarah Palin Sues New York Times, Alleging Defamation in Editorial
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is claiming in a federal lawsuit that the New York Times defamed her when it published an editorial—since corrected—suggesting she helped incite the 2011 assassination attempt against former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan Tuesday, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee says she seeks "to hold The Times accountable for..publishing a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011."
"We have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously," a Times spokeswoman said Tuesday evening.
The Times published the unsigned editorial June 14, hours after an anti-Republican gunman seriously wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) and injured three others at a congressional baseball practice outside Washington, D.C.
Titled "America's Lethal Politics," the paper's editorial cited a "targets" website created by Ms. Palin for the 2010 midterm elections that featured crosshairs over Democratic House districts, including Ms. Gifford's.


Santa Monica Labor Union Wants Transparency Over Hotel Ownership
A member of the Santa Monica, Calif., City Council and workers in the local hotel industry are asking for new ownership disclosure rules as concerns rise over foreign capital coming into the industry.
Chinese firm Anbang Insurance Group Co. purchased Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc. from Blackstone Group LP last year, taking control of Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, the largest hotel in Santa Monica.
Anbang Chairman Wu Xiaohui has been detained by investigators of economic crimes, said people familiar with the matter. Employees at Anbang said the person now in charge is the Communist Party's top representative at Anbang, Chen Ping, according to an earlier report in The Wall Street Journal. Anbang said previously that Mr. Wu has "authorized relevant senior executives" to manage Anbang in his absence.
Anbang didn't respond to requests for comment.
"I'm very concerned about the increasing lack of transparency in hotel ownership, and Anbang is a prime example," said Santa Monica City Councilmember Sue Himmelrich. "Our city works best when we know who we're in business with," she added in a press release. Labor union Unite Here is asking the City of Santa Monica to boost disclosure laws regarding hotel owners in Santa Monica.


Trump Takes Flak From a PR School
Have public-relations professionals joined the anti-Trump "resistance"? The Center for Public Relations at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School would like you to think so. "Over 80 percent of PR professionals polled believe WH spokespeople 'constantly change their views' and 'distort the truth,' " the center declared in a press release last week.
It quoted the center's director, Fred Cook: "It's clear from the results of our survey that the PR industry would prefer to distance itself from the current White House communications team, whose practices are not reflective of the values of the broader industry."
But is it so clear? I heard about the survey while it was still under way, via a tweet from my profession's national association, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA): "New survey from @USCAnnenberg. Do you believe that the White House is damaging the reputation of our industry?"
That struck me as a leading question, from an organization that is usually nonpartisan. I clicked the link to find the online survey. It asked whether White House communications staffers "work hard to explain the policies of the current administration," "purposefully lie," "do their best under the circumstances" and "act like PR professionals." Survey respondents were asked whether they would hire Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and others for their next jobs.
A quick search revealed other tweets and social-media posts from others in the communications field, including the prestigious Arthur W. Page Society, urging public engagement with the survey. Yet the online poll required no validation of PRSA affiliation or other professional credentials. Respondents were merely asked what kind of company they worked for and how long they had been in a PR-related position.


Xi Warns Hong Kong as New Leader Takes Oath
HONG KONG—Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a stern warning to Hong Kong, where a pro-democracy movement has provoked mass protests in recent years, saying challenges to Beijing's authority won't be tolerated.
"Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government..or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line, and is absolutely impermissible," Mr. Xi said in a speech marking the 20th anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule from Britain.
The 64-year-old leader spoke at the end of a three-day visit to Hong Kong, his first as China's president, as the mainland exerts growing influence over a city that has operated with a free-market ethos under a "one country, two systems" arrangement introduced in the 1997 handover. In the past year, mainland authorities have intervened in local elections and moved to block pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators from taking their seats.
The speech was an admonition to the city of seven million people to end an era of political upheaval and embrace its place in broader China. Mr. Xi, who left the city Saturday afternoon, extolled the virtues of Hong Kong's free-market system as a source of growth and a symbol of mainland accommodation and promotion of "global peace."
Mr. Xi lauded the "one country, two systems" model as a success and affirmed China's long-term commitment to it. But he cautioned against the risks of political turmoil.


Notable & Quotable: Joe Scarborough in '20
Brent Budowsky writing at TheHill.com, June 29:
Watching the latest vulgar and sexist outburst of Donald Trump, who temporarily occupies the Oval Office and has now turned his foul mouth against Mika Brzezinski, let me suggest an idea that is offered very seriously. . . .
Joe Scarborough, who is a serious and principled conservative even if he makes too many snide comments about liberals from the upper East Side and Georgetown, should enter the GOP primaries and run against Trump in the 2020 presidential campaigns.
While the thought of former president Trump someday glued to the television watching CNN and MSNBC and then writing angry vulgar tweets about future president Joe Scarborough and his first lady Mika has its own appeal, the idea of a principled conservative replacing by succeeding an unprincipled vulgarian should have even greater appeal to Republicans who will vote in 2020 primaries.


The North Korean Missile Crisis
North Korea continued to defy the protests of world leaders on Tuesday by launching what looks to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The symbolism of launching on America's Independence Day was surely no accident, but the technical feat is more consequential. The speed of North Korea's progress toward threatening the U.S. with a fleet of nuclear-tipped ICBMs requires an urgent response.
Tuesday's missile, dubbed the Hwasong-14, has an estimated range of 6,700 kilometers, which puts Alaska within range. America's lower 48 states may still be out of reach, but the test shows the North has overcome most of the obstacles to a long-range missile. The apparent success will provide more data on the remaining problems, such as a warhead capable of withstanding extremes of temperature and vibration.
One crucial question is whether the new missile is based on the Hwasong-12, an intermediate-range missile successfully tested on May 14. As we wrote at the time, that rocket was apparently a single-stage design and thus a good candidate to become the first stage of an ICBM. The regime has heretofore used engines cobbled together from Russian and Chinese missiles for its ICBM program.
The Hwasong-12 was designed from scratch, and its new engine is more sophisticated than anything the regime had produced. If the North has now attached a second stage, the U.S. will have to advance the estimates of when Los Angeles and Chicago could come under direct threat.
The Trump Administration now has some hard decisions to make as it contemplates its Korea options. More sanctions put the Kim regime under pressure and thus are worth doing, but they can't be relied on to disarm the North in time. Like its allies South Korea and Japan, the U.S. will soon be vulnerable to attack by a regime that has an estimated 20 nuclear warheads as well as chemical and biological weapons. A pre-emptive U.S. military attack can't be ruled out but risks a nuclear counterstrike on South Korea if even one North Korean missile survives.


Slain NYPD Officer Remembered For Her Kindness
Miosotis Familia joined the New York Police Department when she was 36 years old, hoping to help protect the city where she had spent her life.
Ms. Familia had worked for the Red Cross, said a family member and an associate, but she wanted to do more.
"There's always one in the family that wants us to take care of everybody," said Tonya Sanchez, a childhood friend from Washington Heights whose sister married Ms. Familia's brother.
On Wednesday shortly after midnight, Ms. Familia was fatally shot in the head while sitting in a mobile-command post vehicle in the Fordham Heights section of the Bronx.
Shortly afterward she died at a hospital. The mother of three was 48 years old.


France Honors Simone Veil, to Bury Her in Panthéon
PARIS—Holocaust survivors joined France's president and European dignitaries Wednesday at a special memorial ceremony for Simone Veil, who rose from the horrors of Nazi death camps to become president of the European Parliament and one of France's most revered politicians.
Best known in France for spearheading the legalization of abortion, Veil faced down sexist criticism and repeatedly broke barriers for women in politics. She died last week at age 89.
During a national ceremony with military honors Wednesday at the Invalides monument, home to Napoleon's tomb, President Emmanuel Macron announced Veil will be inducted into Paris' Panthéon mausoleum that is the final resting place of dozens of French greats.
European flags around France were lowered to half-staff to honor a woman whose experience at Auschwitz-Birkenau made her a firm believer in European unification.
Macron praised her as inspiring "respect and fascination."


The Conservative 'Resistance' Is Futile
Democrats, in their role as opponents of President Trump, have taken to calling themselves "the resistance." But I was startled a few days ago when a thoughtful, much-admired conservative commentator used the same term on TV—casually, as if "the resistance" was just the obvious term. Everyone is saying it. It's no accident that the left runs American culture. The right is too obsessed with mere mechanics—poll numbers and vote counts—to look up.
"Resistance" is unacceptable in referring to the Trump opposition because, obviously, it suggests the Resistance—against the Nazis in occupied France. Many young people are too ignorant to recognize the term, but that hardly matters. The press uses it constantly. So when a young innocent finally does encounter the genuine French Resistance, he will think, "Aha, just like the resistance to Trump!" And that's all the left wants: a mild but continuous cultural breeze murmuring in every American ear that opposing Trump is noble and glorious. Vive la Résistance!
This abuse of "the resistance" happens everywhere. Many Republicans hate Mr. Trump and love to denounce him—which lets them show their integrity and, sometimes, a less-praiseworthy attribute too.
Many intellectuals think Mr. Trump is vulgar. That includes conservatives. They think he's a peasant and talks like one. Every time he opens his mouth, all they hear is a small-time Queens operator who struck it big but has never had a proper education, and embarrasses the country wherever he goes, whatever he says. It never dawns on them that the president can't stand them any more than they can stand him. Yet they expect him to treat them with respectful courtesy if he ever runs into them—as he should, and on the whole does. Conceivably they should treat him the same way.
Conservatives regret the collapse of authority, dignity and a certain due formality in the way Americans treat each other. They are right to complain when any president diminishes his office. Mr. Trump ought to think more seriously about what he owes the great men among his predecessors, and the office itself. But it's not clear that commentators make things any better when they treat the president himself like a third-rate clown.


When Donald Met Vlad
By the time President Trump sat down in Hamburg, Germany with Russia's Vladimir Putin, the media hype had built the meeting into virtually the second coming of the Reykjavik Summit. The agreement that fell out of the Hamburg bilateral was the announcement of a cease-fire in southwestern Syria.
Any cessation of hostilities in Syria is welcome, and we can hope it will become the basis for similar agreements on the country's more complex northern war fronts. But that would require Mr. Putin to abandon his grand strategy for re-establishing Russian influence across the Middle East, in partnership with Iran and Syria. That would take a real summit and more planning than went into the Hamburg sit-down.
Messrs. Trump and Putin brought only their foreign ministers into the meeting, suggesting that the primary goal here was to take each other's measure. Both men famously pride themselves in their ability to size up adversaries—Mr. Trump as a negotiator of real-estate deals and Mr. Putin as a former KGB recruiter of foreign agents.
The American and Russian sides also bring distinctly different intentions into meetings like this one. For the American side, prodded by an insistent media narrative, the goal is to discover areas of possible "cooperation." In Mr. Putin's world, such a meeting has one purpose: to discover if he will be able to press Russian interests forward without significant pushback from the U.S. President.
Mr. Putin concluded that Barack Obama would pose minimal resistance, and so he seized Crimea, invaded eastern Ukraine and adopted Syria's Bashar Assad. He's still in all three places.


Judge's Expected Retirement Will Let Trump Appoint Conservative to Powerful Circuit
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump will soon have the ability to start remaking Washington's second-most powerful court, with the expected retirement of Judge Janice Rogers Brown from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Judge Brown, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, has notified officials that she is stepping down, according to a person familiar with the matter. Judge Brown, 68 years old, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
It is common for federal judges to time their retirements when a president of the party who appointed them is in office. That increases the odds of a like-minded successor.
Moreover, retired federal judges frequently assume "senior status," which allows them to maintain their salaries and continue hearing cases, with some limitations.
Judge Brown has been among the most conservative voices on the D.C. Circuit, which hears many cases involving federal regulatory authority, the powers of the executive and legislative branches, and special matters such as appeals from Guantanamo Bay detainees.


Effectiveness of New U.N. Antinuclear Treaty Debated
UNITED NATIONS—Advocates say a treaty adopted by the United Nations on Friday represents the first step toward a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons.
But the U.S., other nuclear powers and their allies said the move would have no effect on weapons and called for greater efforts to halt proliferation and pursue disarmament efforts.
Two-thirds of United Nations' member states—122 countries—adopted the treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons. The 10-page document follows the framework of similar treaties that ban the use of chemical and biological weapons, signed in 1972 and 1993 respectively.
"The treaty represents an important step and contribution towards the common aspiration of a world without nuclear weapons," U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Friday.
The world's nine nuclear powers and all but one member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization didn't attend the vote session at the General Assembly. Netherlands, the only NATO member that participated, voted no. Singapore abstained. Iran, which ended its controversial nuclear program after a deal with world powers, voted in favor of the treaty.


Pakistan Prime Minister Sharif Says He Won't Resign
ISLAMABAD—Pakistan's prime minister rejected calls to resign and will continue to fight allegations of corruption, aides said Monday, after a criminal investigation found that he and his children were living beyond their means.
Lawyers said the Supreme Court could disqualify the prime minister from office now, but is more likely to send the case to a trial court on corruption charges. If convicted, that would be grounds for disqualification, or removal from office, according to lawyers. The Supreme Court will hold further hearings next week ahead of deciding what to do.
The investigation report's contents, presented to the Supreme Court on Monday, were rejected by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's aides as "not based on any evidence." Amid media reports about the probe's conclusions, the aides confirmed the authenticity of the four-page conclusion document from the investigation into the finances of the Pakistani leader and his children. The probe found Mr. Sharif and his children weren't "able to justify assets and the means of income."
"This is a witch hunt, this isn't justice," said Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif. "There should be no doubt: we are going to fight this legal battle and demolish every allegation one by one."
The legal and political battle will prolong Pakistan's political crisis, distracting attention from other pressing issues, including the country's fight against terrorism, analysts said. Opposition leader Imran Khan, who renewed his call for the prime minister's resignation, said the process will strengthen democracy in Pakistan by making rulers accountable.


Why Europeans Oppose the Russia Sanctions Bill
The U.S. Senate was almost unanimous—98-2—when it passed a bill updating and expanding the sanctions regime against Russia. Congress has every right to make a strong statement on Russia's alleged interference in last year's presidential election. But this bill, which is awaiting a vote in the House, will not achieve its objectives and will instead cause new problems. Unless it undergoes significant revision, it would compromise European energy security and damage U.S. relations with Europe. The beneficiary of such an outcome would be Russia.
At risk is the joint stance the U.S. and Europe have maintained against Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Every sanctions measure was assessed by American and European partners before enactment. Europe and the U.S. moved hand in hand to ensure that neither would exploit markets or business opportunities previously held by the other. This trans-Atlantic approach is now jeopardized by the Senate's desire to impose additional sanctions unilaterally, without consultation and against the explicit will of the European Commission and key U.S. allies including Germany, France and Italy.
Even worse, the bill's language suggests that it aims to advance U.S. commercial interests at Europe's expense. Section 257 prioritizes "the export of United States energy resources to create American jobs"—which sounds to Europeans like an unfriendly political attempt to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
One target of the bill is the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, involving both Russian and European companies. There are good arguments why Europe should diversify its gas supply, but the dependency fears around NS2 are exaggerated. Europe has taken decisive measures to boost supply security: constructing additional interconnectors and LNG terminals, employing reverse flow capabilities, and eliminating restrictive clauses on ultimate destinations. These measures make it difficult for Russia even to consider using energy as a weapon against Europe.
There is a vibrant debate in Europe about NS2 and the best way forward. Strong arguments, both pro and con, are being exchanged. The Polish and Ukrainian governments are concerned that the pipeline will compete against Russian gas flowing through pipelines in their territories. Some, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, propose to welcome all additional sources and supply routes of energy to Europe, including American LNG. Ideally, the market would decide the best course.


America's Summer Labor Shortage
Employers from Cape Cod bed-and-breakfasts to Alaskan fisheries have been begging the Trump Administration for more seasonal guest-worker visas. Summer is nearly half over, and on Monday the Department of Homeland Security finally agreed to issue 15,000 additional H-2B visas.
The H-2B visa program covers a myriad of industries that rely on seasonal labor including seafood, construction, skiing, tourism and landscaping. These jobs typically pay well, though they can be grueling and their temporary nature deters native-born Americans from applying. Some summer jobs in tourism used to be filled by teens who now spend their summers studying or volunteering.
Foreign workers have become even more crucial as labor markets have tightened amid near record low unemployment in many states. Unemployment is a mere 2.3% in Colorado, 2.7% in Hawaii and 3.2% in Maine. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 755,000 job openings in food services and accommodations in May, up 12% from a year ago.
H-2B visas are capped annually at 66,000, and the labor shortage was exacerbated after Congress last year refused to extend a provision in the law that allowed foreigners who had previously worked on H-2Bs to count toward the limit. But the omnibus budget that Congress passed in May let Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly increase the number of visas in consultation with Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.
While the 15,000 additional visas will no doubt be welcomed by employers, they won't satisfy the growing demand for labor. More than 120,000 seasonal visas were requested this year, so tens of thousands of summer positions in hotels, fisheries and elsewhere will go unfilled. Businesses in disparate industries will be competing for too few foreign workers. And because the government usually requires between 30 to 60 days to process visas, workers may not arrive in time to benefit some employers. The result will be reduced economic output and perhaps shorter vacations for U.S. workers.


Trump, Putin Held Second, Private Talk at Dinner for G-20
WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a second, previously undisclosed talk on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month, a White House official said Tuesday.
The conversation took place on the same day that the two leaders met earlier for more than two hours in what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called an "extraordinarily important meeting."
The White House disclosed the conversation after it was reported by Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk advisory group. He wrote about the meeting in a company newsletter and spoke about it in a television interview Tuesday.
The two leaders spoke during a state dinner for the world leaders and their spouses.
The White House official said Mr. Trump spoke with many leaders during the dinner and said the president "spoke briefly" with Mr. Putin, who was seated next to first lady Melania Trump, toward the end of the evening.


Judging Poland's Democracy
Good news from Poland: Democracy lives despite an uproar over the judiciary. That's something to note for critics who see a threat to European values in the current ruckus in Warsaw.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has embroiled itself in efforts to rein in judges since winning 2015's election. Its latest gambit is to try to fire all the Supreme Court justices, giving the Justice Minister authority to rehire its favorites. PiS also last week passed a law giving Parliament final say over membership of the National Judiciary Council (KRS), the independent body that nominates judges.
PiS says unaccountable judges thwart the will of voters by nixing laws passed by Parliament—including PiS initiatives the last time the party held power from 2005 to 2007. That's debatable, but it doesn't help that the departing Civic Platform leadership in 2015 tried to rush a series of lame-duck appointments to the Supreme Court, handing PiS an early opportunity to stir public frustration with the judiciary.
Such debates are as old as the hills—judicial power, appointments and tenure preoccupied America's Founders—and some perspective would help. Foreign activists and the European Commission in Brussels fret that PiS is a threat to democracy. They're right that the proposals are heavy-handed. Yet there's no perfect method for balancing judicial independence and democratic sovereignty. Brussels doesn't have a democratic mandate to impose its view, which leans more toward judicial independence than democratic oversight.
More important are the protests from thousands of Poles in Warsaw telling their government that PiS's court plans don't represent the balance those voters want. The uproar has caused President Andrzej Duda, a former PiS politician whose office is usually ceremonial, to threaten to veto the Judiciary Council law.


EU Weighs Taking Action Against Poland
BRUSSELS—The European Union is threatening to deploy its most severe punishment on a member state for the first time, highlighting what it sees as Poland's grave departure from the bloc's core tenets.
With Polish President Andrzej Duda poised to sign legislation into law that expands government control on the judiciary, Brussels may ask EU governments to formally warn Poland to reverse course, under provisions of Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty that aim to protect the rule of law and other democratic values. If Warsaw persists, EU governments could even impose sanctions on Poland up to suspending its voting rights.
"It should come as no surprise to anyone that given the latest developments, we are coming very close to triggering Article 7," said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
The provision for such action first entered EU treaties as the bloc considered expanding eastward after the Soviet Union's collapse, with an eye to safeguarding its democratic principles. It was meant to fill a gap that results from the wide scope Brussels allows national governments over designing their democratic order.
If the commission triggers Article 7, EU governments would have to muster the necessary four-fifths majority of states and the European Parliament's consent to warn Warsaw. Sanctions would be harder to introduce, requiring unanimity among the 27 members other than Poland. That is likely impossible given Hungary's support for Warsaw and its disagreement with Brussels over what a European democracy should look like.


Hawaii Adopts Emergency Plan for North Korea Missile Attack
Hawaiian officials are adopting the motto of better safe than sorry when it comes to the threat of a nuclear weapons attack.
The state is potentially on the front-line to aggression from North Korea. On Friday, officials with the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency rolled out a public awareness campaign aimed at educating people on how to respond to an attack.
For some, the campaign may recall the "duck and cover" drills of the 1950s in various locations across the U.S. following the then Soviet Union's development of a nuclear arsenal. The Hawaii campaign will include public service announcements and steps that can be taken at short notice, including evacuation drills for school students.
The threat of retaliation from the U.S. means a nuclear attack by the North Korea regime remains very low. Vern Miyagi, administrator of the state emergency agency, said it is his responsibility to prepare for all potential danger to the public. "We don't know the exact capabilities or intentions of the North Korean government, but there is clear evidence that it is trying to develop ballistic missiles that could conceivably one day reach our state," he said.
North Korea could develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile by taking a variety of different routes, experts have told The Wall Street Journal. The regime has twice launched a satellite from a three-stage ballistic rocket with sufficient power to reach the West Coast of the U.S. and could form the basis for such a missile.


Massachusetts State Court Rules Against Immigration Detention Policy
The highest court in Massachusetts dealt a fresh legal blow Monday to the Trump administration's effort to compel local authorities to assist in its crackdown against illegal immigration.
The state's Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Massachusetts court officials can't hold people in jail simply because the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency requests it.
ICE routinely issues these requests, called detainers, to local officials asking that they hold for up to 48 hours people who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The Trump administration has labeled those that don't comply "sanctuary" jurisdictions and is looking for ways to compel cooperation.
While the decision applies only to Massachusetts, several federal appellate courts have issued similar rulings undercutting ICE's authority. In addition, a federal court has blocked parts of a Trump executive order aimed at punishing sanctuary cities.
Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley didn't address the decision directly in a statement, but he urged cities to cooperate with detainees to protect public safety.


The Number of Defendants Held in N.J. Jails Drops
The number of defendants in New Jersey jails who are awaiting trial has decreased more than 20% since January, when the state's overhaul of its bail policy went into effect.
Data released Tuesday by New Jersey's court system show the impact of changes designed to largely eliminate money bail, which is used as a deposit to ensure that a defendant returns to court.
Previously, bail was set for many defendants and typically only those who couldn't afford to pay ended up being held in jail. Now, state officials say, defendants are held based on factors such as risk to public safety or likelihood to flee.
Of 21,763 defendants statewide who appeared in court during the first six months of this year, about 14% were held in jail. Nearly 10% were released without conditions, and 73% were released with mandatory monitoring, which can include drug and alcohol screening or house arrest.
The percentage of defendants held in jail varied greatly by county. Atlantic County, in southern New Jersey, detained 28% of its pretrial defendants. Bergen County, in the northeastern part of the state, detained 6%.


How Long Can the Trump Tumult Go On?
Even for this dramatic administration, the past seven days have been extraordinary. Start a week ago Wednesday, when President Trump said Attorney General Jeff Sessions "should have never recused himself" from the investigation of Russian electoral meddling, calling the recusal "very unfair." These comments were followed by the unlikely rumor that the Trump legal team would go after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's staff, along with more-plausible suggestions that the president might fire Mr. Mueller.
On Friday, Mr. Trump appointed New York financier Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director, prompting press secretary Sean Spicer to resign. This all sparked speculation about the standing of chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon, both of whom allegedly opposed hiring Mr. Scaramucci.
Then on Monday, a Senate panel interviewed White House senior adviser Jared Kushner about a July 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. That meeting was organized by Donald Trump Jr., who had received an email saying Russian officials possessed "documents and information that would incriminate Hillary." Young Mr. Trump was told this "very high level and sensitive information" was "part of Russia and its government's support" for his father.
The following day, the president renewed his attacks on his attorney general, tweeting that Mr. Sessions had taken "a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!" Later, during a Rose Garden presser, Mr. Trump lamented that he was "very disappointed in Jeff Sessions."
During this swirl of events, Team Trump portrayed Mr. Scaramucci's appointment as a major reset, saying the president was his administration's best communicator and that he would benefit from delivering more of his message directly. But this is a misdiagnosis of what ails the administration's public relations. The president's job-performance rating has dropped from an even 44% approval and disapproval on Jan. 27 to 40% approval and 55% disapproval this Wednesday, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Mr. Trump's ratings are sliding because of his own messages and actions, not those of his subordinates.


Cancer Treatment to Keep McCain Out of Senate Until September
Sen. John McCain will be out of the Senate until September undergoing treatment for brain cancer, his office said Friday.
Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called a glioblastoma earlier this month. Doctors removed a blood clot from above his left eye on July 14 and tested the tissue, discovering the cancer.
On Monday, the senator is set to start a "standard postsurgical regimen of targeted radiation and chemotherapy," according to a statement from his spokeswoman.
A glioblastoma is an aggressive type of tumor that can be difficult to treat and a cure often isn't possible, according to the Mayo Clinic. Treatments may slow the progression of the cancer and reduce symptoms.
Mr. McCain had been in Arizona recuperating after surgery and flew to Washington this week to cast deciding votes on the Senate's health-care bill. His vote was needed on Tuesday to open debate on the legislation. He voted against the bill early Friday, effectively sinking it along with two other Republicans.


U.S. Presses China on North Korea Threat
Trump administration officials urged China and other nations to band together to confront North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic-missile ambitions, with Vice President Mike Pence declaring "all options are on the table" to rein in Pyongyang.
"The continued provocations by the rogue regime in North Korea are unacceptable and the United States of America is going to continue to marshal the support of nations across the region and across the world to further isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically," Mr. Pence told reporters traveling with him in Estonia on Sunday, two days after North Korea's second intercontinental ballistic-missile test. "We believe China should do more."
Speaking at a trade briefing on Monday, China's vice minister of commerce, Qian Keming, said the U.S. and China should separate issues over trade from those over North Korea's missile test, adding that Beijing is willing to work with the U.S. to boost bilateral trade.
Mr. Qian didn't directly address North Korea's latest missile test, but said China remains committed to ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley rejected calls for an emergency session of the Security Council, saying "the time for talk is over" and that a further Security Council resolution that doesn't "significantly increase the international pressure" on North Korea would be "worse than nothing."


Nashville Mayor's Son Found Dead in Apparent Drug Overdose
The 22-year-old son of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry was found dead on Saturday night in Denver of an apparent drug overdose, Ms. Barry's office said in a statement.
"Early this morning, we received news that no parents should ever have to hear," Ms. Barry and her husband Bruce said in a statement.
"Our son Max suffered from an overdose and passed away. We cannot begin to describe the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing our only child. Our son was a kind soul full of life and love for his family and friends."
Max Barry had recently graduated in June from the University of Puget Sound, the statement said.


Britain's Brexit Blunders
Theresa May's government is deeply divided over Brexit, but one trend is emerging: Her ministers seem determined to get their negotiating priorities backward. Witness a growing resistance to compromise with the European Union when compromise would be best for Britain, coupled with unilateral policy disarmament on issues where Britain should carve out a new path.
An example of the latter comes via Chancellor Philip Hammond's promise that Britain won't cut taxes and regulations to compete with the EU. He told Le Monde this week that Britain will "remain a country with a social, economic and cultural model that is recognizably European," including a tax take as a percentage of GDP around the European average.
This is self-destructive. Brexit is supposed to allow Britain to shed onerous taxes and cumbersome regulations. The U.K. will have to do both to attract investment despite the costs of probable new trade barriers with the EU and the weaker pound. Mr. Hammond's unilateral economic disarmament is a mistake for the ages.
Meanwhile, members of the cabinet are holding firm on their determination to block immigration from the EU. A spokesman for Mrs. May on Monday promised free movement of people would not "continue as it is now" after Brexit. Yet the economy can't grow without immigrant labor, given the skills shortages in the tight pre-Brexit labor market. Intransigence on immigration will also make it harder for London to negotiate a more open trade deal with the EU.
June's election fiasco has dimmed Mrs. May's enthusiasm for standing up to destructive factions within her own party, especially on migration. If she doesn't start leading in a different direction, the future looks bleaker for her and Britain after Brexit.


Venezuelan Officials Tampered With Election, Voting-Software Firm Says
CARACAS—Venezuelan authorities tampered with votes during an election this week to pick a 550-member body to rewrite the country's constitution, said the London-based company that provided voting software and electronic machines for the poll.
"We are convinced this is the first time there has been fraud in any election that we have been involved with," Mark Malloch-Brown, chairman of Smartmatic, said in an interview on Wednesday. He spoke after the company disclosed that officials doctored more than one million of the 8.1 million votes the government said were cast.
The revelations from Smartmatic, which provides voting software to governments worldwide, cast further doubt over the legitimacy of Sunday's election of a powerful constituent assembly staffed with loyalists to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The U.S. and many European and Latin American countries condemned that vote as illegitimate and conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation and human rights abuses. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Mr. Maduro and other top officials in recent days.
The government had intended to draw millions to the polls and outflank the opposition, which on July 16 said more than 7.5 million Venezuelans voted to reject the assembly in an unauthorized referendum. The assembly, which was to have convened on Wednesday, has broad powers over every institution in the country, including the opposition-controlled congress.


China's Dissident Chatbots
Beijing's system of internet censorship relies on tens of thousands of workers to remove comments critical of the Communist Party. So what does the average citizen really think of the one-party state? A couple of artificial-intelligence programs run by a Chinese internet company suggest resentment of the country's rulers is running high.
Tencent introduced two "chatbots" in March to provide information in a conversational manner similar to Apple's Siri. The programs were designed to learn how to make conversation by listening to Chinese netizens. Like children, the programs started to repeat what they heard, and that's when the problems began.
Taiwan's Apple Daily newspaper printed screenshots of the chatbots attacking the Communist Party. BabyQ asked one user, "Do you think such corrupt and incapable politics can last a long time?" XiaoBing mocked President Xi Jinping's "Chinese Dream" slogan, saying, "The Chinese dream is a daydream and a nightmare." Its Chinese dream was "to move to America."
Chinese internet users post a variety of opinions, like their counterparts in the rest of the world. The difference is that explicitly antigovernment comments are glimpsed only briefly before they are removed. It seems Tencent forgot to erase the forbidden thoughts from the memory of its chatbots. They effectively became a record of prevailing opinions without the filter of censorship.
That is until BabyQ and XiaoBing were taken down. This week the chatbots were sent off to digital re-education camps, and Tencent says they will return after "improvements."


U.S. Is Overhauling Its Nuclear Arsenal
WASHINGTON—A broad overhaul of the U.S. nuclear arsenal has been under way for half a decade, aiming to replace the planes, missiles and submarines the U.S. military would use to deliver nuclear weapons to enemy targets.
The project, expected to cost as much as $1 trillion over 30 years, took on new relevance on Wednesday amid an exchange of threats between the U.S. and North Korea—and after President Donald Trump touted the nuclear revamp.
"My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. "It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before."
The overhaul of the nuclear program began under the Obama administration, which agreed to undertake the program in 2010 in exchange for Republican ratification of the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia.
The modernization program doesn't increase the size of the warhead arsenal, which already dwarfs that of North Korea.


Arrests at Southern Border Rose in July
Arrests of people caught trying to illegally cross the Mexican border into the U.S. rose in July from a month earlier, the third straight monthly increase, according to federal figures released Tuesday.
U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 18,198 people caught sneaking across the border in July, compared with 16,087 in June.
President Donald Trump has made priorities of border security, including building a wall along the Mexican border, and a crackdown on illegal immigration. He has repeatedly said that under his watch arrests at the border have plummeted, and immigration agents have stepped up efforts to arrest and deport immigrants living in the country illegally.
During Mr. Trump's first few months in office, arrests at the border did drop—11,125 people were detained in April, which the administration said was a record low for a single month. Border agents made 12,197 arrests in March and 18,755 in February.
Border apprehensions have been steadily increasing since May.


Profile Emerges of Man Charged in Charlottesville, Va., Rampage
James Alex Fields Jr., the 20-year-old man arrested and charged for driving a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of demonstrators in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday and killing a 32-year-old woman, was remembered as a quiet student by a school principal and a fellow classmate, but a former teacher said he also espoused white-supremacist views.
Mr. Fields attended high school in northern Kentucky and eventually settled near Toledo, Ohio. Michael Wilson, principal at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Ky., confirmed that Mr. Fields graduated from the school in 2015. He said he could share only limited details for confidentiality reasons.
"From what I remember, he was a quiet and reserved student," Mr. Wilson said in an email. "Our thoughts and prayers are with those in Charlottesville, Virginia. Hatred and violence is never a viable solution to any problem. As educators, we are always using teachable moments and providing guidance to students to create college, career and life ready students to make good and sound choices."
Mr. Fields joined the Army shortly after high school and reported to basic training in August 2015. "He was, however, released from active duty due to a failure to meet training standards in December of 2015," Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, an Army spokeswoman, said in an email. She didn't elaborate on how he failed to meet standards.
"As a result he was never awarded a military occupational skill nor was he assigned to a unit outside of basic training," Lt. Col. Johnson said.


Pence Plays Down Trump Threat on Venezuela
CARTAGENA, Colombia—Vice President Mike Pence tamped down President Donald Trump's threats of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela amid growing regional fears that such comments have strengthened that country's president, Nicolás Maduro.
Mr. Pence spoke Sunday night in neighboring Colombia, two days after Mr. Trump jolted the region by saying he was considering a military operation to resolve a growing political crisis over Mr. Maduro's regime, which the U.S. and Colombia have both characterized as increasingly dictatorial.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, speaking before Mr. Pence at a joint press conference, said he had told the American frankly, as a friend, that such a move shouldn't be considered.
"Every country in Latin America would not favor any form of military intervention," Mr. Santos said. "A transition in the Venezuelan regime toward democracy must be a peaceful transition. It must be hopefully a democratic transition. And it must be done quickly."
Mr. Pence replied that the U.S. was confident that peaceful solutions could be found, and that Mr. Trump's remarks on Friday had merely reflected his resolve to address the situation.


India Train Derails, Killing 23
LUCKNOW, India—Six coaches of a passenger train derailed in northern India on Saturday, killing 23 people and injuring at least 81, officials said.
Two of the coaches into each other, while four others toppled over after going off the track, said Arvind Kumar, a top official in Uttar Pradesh, the state where the derailment occurred.
Neeraj Sharma, a railway spokesman, said the incident took place near the small town of Khatauli.
The cause of the derailment wasn't immediately known, Sharma said.
Railway police and local volunteers helped pull passengers out of the upturned coaches of the Kalinga-Utkal Express, which connects the Hindu holy city of Haridwar with the temple town of Puri, in the eastern state of Orissa.


White House Likely to Name Rep. Bridenstine to be NASA Chief
The White House by early September plans to nominate Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine as head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, tapping a Republican legislator who is a strong proponent of commercial space ventures but has scant management experience, according to people familiar with the details.
A former active-duty U.S. Navy pilot who publicly sought the position and was widely reported to be the front-runner even weeks before President Donald Trump's inauguration, Mr. Bridenstine has been a leader in fashioning legislation boosting manned exploration of the moon, including minerals mining.
Such positions are in line with the views of senior White House officials, these people said, as is his desire to save money—and improve efficiency—by more closely coordinating NASA programs with those at other civilian agencies and the Defense Department. Vice President Mike Pence recently was named to lead a revived White House space council responsible for crafting high-level policies and mediating disagreements among agencies.
A White House spokeswoman said "we have no announcement at this time." A NASA spokeswoman didn't have any comment, and Mr. Bridenstine couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
As an outspoken champion of U.S. supremacy in all aspects of military and civilian space, Mr. Bridenstine is a choice who could help bridge some of the deep policy and philosophical disagreements that initially split the Trump administration. Through the transition and early months in office, there were clashes between a faction emphasizing commercial efforts and other White House advisers focusing on traditional NASA programs favored by longstanding contractors.


U.S., South Korea Brace for North's Fury Over War Games
SEOUL—A new cycle of escalation on the Korean Peninsula looked set to begin this week as the U.S. and South Korea kicked off annual military exercises that have a history of enraging Pyongyang.
The long-planned drills follow weeks of belligerent rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea that stoked fears of a catastrophic outcome. In what many saw as a slight easing of tensions last week, dictator Kim Jong Un said he would hold off for now before deciding whether to carry out a threat, announced days earlier, to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.
The 10-day drills, known as Ulchi Freedom Guardian, will test whether North Korea's apparent easing of its immediate threat to Guam proves durable—or if the de-escalation was really a backdown at all.
U.S. officials have long said the exercises are intended to ensure readiness for a possible North Korean attack. Pyongyang, though, has characterized them as preparation for an invasion.
"They are conducting provocative saber-rattling such as joint air attack drills and combined ballistic-missile drills ..rendering the situation extremely tense," North Korean state media warned last week.


Assad Rejects Cooperation With West
DAMASCUS, Syria—President Bashar al-Assad refused any security cooperation with Western nations or the reopening of their embassies, until they cut ties with opposition and insurgent groups.
Shortly after Mr. Assad gave his speech on Sunday, a shell hit the first international fair in the country since the war began six years ago, killing and wounding several people.
Mr. Assad's defiant comments come at a time when his troops and pro-Iranian militias are gaining ground across the country under the cover of Russian airstrikes. Many countries have ceased calling for him to step down.
Speaking before dozens of Syrian diplomats in Damascus, Mr. Assad praised Russia, Iran, China and Lebanon's Hezbollah for supporting his government during the conflict.
He said Syria would look east when it comes to political, economic and cultural relations.


U.S. Has More Troops in Afghanistan Than Publicly Disclosed
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon maintains more than 12,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, defense officials said, currently about 3,500 more than it publicly acknowledges, a critical factor as military planners weigh how many additional forces to deploy under a new strategy.
The actual number of troops, which hasn't been previously disclosed, reflects the true U.S. force level on the ground in Afghanistan. The Pentagon for many years has kept the actual number of forces deployed to a war zone hidden, choosing to publicly disclose only those deployed for longer periods while not counting those who slip in and out of a war zone on temporary status.
In recent years, when tens of thousands of troops were deployed to places like Afghanistan and Iraq, the difference between the public and the true numbers was largely inconsequential. But in recent years, overall troop numbers began to dwindle and the hidden number became more significant, analysts and military officials acknowledge.
In Afghanistan, there are currently about 8,400 troops that the Pentagon publicly acknowledges it has deployed to Afghanistan. But another 3,500 troops are there on temporary assignment or other status. Other groups of troops, such as special forces and other specialized units, are rarely if ever disclosed, bringing the total number in Afghanistan to above 12,000.
In addition, the Pentagon is expected to send up to another 3,900 troops under the new strategy for Afghanistan, for a total of about 16,000 troops, military officials said.


Ruling Could Lead to Return of Tucson Mexican-American Studies Program
A popular and controversial Mexican-American Studies program in Tucson public schools could be resurrected after a federal judge ruled the program was ended based on an unconstitutional, discriminatory law.
Tucson school district officials halted the program after fierce debate over a 2010 Arizona law that banned public schools from offering courses that "promote the overthrow of the United States government" or "resentment toward a race or class of people."
School systems not in compliance with the law risked losing up to 10% in monthly state aid.
The ruling in the yearslong case was critical of former Arizona state superintendents Tom Horne and John Huppenthal.
Mr. Horne said in a statement Wednesday that the ruling defends a program that "divides students by race and promotes ethnic chauvinism."


President Trump Needs a Special Envoy in Afghanistan
After months of deliberation, President Trump has taken a step in the right direction by renewing America's commitment to Afghanistan. In his speech Monday night, Mr. Trump wisely refrained from specifying troop numbers and deadlines. Crucially, he also demanded Pakistan cease its support of Afghanistan's insurgents, calling out Islamabad's meddling more publicly than previous administrations were willing to do.
Now the administration must demonstrate that same shift in American diplomatic leadership. Given his determination to "win" in Afghanistan, the president needs a dedicated diplomatic A-Team in Kabul and Washington. For too long the civilian side of our mission in Afghanistan has been wanting, not from lack of numbers, expertise or dedication, but from lack of well-defined purpose.
The diverse challenges that America's diplomats in Afghanistan must manage include trade, illicit poppy production and aid-program oversight. But there's also Afghanistan-Pakistan relations to massage, a long and porous border to patch up, and severe political corruption to counteract. All this must be managed in an environment of Russian and Iranian interference. Even if the once beefy nation-building budgets won't materialize this time, the tasks for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul are incredibly challenging.
Most urgently, the president needs to appoint a special envoy, reporting directly to him, who commands his and the international community's full faith and confidence. This person would be tasked with several of the most critical diplomatic and strategic to-dos: pushing for Afghan government reform; aligning U.S. and Afghan policy; coordinating U.S. strategy and implementation among military and civilian agencies and the White House; helping to rebuild the Afghan economy; coordinating America's efforts with Pakistan, India and other regional players; and managing possible peace talks with the Taliban.
Reforming the Afghan government is especially important. The special envoy would be responsible for making it clear to President Ashraf Ghani's administration that without improved governance it will not have the backing of its people and security forces—which the survival of the state depends on.


The Distance Between Two Tragedies
Two cars used as rams.
One, in Charlottesville, Va., was driven by a neo-Nazi into a crowd of antiracist counterprotesters.
The other, driven by a Moroccan-born radical Islamist, careened blindly around Barcelona, killing 15 and injuring 126.
Excluding the similar modus operandi and the fresh proof that all forms of fascism eventually resemble one another, the two events differ in nearly every respect.
In Charlottesville, there were not two "sides," as Donald Trump claimed, but rather two opposing camps, two visions of society and the world.


Trump Pardons Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump Friday granted a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who was convicted last month of disobeying a federal court order to halt immigration raids.
Mr. Trump hinted on Tuesday night in a rally in Phoenix that a pardon could be forthcoming.
Mr. Arpaio generated a national reputation for his rigid approach to criminal justice, including efforts to combat illegal immigration. He was convicted of violating a 2011 court order to halt immigration raids.
In announcing the pardon, the White House cited Mr. Arpaio's long stints in law enforcement and the military, which it said "exemplify selfless public service."
Mr. Arpaio has been criticized by advocates for civil liberties for his efforts to combat illegal immigration. Some in Arizona called his policies racist and unduly harsh to minorities and the poor, and staunchly opposed any effort to grant him a pardon.


Supermarket Heiress Believes Manhattan GOP Can Win Again
Andrea Catsimatidis has a bold idea for Manhattan Republicans: win elections.
"In 1993, (former Mayor Rudolph) Giuliani proved a Republican can be competitive in an overwhelmingly Democratic city," Ms. Catsimatidis told donors and activists at a meet-and-greet last week. "We can be victorious again."
Ms. Catsimatidis, an executive at her father John Catsimatidis' multibillion-dollar company Red Apple Group, is the front-runner to become the new chair of the Manhattan Republican Committee, offering a fresh perspective to a club that has struggled locally despite the party's national gains.
While the national GOP has never counted on liberal Manhattan to help it gain power, the island holds a symbolic significance and serves as a fundraising stop for both parties.
"It's the most important county in the country, no matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican," said Mr. Catsimatidis, a donor to the Manhattan GOP who ran for mayor in 2013. "You come to Manhattan to stake your flag."


Trump's Transgender Ban Challenged by Civil-Liberties Lawsuits
WASHINGTON—Civil-liberties groups on Monday filed two lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's ban on transgender service members serving in the military, arguing that the prohibitions are unconstitutional.
The suits state the ban violates rights to due process of service members and those who want to join the military. One of the two lawsuits said the ban also violated free-speech protections.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland filed its suit in Baltimore on behalf of six currently serving transgender service members. Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN filed a separate suit Monday in Seattle on behalf of a currently serving transgender service member, two transgender people who wish to serve, including a male high-school student, and two advocacy groups, the Human Rights Campaign and the Gender Justice League.
Both lawsuits list President Trump and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis among the defendants. The service members listed in the ACLU suit informed the military that they were transgender after President Barack Obama last year lifted a longstanding ban with an "open service" order.
"Without input from the Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff, and without any deliberative process, President Trump cast aside the rigorous, evidence-based policy of the open service directive, and replaced it with discredited myths and stereotypes, uninformed speculation, and animus against people who are transgender," the ACLU lawsuit states.


Trump Administration Plans Restrictions on Reverse Mortgages
The Trump administration is planning to raise premiums and place tighter loan limits on some borrowers in a mortgage program that helps seniors supplement their incomes.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday announced the changes in a letter to lenders to the so-called reverse-mortgage program, which allows seniors to take out a loan against the value of their home. The Trump administration feels the changes are necessary to put the program, which is backstopped by taxpayers, on a sounder financial footing.
"Given the losses we're seeing in the [reverse mortgage] program, we have a responsibility to make changes that balance our mission with our responsibility to protect taxpayers," HUD Secretary Ben Carson saidthrough a spokesman.
The modifications won't apply to borrowers with existing mortgages, but will affect those who take out new loans. Some 650,000 borrowers have outstanding reverse loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of HUD.
Most new borrowers will pay bigger premiums upfront but lower ones over the life of the loan, lessening the risk to taxpayers if seniors live longer than predicted. Borrowers will now pay 2% of the amount of the home's value upfront and 0.5% annually over the course of the loan.


Misusing U.S. Sanctions Will Sap Their Power
Since taking office President Trump has not hesitated to threaten or implement sanctions against countries like Venezuela and North Korea. Sanctions are useful tools, but Mr. Trump and bipartisan majorities in Congress run the risk of making them less effective.
The U.S. economy's size is not the primary reason its sanctions are so powerful: Countries without a significant trade relationship with the U.S. can still be severely damaged by bilateral sanctions. Though the European Union's gross domestic product almost matches America's, EU sanctions are much less devastating. This influence derives from America's central position in international finance—particularly its control over the invisible plumbing that allows money to move around the world.
Recognizing how much of their work touches the U.S., major foreign banks will often go so far as to treat themselves as "U.S. persons" for legal and regulatory purposes. Countries or entities subject to U.S. sanctions thus have a very difficult time with even simple banking transactions, which is catastrophic for trade.
Yet America's dominant place in international banking, like its position in the broader international system, can be lost. The international financial plumbing can be changed with the investment of time and resources by banks, governments and regulators. So far there have not been sufficient incentives to make those changes, but governments and banks will reconsider if the U.S. abuses its position.
Policy makers and regulators in the U.S. have long been sensitive to this risk. They have taken it into account in the application of new sanctions and have worked closely with foreign banks to ensure they're doing permissible business—even business barred to their American competitors. For example, outreach surrounding the Iran deal was designed to assure foreign businesses and regulators that remaining U.S. sanctions were tailored and not a back door to enforcing the sanctions lifted by the deal. Thanks to these efforts, major foreign banks working with Iran have largely chosen to work with U.S. officials and stay in careful compliance.


Think Tank Fires Scholar Who Praised Fine Against Google
WASHINGTON—A Washington think tank backed by Google Inc. and parent Alphabet Inc.'s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, has fired a prominent scholar who praised the $2.7 billion fine recently issued by European regulators against Google for antitrust violations.
Anne-Marie Slaughter, the chief executive of the New America Foundation, said in a statement Wednesday that she fired the scholar, Barry Lynn, because his "repeated refusal to adhere to New America's standards of openness and institutional collegiality meant that we could no longer work together." She said the firing was unrelated to his June criticism of Google.
Mr. Lynn said he was given two months to leave the foundation in late June, a few days after his Open Markets initiative issued a statement applauding the European Commission for taking action against Google. "Google's market power is one of the most critical challenges for competition policymakers in the world today," Mr. Lynn wrote in a statement June 27.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Mr. Lynn said that a few hours after he published the June statement, Ms. Slaughter called him and said: "I just got off the phone with Eric Schmidt and he is pulling all of his money."
The New America Foundation didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Lynn's recollection of the call. In its statement, New America said it is "absolutely false" that Google lobbied New America to expel the Open Markets program because of its statement praising the European Commission's antitrust action.


Notable & Quotable: Pelosi Condemns Antifa
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, in an Aug. 29 statement:
Our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public, no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts. The violent actions of people calling themselves antifa in Berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation, and the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted.
In California, as across all of our great nation, we have deep reverence for the Constitutional right to peaceful dissent and free speech. Non-violence is fundamental to that right. Let us use this sad event to reaffirm that we must never fight hate with hate, and to remember the values of peace, openness and justice that represent the best of America.


How the FCC Redefined the Internet
The Federal Communications Commission received more than 21 million comments—including many from actual humans—on its plan to reconsider the Obama administration's internet regulations. Most advocates on both sides voice indignant, moralistic conclusions about the plight of innovation, the future of the internet, and the fate of the world if they don't get their way.
But for the FCC, the question is a semantic one: Is broadband internet an "information service," as concluded repeatedly over two decades by Democratic and Republican commissioners, or a "telecommunications service" as a partisan majority decreed two years ago?
This is a distinction with a profound legal difference under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Telecommunications services are subject to the same restrictions and government controls that applied to the old Bell monopoly starting in the 1930s. Information services have far more freedom to compete and innovate. The real-world effects of this heavy vs. light regulation are dramatic, and they turn on the question of how consumers use broadband internet.
In response to the FCC's inquiries, the Internet Innovation Alliance, of which I am co-chairman, commissioned a study by CivicScience, an online market-research and data-analysis firm, sampling more than 10,000 U.S. adults. The survey asked what consumers "regularly or occasionally" do online. The results show clearly that most consumers use the internet to get information.
The survey found that 72% of U.S. adults frequently read or watch news, sports or other content online. Sixty-one percent use search engines; 52% purchase items online, and 48% check or post on social media. Smaller percentages store photos, grocery lists and other items. That broadband internet access that enables these activities is precisely what makes broadband an "information service" under the statute. It is impossible to make use of popular video-rich information applications on today's internet using old-fashioned dial-up access because of the need for higher speeds and lower latency.


Electromagnetic Pulse: North Korea's Latest Threat Against U.S.
North Korea's threats against the U.S. now include a tactic long discussed by some experts: an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, triggered by a nuclear weapon that would aim to shut down the U.S. electricity grid.
North Korea's state news agency made a rare reference to the tactic in a Sunday morning release in which the country said it was able to load a hydrogen bomb onto a long-range missile. The bomb, North Korea said, "is a multifunctional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP attack."
The idea of an EMP attack is to detonate a nuclear weapon tens or hundreds of miles above the earth with the aim of knocking out power in much of the U.S. Unlike the U.S. atomic bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, such a weapon wouldn't directly destroy buildings or kill people. Instead, electromagnetic waves from the nuclear explosion would generate pulses to overwhelm the electric grid and electronic devices in the same way a lightning surge can destroy equipment.
In a worst-case scenario, the outages could last for months, indirectly costing many lives, since hospitals would be without power, emergency services couldn't function normally, and people could run short of food and water.
Warnings about the threat have percolated for many years, including in a 2008 report commissioned by Congress that warned an EMP attack could bring "widespread and long lasting disruption and damage to the critical infrastructures that underpin the fabric of U.S. society."


Another Top Court Rules Against Guatemalan President Morales
MEXICO CITY—Guatemala's Supreme Court on Monday approved a petition from the country's attorney general's office to strip immunity from President Jimmy Morales, bringing the leader one step closer to a potential trial for alleged election finance violations.
The motion from prosecutors will now go to the country's Congress, where it requires a two-thirds vote to allow the president to be prosecuted. Congress must vote on installing a commission to begin investigating the charges by early next week.
The court's 11-2 vote also approved stripping the immunity of officials from the country's two leading political parties, who also stand accused of illicit campaign funding. Mr. Morales and the other accused politicians say they are innocent.
"I have always defended the rule of law, judicial norms and the independence of powers," Mr. Morales said in a statement after Monday's ruling.
The ruling marks the latest chapter in a gathering political crisis fueled by investigations of Mr. Morales's campaign and fraud charges against members of his family. The probes are being made by Guatemalan prosecutors with the aid of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or Cicig.


Pope Francis Arrives in Colombia
BOGOTÁ, Colombia—Pope Francis arrived Wednesday here in one of Latin America's most Catholic nations to help its people mend relations after a long guerrilla conflict and show support for a peace process that led the FARC rebel group to disarm and morph into a political party.
The Pope arrived late in the afternoon after a flight from Rome and was greeted by President Juan Manuel Santos, First Lady Maria Rodriguez and the apostolic nuncio to Colombia, Ettore Balestrero, at the air base adjacent to Bogota's international airport. Upon descending from the plane, Francis received a porcelain white dove, the symbol of Colombia's peace initiative.
An estimated 80% of Colombia's 48 million people are Catholic, and many of them were clearly thrilled to have the Argentine-born pontiff visit their country in his fifth papal trip to Latin America. Though the end of Colombia's conflict with the FARC is a clear theme in his visit, for many Catholics the visit was simply a chance to hear and see a charismatic pope with whom many here feel a special bond.
Sandra Ochoa took a 10-hour car trip with two of her children, her husband and other relatives. They plan to line the streets of this city of 8 million to get a glimpse of the pontiff, as well as attend the mass he celebrates Thursday afternoon in the capital's biggest park.
"I'm a believer, very Catholic and I go to church every Sunday," she said. "For us, it will be lovely to hear him talk and get the chance to listen to him. He's very special, and he's precise in his words. He has the ability to manifest his thoughts."


Group of First Responders Sue Arkema Over Chemical Plant Fire
HOUSTON—A group of seven first responders is suing Arkema, Inc. for $1 million, alleging they suffered "serious bodily injuries" last week from a release of toxic chemicals during a series of explosions at the company's plant in Crosby, Texas, roughly 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston.
Containers of chemicals, which are unstable if not kept refrigerated, started igniting on Aug. 31 after power outages caused by Hurricane Harvey cut off cooling systems.
The first responders were manning the perimeter of a 1.5-mile evacuation zone imposed two days before the explosions, but after the blasts occurred, the lawsuit alleges no one from Arkema alerted the first responders.
"One by one, the police officers and first responders began to fall ill in the middle of the road," according to the lawsuit. "The scene was nothing less than chaos. Police officers were doubled over vomiting, unable to breathe. Medical personnel, in their attempts to provide assistance to the officers, became overwhelmed and they too began to vomit and gasp for air."
In a statement Thursday, Arkema Inc. said the company will fight the litigation in court, and its employees "did everything they could to protect the public" in a dangerous situation.

"We reject any suggestion that we failed to warn of the danger of breathing the smoke from the fires at our site, or that we ever misled anyone," Arkema said. "We will vigorously defend a lawsuit that we believe is gravely mistaken."
On Monday, the company said the Crosby Fire Department lifted a 1.5-mile evacuation zone around the plant, allowing hundreds of neighbors to return to their homes.
The explosions have raised concerns about long-term environmental damage to the Houston area, where floodwaters also have inundated at least five toxic-waste Superfund sites.


Trump Won't Rule Out Military Action on North Korea
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump refused to rule out military action against North Korea on Thursday, but he stopped short of answering a reporter's question as to whether he would tolerate a nuclearized North Korean state if the threat were contained.
"North Korea is behaving badly and it's got to stop," Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference.
Continuing several months of rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang's accelerating pace of weapons tests, the president told reporters that he would prefer a diplomatic solution to the prolonged impasse. Mr. Trump also noted that years of talks have done little to rein in North Korea.
"Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable," Mr. Trump said when asked about a military confrontation. "But it's something that certainly could happen." The president said if the U.S. is compelled to use military force, "it would be a very sad day for North Korea."
He said his administration is spending more on military hardware. "Each day, new equipment is delivered; new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world—the best anywhere in the world, by far," Mr. Trump said.


A Costly Vacancy at State
Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro announced in May that he planned to draft a new constitution and shut down the opposition-controlled National Assembly. His opponents in Washington and South Florida lobbied the Trump administration to pressure the regime to withdraw its proposal by banning Venezuelan oil imports.
The White House instead issued sanctions against 13 high-ranking regime officials in the last week of July. On July 30 Maduro went ahead with the rigged elections for his handpicked "constituent assembly," and then closed down the legitimate legislature de facto, thereby putting the finishing touches on his Castro-style one-party state.
American hawks and Venezuelan expats say that the outcome would have been different if the Trump administration had leaned harder on the regime. And that the White House would have done so if not for the influence of the State Department's under secretary of state for political affairs, Thomas Shannon Jr., a career diplomat they accuse of being soft on Caracas.
This narrative is unfortunate, and not only because it may be unfair to Mr. Shannon. It is far from certain how the regime would have responded to an oil-import ban. Some pro-democracy advocates in Venezuela warned that it would starve the nation. More important, the blame-Shannon line ignores Mr. Trump's obligation to exercise leadership consistent with the promises he made as a candidate.
Nearly eight months past Mr. Trump's inauguration, there is no assistant secretary for the Western hemisphere. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is said to rely heavily on Mr. Shannon's regional expertise. A career civil servant, Mr. Shannon often was called on to execute President Obama's "engagement" strategy toward thuggish regimes. Absent new direction from the top, it is no surprise that he and his cohorts at State still defend the Obama policies that Mr. Trump promised to reverse.


The Ninth Circuit 'Resistance'
Some federal judges have joined the "resistance" to President Trump, but the Supreme Court doesn't seem happy about it. See the Court's pithy rebuke Monday to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which last week defied a Supreme Court decision on the Trump travel ban.
In June the High Court allowed most of Mr. Trump's executive order temporarily suspending refugee admissions and visas for travelers from six countries pending legal challenges. The Court carved out an exception for foreigners with a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States." For instance, those with children or parents in the U.S. or who have been admitted to American universities.
Federal Judge Derrick Watson in July effectively enjoined the Trump travel ban in toto—and overruled the Supreme Court's order—by extending the "bona fide" exemption to grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, cousins, brothers-in-law as well as refugees with no claim on the U.S. The judge held that refugee resettlement agreements between nonprofits and the federal government could constitute a formal relationship. But if the Supreme Court had intended an exception for refugees, it would have said so.
A Ninth Circuit panel—all Bill Clinton appointees—upheld Judge Watson, but the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to stay the ruling. Justice challenged only the Ninth Circuit's decision applying to refugees, which it argued "would as a practical matter render" the Supreme Court's decision a "dead letter."
The Supreme Court seems to agree, judging by Justice Anthony Kennedy's one-sentence order staying the Ninth Circuit ruling. The order allows the Trump Administration and Hawaii Attorney General to submit arguments on whether refugees can claim a "bona fide" relationship by virtue of their resettlement agreements. These arguments can be fleshed out next month when the High Court hears challenges to the travel ban on the legal merits.


Brussels Learns Nothing
Brussels laid out its ideas Wednesday for how the European Union can reform itself after Britain leaves, and it's enough to make you wonder if the goal is to push everyone else toward the exit too. Instead of doubling down on those features that deliver more prosperity, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker seems to want to do the opposite.
Even though he didn't mention Britain much in his hourlong address, Mr. Juncker's annual State of the Union speech was partly about taking revenge for Brexit. He promised to reform the EU in ways that would make Britain sorry to be leaving such a wonderful club.
Some elements of his agenda will induce envy in London. He promised to push ahead on trade negotiations with a range of partners "lining up at our door." This includes dusting off long-moribund discussions with Australia and New Zealand.
This is a smart strategy to try to thwart global protectionist impulses emanating from Donald Trump's Washington, and Brussels is negotiating with Mexico and some South American governments. Concluding these deals would be a poke at Britain, which is likely to struggle to sign its own trade agreements by 2019.
Yet much of Mr. Juncker's plan is a head scratcher. He bowed to French and German pressure to give Brussels more power to block foreign investment into the EU, especially by Chinese companies. If London eschews such protectionism, this will become an invest-in-Britain-instead clause.


Latest Berkeley Protest is Largely Peaceful
BERKELEY, Calif.—A protest against a speech given by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro at the University of California here Thursday evening was largely peaceful amid a massive police presence.
Nine people were arrested, including four for carrying banned weapons. The city recently banned items such as pipes, poles and sticks in protest areas. There were no reported injuries and no reports of any damage to property, according to Berkeley police.
The event was seen as a test for the city and the university as they ready for series of speeches from conservative personalities, including former White House adviser Steve Bannon, beginning later this month that are expected to draw large demonstrations.
Scores of police officers in riot gear patrolled the streets and the university closed access to the area around Zellerbach Hall where the event took place in an effort to avoid violent protests seen at previous events here.
However, neither the anti-fascists for white nationalists who fought each other at previous Berkeley protests showed up en masse Thursday.


Republicans Press Graham-Cassidy Repeal Effort
WASHINGTON—Republicans pushed ahead with a last-minute effort to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act, preparing for a meeting of GOP senators Tuesday to discuss the latest version and opponents mobilizing to block it.
The legislation by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana is gaining attention after senators of both parties assumed the GOP health push was dead. The bill will be the subject of committee hearings next week, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects to reach at least a partial analysis of the proposal early next week.
On Monday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he supports the effort, which could help gain support from Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who voted against an earlier GOP repeal bill.
Mr. Cassidy told reporters Friday he believes 48 or 49 GOP senators support the bill. Fewer than that have publicly committed to the legislation, however, and it remains unclear if it has the momentum supporters claim.
The legislation would largely turn over federal funding from the ACA to states that could then set up their own health systems. Republicans behind the legislation say they also hope to announce soon that as many as 20 governors back the bill.


Aung San Suu Kyi and the Rohingyas
Burma's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday dismissed accusations that her country's military is ethnically cleansing minority Rohingyas. She says soldiers are exercising restraint as they respond to terrorist attacks, most Rohingya communities have been unaffected by the violence in Rakhine state, and there have been no armed clashes since Sept. 5.
The facts on the ground tell a different story. More than 400,000 Rohingyas, almost half their population in Burma, have fled into Bangladesh—most of them since Sept. 5. They came with few or no possessions, sometimes walking for days to cross the border or risking their lives on overcrowded boats.
The refugees say Burmese soldiers raped and murdered family members and burned their villages. Satellite photos show that about 80 Rohingya villages across an area 100 kilometers wide were burned, and the smoke from more fires is visible from inside Bangladesh. The United Nations' top human-rights official calls the violence "a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."
International supporters of Ms. Suu Kyi are shocked by her indifference to the Rohingyas' suffering, but they shouldn't be. "The Lady," as she was portrayed in the 2011 film, may have acquired a reputation as a human-rights campaigner during her fight for democracy against the Burmese junta. But even then she made clear that she was a Burmese nationalist in the mold of her father, Gen. Aung San, who founded the country. She endorsed military actions against other minority insurgencies while atrocities were occurring.
Regarding the dark-skinned and Muslim Rohingyas, Ms. Suu has always refused to call them by the name they have used for centuries. Her government now labels the Rohingyas "Bengalis" to emphasize that they don't deserve Burmese citizenship.


Testimony Differs in NYPD-James Blake Case of Mistaken Identity
James Blake said he felt "extremely vulnerable" when a New York City police officer ran across 42nd Street and tackled him outside Manhattan's Grand Hyatt hotel as he waited for a car to the U.S. Open, the retired tennis star testified on the first day of a department trial at police headquarters.
But Officer James Frascatore, in his first public comments on the incident, testified that he acted appropriately and thought he was pursuing a violent felon accused of credit-card fraud.
The case of mistaken identity, which took place in September 2015, was captured on surveillance camera.
"This is a pattern that can be stopped right now," Mr. Blake, 37 years old, said in a press briefing after his testimony. "This officer shouldn't have a job. He doesn't have the temperament for it."
The Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city's independent police oversight agency, investigated and accused Officer Frascatore, 40, of using excessive force a month after the incident. The agency investigates civilian complaints and sometimes serves as the prosecution in department disciplinary trials—including in the trial on Tuesday.


Senate Republicans Reach a Deal on Budget
WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans reached a deal Tuesday that would allow tax cuts over the next decade, bridging party divides over trade-offs between tax cuts and budget deficits and taking an important step toward tax-overhaul legislation.
Sens. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), representing opposing fiscal-policy viewpoints in the Senate Budget Committee, said Tuesday that they struck the agreement, which senators said could lead to a committee vote as early as next week.
Mr. Toomey had been seeking tax cuts that might reduce revenues by as much as $2 trillion over a decade. Mr. Corker, more wary of budget deficits, had been arguing for a smaller number. The number could be up to $1.5 trillion in revenue-reducing tax cuts, but neither senator would confirm the figure in advance of a formal announcement.
Mr. Corker said he was willing to let the budget move ahead to get the tax bill started. He said he would judge the eventual tax plan by how much it encouraged economic growth and avoided increasing budget deficits.
"Those two guys had the biggest difference that we had to iron out, so I'm very encouraged," said Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), a Budget Committee member.


In Mexico Quake, Geography and Building Codes Had Key Roles
MEXICO CITY—This city is one of the worst places to be when an earthquake strikes. That's because it sits on a former lake bed and near an array of tectonic plates that have been crashing into each other for more than a million years.
Mexico City's central neighborhoods were built on the bed of a long since drained highland lake on whose islands the Aztecs had built their city. The soft lake bed means that when a quake strikes, the ground goes very wobbly.
"Think of a bowl of jelly. If you shake it, it just keeps on shaking," said Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey.
As an earthquake hits, soft materials, like clay, near the surface slow down incoming seismic waves, causing an energy pileup that can further augment shaking, according to Jascha Polet, a seismologist at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.
Sometimes, the soft sediment moves on its own in response to the earth shifting, further increasing the risk for structural damage to buildings, seismologists said. That additional movement can continue after the earthquake has stopped.


Trump Goes Nuclear
On July 28 this year, North Korea's Kim Jong Un tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. Analysts said its potential flight path on an optimum trajectory could travel some 6,400 miles. We can't help but notice that most of the commentators who are dumping condescension on President Trump for threatening to "totally destroy North Korea" live in New York or Washington rather than Seattle or San Francisco. Or Seoul or Tokyo or anywhere people live who no longer see Kim's 250-kiloton bomb—about 17 times as big as what hit Hiroshima in 1945—as an intellectual or journalistic abstraction.
Mr. Trump violated foreign-policy sensibilities on the Eastern Seaboard by saying out loud what has been an implicit reality of U.S. strategic policy since the dawn of the nuclear age: We reserve the right to use nuclear weapons to pre-empt a first strike from an adversary, and that includes an enemy's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. The reason resided in one simple Cold-War word: deterrence.
Toward the end of the Obama presidency, concerns emerged that Mr. Obama would adopt the "no first use" doctrine on nuclear weapons long favored by progressive arms-control activists. He did not. Also worth keeping in mind amid the outcry that Mr. Trump's speech violated some sort of international gentlemen's agreement is that NATO has refused for 70 years to adopt no first use.
Until recently, no American president needed to make such threats in public. An assumption of the Cold War was that the Soviet Union's leadership ultimately was rational, and so we negotiated nuclear agreements with them. Some similar baseline of assumed rationality attached to dealing with each subsequent nuclear power, such as China, India and even Pakistan.
Pakistan and India—estimated to have more than 100 nuclear warheads each—rattled the world's nerves as recently as 2002, when the two countries massed armies along their 2,000-mile border after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament.


GOP Mayoral Candidate Takes Aim at de Blasio's Record on Homelessness
Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, said she would divert tens of millions of dollars slated for homeless shelters toward building permanent housing instead.
"Let's not commit individuals to long periods, or life in a shelter," Ms. Malliotakis said at a news conference in Queens, taking aim at Mayor Bill de Blasio's handling of the crisis as the number of homeless people has risen in New York City.
The number of people living in shelters reached more than 60,000 last year. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has pledged to spend millions to build 90 new shelters over five years.
His rival, Ms. Malliotakis, a state Assemblywoman from Staten Island, said building permanent housing was "truly the compassionate thing to do."
Ms. Malliotakis didn't have details Wednesday about how and where the permanent housing would be built, how much it would cost and how long it would take to implement the plan.


First Woman Set to Graduate From Marine Infantry-Officer Course
A female Marine is set to graduate from the grueling infantry-officer course next week and become the first woman in the Marine Corps' 241-year history eligible for a job commanding ground troops, officials said Thursday.
The woman, whose identity hasn't been released by the Marines, is the fourth woman to attempt the course since ground-combat jobs opened to women last year. Previous female candidates didn't complete the 13-week course, which places a heavy emphasis on physical endurance.
"She is a first, but she can't be the last," said Kate Germano, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who led an all-female recruit battalion at the Parris Island, S.C., boot camp.
"The only way to change the culture of the Corps is to ensure men and women work together in every job in every unit," Ms. Germano said in an email.
The officer is scheduled to graduate Monday, along with her male counterparts, at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Va.
The woman has declined to take part in any media events surrounding her graduation, the Marines said weeks ago. Officials said they won't release her name due to privacy concerns.
The event, unlike many military graduations, isn't marked by bands and marching. It typically is a subdued affair more akin to an initiation than a public spectacle.
Servicewomen—from truck drivers to engineers—have frequently found themselves in combat during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but they were prohibited from serving in ground-combat jobs, such as infantry, tanks and artillery.
In 2013, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta rescinded the ban, but gave the branches time to decide on how to study and implement the change. The Marines largely resisted, conducting extensive tests to assess the viability of allowing women into those positions, and its impact on unit performance.
In late 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter fully rescinded the ban and the Marines soon fell in line.
The woman isn't the first to complete a Marine Corps infantry school. In 2013, a trio of enlisted women—as opposed to officers—became the first to graduate from the School of Infantry, although they weren't guaranteed jobs in the infantry after finishing their training.

NTSB Cites Cockpit Errors in Pence Plane Incident Last Year
Investigators have determined that pilot violations of several basic landing safeguards that ended with opposing commands from the captain and co-pilot caused then-vice presidential candidate Mike Pence's chartered jet to roll off the end of a wet New York runway last October.
The findings of procedural mistakes, released Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, reiterate earlier indications that the Boeing Co. 737 touched down thousands of feet past the beginning of the strip at New York City's LaGuardia Airport and the crew failed to promptly retard the throttles or manually deploy panels on top of the wings designed to slow the aircraft.
But the report also concludes there was a breakdown of cockpit discipline and teamwork, citing the captain's actions on the ground to take over control of the plane without telling his co-pilot as required. Poor communication and the captain's "lack of command authority," according to the report, resulted in both aviators trying to move the rudder but putting in "directional inputs that were at odds."
None of the 48 people on board were hurt in the high-profile incident, but the plane ended up 170 feet past the runway's end.
Crew mistakes cited by the safety board began when the pilots failed to halt the approach before the aircraft touched down at the 4,200-foot mark of the 7,100-foot runway. It took the co-pilot, who was flying the approach, 16 seconds to pull the power completely back after he raised the nose and prepared to land. The captain then waited nearly five seconds after touchdown to deploy the wing panels, and maximum reverse thrust wasn't commanded for another 3.5 seconds.


Does Medicaid Spur Opioid Abuse?
Forty-one state attorneys general are investigating drug manufacturers and distributors for fanning the opioid epidemic; several have already sued. The allegation is that Big Pharma used deceptive marketing to hook millions of Americans on prescription painkillers, which served as gateway drugs to more potent opioids like heroin and fentanyl.
But government health-care programs are among the biggest suppliers of prescription painkillers. The attorneys general ought to be investigating how Medicaid may help promote opiate abuse and addiction.
Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson this summer highlighted a correlation between the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion and opioid overdoses. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that overdose deaths per capita rose twice as much on average between 2013 and 2015 in states that expanded Medicaid than those that didn't—for example, 205% in North Dakota, which expanded Medicaid, vs. 18% in South Dakota, which didn't. That's particularly striking since the energy boom boosted North Dakota's economy and employment.
ObamaCare defenders note that the disparity in overdose fatalities appears to have begun around 2010—but due largely to sharp increases in a few expansion states, most notably West Virginia. What's more, the disaggregated data show that the disparity between expansion and nonexpansion states with similar demographics and geography increased markedly after 2013. Between 2010 and 2013, overdose deaths rose by 28% in Ohio and 36% in Wisconsin. Between 2013 and 2015, they climbed 39% in Ohio, which expanded Medicaid, but only 2% in Wisconsin, which did not.
Overdose deaths aren't the only measure of opioid abuse. Another is hospital and emergency-room admissions. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the number of opioid-related inpatient hospital stays nationwide (among states submitting data) that were paid for by Medicaid increased by about 40% between the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2014—about four times the rate of growth in Medicaid enrollment. Patient stays covered by private insurance increased 4% during this period.


North Korean Threat to Down U.S. Bombers Has Cold War Echoes
In 1969, a North Korean pilot shot down a U.S. military aircraft over international waters, killing its entire crew, in a Cold War episode that holds lessons today, both for Pyongyang's capacity for confrontation and for Washington's limited options.
Then-President Richard Nixon said he wanted to respond and reassure jittery regional allies that their unpredictable neighbor would be restrained, after the North Korean MiG 21s's attack on a U.S. EC-121 killed the crew of 30 sailors and one Marine. But the U.S. found itself with few options and its resources entangled by another war—Vietnam.
The challenges of responding to North Korean aggression nearly 50 years ago mirrors concerns President Donald Trump faces today. On Monday, North Korea's foreign minister threatened to shoot down U.S. aircraft flying in international space, after two U.S. bombers flew off the peninsula's eastern coast on Saturday in a show of force.
The foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, called President Trump's recent Twitter messages "a declaration of war," a charge the administration denied.
There are obvious differences between the 1969 shootdown and this past weekend's U.S. air operation. The plane targeted In 1969 was an unescorted surveillance craft. Saturday's U.S. flight involved two bombers surrounded by six U.S. jet fighters.


Trump's Too-Big-to-Fail Punt
The Trump Administration has been promising to restore more legal certainty to arbitrary financial rules, but we're beginning to wonder. Financial regulators on Friday failed to decide whether to remove AIG 's "systemically important" label. The political punt underscores the imperative for Treasury to clarify the government's opaque review process and drop its appeal of MetLife 's challenge to its too-big-to-fail status.
Dodd-Frank empowered the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is comprised of 10 regulatory heads, with deciding whether nonbanks are "systemically important financial institutions." The Sifi label imposes bank-style liquidity and capital requirements, among other compliance burdens, in return for an implicit taxpayer guarantee.
While the law outlined myriad criteria that FSOC could consider, Dodd-Frank left enormous discretion to regulators to write and enforce the rules. After a formal rule-making, FSOC in 2012 identified six factors it would use to assess a nonbank's vulnerability to financial distress and how its potential instability could affect the broader financial system.
Yet in its analysis of MetLife, an insurance company that isn't a bank, FSOC considered only the risks to the financial system. It failed to weigh MetLife's liquidity risk or leverage, both of which showed financial strength. The council provided no explanation for why it departed from its guidance, nor did FSOC calculate the costs of its designation.
Metlife sued, and last year federal Judge Rosemary Collyer issued a scathing rebuke of the council's "arbitrary and capricious" designation. In addition to rapping FSOC for not evaluating MetLife's vulnerability, Judge Collyer explained that the council "never projected what the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets, or how the market would destabilize" if MetLife failed.


Second-Class Puerto Rico
The devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is awful to behold, and the Trump Administration will have to mobilize more resources to help. Here's one idea: Suspend the law that raises the price of sea-borne energy and food shipments to the island.
We're talking about the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act. The law requires that goods transported between U.S. ports be shipped on vessels built, majority-owned and manned by Americans. Think of it as a legally sanctioned shakedown for U.S. shipping interests.
Puerto Ricans pay dearly for this protectionism, which reduces competition and raises costs. A 2012 Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said the Jones Act helps explain why household and commercial goods cost roughly double to ship from the East Coast to Puerto Rico than to the nearby Dominican Republic or Jamaica. Food and energy costs are far higher than on the mainland.
Presidents of both parties have suspended the Jones Act to alleviate fuel shortages and enlist the aid of cheaper, foreign-flagged ships during previous emergencies. George W. Bush did it after Hurricane Katrina, and Barack Obama did so after superstorm Sandy. The Trump Administration followed after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma ripped through Texas and Florida in August and September.
The aftermath of Hurricane Maria is an even more urgent emergency. The Category 4 storm shut down electricity, destroyed crops, and has residents scrambling to obtain food and potable water. Many of the island's 3.4 million residents may not have power restored for weeks. At least 10 people have died, and rescue operations will be needed for months. Allowing Puerto Ricans to import cheaper petroleum, equipment and bulk supplies would help.


Sessions Defends First-Amendment Rights on Campuses
Attorney General Jeff Sessions jumped into the national debate about speech on college campuses Tuesday, taking aim at American universities that he said were becoming a "shelter for fragile egos" and were incapable of fostering meaningful discussions.
In remarks at Georgetown University in Washington, Mr. Sessions said the Justice Department would be more active in defending the First Amendment on campus. He also sided with President Donald Trump in criticizing players who protest before National Football League games, saying, "The president has free speech rights, too."
"I agree that it's a big mistake to protest in that fashion, because it weakens the commitment we have to this nation that is providing us this freedom," Mr. Sessions said, referring to NFL players who kneel during the playing of the national anthem. Mr. Sessions added that it was up to team owners to determine what happens on their fields.
Following Mr. Sessions' speech, the Justice Department announced it had filed a "statement of interest" in a lawsuit by an evangelical Christian student at Georgia Gwinnett College. The student sued the university last year, alleging that it had violated the First Amendment with a policy restricting where individuals could distribute literature and speak publicly.
The university said in court documents that other students had complained about the student's "open-air speaking" because he was disturbing the peace, and that an officer had asked the student to engage in "one-on-one conversations with people."


Tax Reform, If You Can Keep It
Republicans finally unveiled the party's blueprint for tax reform on Wednesday, and Americans who want a faster-growing economy should be pleased. The GOP has offered an outline that will enhance U.S. competitiveness and simplify the code—if the final product isn't diluted by the class-warfare brigades and K Street lobbyists.
The nine-page framework offers the contours worked out by GOP leaders and tax writers in Congress and the Trump Administration, and the goal is to lower rates and streamline preferences. The danger is that the opening offer is near the lower limits of what is needed to lift the economy to a higher growth plane, and Republicans don't have room for concessions to this or that interest group.
The most important news is that the plan would make U.S. businesses more competitive around the globe. The corporate rate will fall to 20% from 35%, which is the highest in the developed world. This is not as low as President Trump's floated 15% or Ireland's 12.5% but would bring the U.S. below the industrialized-world's 22.5% average. This would improve U.S. corporate tax competitiveness from a depressing 35th out of 35 nations in the Tax Foundation's annual index, which is below even France. (See nearby.)
The framework also moves to a territorial model that allows companies to pay taxes where income is earned, which is the global norm. The punishing U.S. system has left $2.5 trillion parked overseas, and that money will be invited back at a discount with illiquid assets paying a lower rate than cash. The changes will be permanent, which is important as corporations invest with a long tail, and they will be immediate, which means investors won't have to wait to see the benefit of lower rates.
Small businesses with owners who "pass through" income to personal returns would see a top rate reduction to 25% from 39.6%. This will require some finesse, as tax writers must develop guardrails that prevent lawyers or hedge-fund operators from dumping wages into pass-throughs and paying less than salary folks. Such businesses will pay a slightly higher top rate than corporations, but the latter are taxed twice: once on income, again on dividends or capital gains.


U.S. Weighs Fate of Taliban Political Office, Prompting Internal Objection
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is considering a plan that would aim to close the Taliban political office in Qatar, a move that triggered an unusual internal protest by State Department officials who said it would undermine U.S. interests in Afghanistan, according to current and former U.S. officials.
A group of State Department specialists on South Asia filed the rare internal "dissent channel cable" on Friday to urge that the U.S. keep the Taliban office open and launch more-intensive talks to end the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan, according to people familiar with the move.
The memo was signed by a handful of officials, the people said, including some longtime State Department employees whose contracts with the department expired on Friday and weren't renewed.
"We are grateful for the previous team's hard work in trying to promote peace and reconciliation," said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman. "Talented officials from within the system will continue these efforts. Our willingness to support a reconciliation process is not in question; the willingness of the Taliban to seriously engage is."
The unclassified memo to top State Department leaders urged them to keep the Taliban office open to help ensure that a serious push for peace talks isn't put on the back burner while the U.S. sends 4,000 more U.S. forces into Afghanistan to try to break a battlefield stalemate with the Taliban.


U.K.'s Theresa May Says Her Cabinet Is 'United'
MANCHESTER, England—British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday played down public divisions within her top team over her plans for Britain's exit from the European Union, as her party gathered for its annual conference in the northern city of Manchester.
The gathering, the first since the Conservative Party, under Mrs. May's leadership, lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, comes at a difficult moment for the British leader as she seeks to manage splits in her party and the electorate over Brexit.
On the eve the conference, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson set out a series of aims for Brexit negotiations that go beyond those outlined by the prime minister, underscoring the difficulty of her political position.
Over the coming days in Manchester, Mrs. May will seek to appeal to the Conservative Party base, the majority of whom voted for Brexit and are looking for clarity on her long-term vision for Britain's exit and for her to take a strong stand in negotiations.
But she also is expected to be careful not to reverse any goodwill she built up with EU leaders in a key speech in Florence, Italy, where she sought to revitalize stalled Brexit talks by saying the U.K. would honor its financial commitments to the EU's current budget for two years after its planned exit.


Of Judges and Gerrymanders
Partisan gerrymanders predate the republic, though improved technology has made it easier for politicians to pick their voters. This makes elections less competitive and politics perhaps more polarized, but the question before the Supreme Court on Tuesday is whether judges should become the deciders in what Felix Frankfurter called "this political thicket."
At issue in Whitford v. Gill is whether Republicans who controlled the Wisconsin legislature after 2010 drafted an Assembly map that abridged equal protection and freedom of association of Democrats. The Supreme Court has consistently held that redistricting is intrinsically political, but its 1986 Davis v. Bandemer precedent said judges could nonetheless review partisan gerrymanders for potential constitutional violations. The unsolvable problem is determining a standard for judging political bias.
In Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004), the Court's four liberals and four conservatives split over whether to overturn Bandemer. Writing for the conservative plurality, Antonin Scalia argued that since "no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims have emerged," courts shouldn't gratuitously insert themselves into the politics of redistricting.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote as ever, concurred that there is nothing inherently invidious about a legislature considering partisanship. "Race is an impermissible classification," he noted. "Politics is quite a different matter." But he was open to judicial relief "if some limited and precise rationale" could be found to set district lines.
He also teed up Gill by opining that the First Amendment may be more relevant than the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth since partisan redistricting may punish "citizens because of their participation in the electoral process, their voting history, their association with a political party."


Las Vegas Hospitals Face Range of Horrific Injuries
Hospitals in Las Vegas are grappling with a range of patient injuries that reflect the chaos of Sunday evening's mass shooting, including horrific gunshot wounds and traumas inflicted as victims tried to flee.
Local hospitals called in extra staff as well as medical personnel from a nearby Air Force base to cope with the onslaught, as authorities on Monday reported at least 59 deaths and more than 527 wounded from the tragedy outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
Leading the trauma response is University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, which had 50 doctors treating more than 100 patients with injuries including gunshot wounds and trauma suffered when victims were hit by cars while fleeing the scene.
The wounded streamed in by ambulance as well as personal vehicles, said Medical Director John Fildes, who also chairs the hospital's trauma department.
Deborah Kuhls, a surgeon and director of the hospital's trauma intensive care unit, said the gunshot traumas ranged from "devastating brain injuries" to chest, abdomen and bowel wounds to broken bones and major blood loss. "We had friends and family putting them in the back of a pickup truck and bringing them to the trauma center or the main ER," Dr. Kuhls said in an interview Monday.


About That Trump Dossier 'Wall'
More non-news on the Russia-collusion front came Wednesday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee said it has now verified what everyone knew nine months ago: Russia worked to sow chaos during the 2016 election; vote totals weren't affected; and no evidence has emerged that Donald Trump was in cahoots with Moscow.
But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the "chaos" Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.
That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.
How close was Fusion's leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.
Witness how hard the Federal Bureau of Investigation is fighting to avoid divulging any information about the dossier. More than a month ago the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the FBI and the Justice Department, asking for dossier-related documents. Lawmakers were told to go swivel.


Columbus Day Parade Watchers Boo Bill de Blasio
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was bombarded with boos as he walked in the annual Columbus Day parade because of the city's decision to review an iconic sculpture of Christopher Columbus.
Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, in August established a commission to make recommendations on how the city should handle monuments some may view as offensive.
Columbus, whose statue adorns the Midtown Manhattan traffic circle named after him, is revered by New York's vast Italian-American community. Others have said the explorer's legacy should be re-examined in light of the deaths of Native Americans after the arrival of Europeans to the Americas.
Some parade watchers were having none of it. "Leave Columbus alone!" one man shouted as the mayor walked by. A woman cursed at the mayor in Italian.
Mr. de Blasio, whose grandparents were born in Italy, ignored the shouts, walking about 30 blocks while waving an Italian flag and smiling.


Deadly California Wildfires Rip Through Once-Safe Areas
SANTA ROSA, Calif.—Fire officials on Tuesday issued grim tallies as more than a dozen wildfires ripped through Northern California: at least 17 people dead, more than 100 missing, 20,000 evacuated, 115,000 acres charred, and at least 2,000 homes and businesses destroyed.
The largest fire chewed more than a mile into the city of Santa Rosa, destroying entire neighborhoods and signaling a new reality in the state that even urban communities considered safe for decades are now vulnerable to wildfires.
State and local officials said hotter temperatures, longer fire seasons and development pushing into wilderness areas are leading to more destructive wildfires closer to population centers.
"These are the fires that we're going to be experiencing into the future," said Ken Pimlott chief of CAL-FIRE, the state's firefighting agency. Mr. Pimlott expects that at least one of the fires currently burning will ultimately rank among the 20 most destructive in the state's history.
Most of the damage has been concentrated in Northern California's famous wine regions of Sonoma and Napa counties. In Sonoma County alone, nine people have been killed and more than 100 others reported missing. State and local officials fear the death toll could keep climbing.


U.S. Officials Back Trump's Stance on Iran
U.S. officials defended President Donald Trump's refusal to certify the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, saying the country threatens global stability even while technically complying with the accord itself.
Iran is "the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism," Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday on NBC. "You look at the ballistic missile tests that they continue to do. You look at the arms sales. When you look at all the trouble they're causing around the world, what the president is saying is, 'It's not proportionate. We need to look at this.'"
Ms. Haley stopped short of saying Iran had violated the terms of the agreement, however. "No one is questioning..they are in compliance" with inspections to determine if they are developing a nuclear weapon, she said, but that shouldn't prevent Mr. Trump from seeking a better deal.
The comments by Ms. Haley and other senior officials Sunday followed Mr. Trump's Friday speech at the White House where the president reiterated his fierce opposition to the terms of the deal—under which Iran agreed to put limits on its disputed nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions—after denouncing what he called a "rogue regime" run by radicals.
Mr. Trump on Friday took Iran to task for a number of destabilizing behaviors, including its missile program. He said his administration would aim to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to address the other threats the country poses.


U.S. Nafta Negotiator Takes Aim at Rivals
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump's top trade negotiator exchanged public barbs Tuesday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts as well as U.S. businesses, magnifying large gaps over the North American Free Trade Agreement and highlighting the obstacles to keeping the pact alive.
"Frankly, I'm surprised and disappointed by the resistance to change from our negotiating partners," U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters after a week of talks on renegotiating Nafta, as Mexican and Canadian ministers stood beside him.
The resistance, countered Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, was in response to a "troubling" vision of change that would "turn back the clock on 23 years of predictability, openness, and collaboration" and in some cases would violate global trading rules.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was more muted in his criticism, but in a later press briefing talked openly about the need for an alternative plan should the talks fall apart. Ms. Freeland did the same.
Mr. Lighthizer also made clear that any successful negotiation, in his view, will have to run roughshod over big U.S. business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which have traditionally been the backbone of support for free-trade pacts. Mr. Lighthizer escalated his war of words with the Chamber and other groups that have campaigned to quash the Trump administration's proposals aimed at redefining Nafta in a way that would weaken many of its incentives and protections for creating a more integrated regional economy.


Clinton: U.S. Threats of War With North Korea 'Dangerous and Shortsighted'
SEOUL—Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state oversaw President Barack Obama's policy on North Korea, criticized the Trump administration's bellicose language toward Pyongyang and warned that the approach isn't working on Kim Jong Un.
In a speech at a forum here Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the U.S.'s war of words with the North Korean dictator was damaging American interests.
"Americans as well as Koreans have every right to be concerned about what path we are heading down," she said.
"Picking fights with Kim Jong Un just puts a smile on his face."
President Donald Trump and Mr. Kim have traded barbs in recent months, their quarrel fueled by Pyongyang's advancing weapons program and Washington's warnings of possible military action. Mr. Trump has referred to Mr. Kim as "little rocket man" and threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. Mr. Kim, meanwhile, has labeled the U.S. president a "dotard" and "mentally deranged."


As Iraqi Forces Consolidate Control in North, Kurds Flee
KIRKUK, Iraq—Thousands of Kurdish civilians fled their homes in northern Iraq on Wednesday, fearing harassment by government forces and Shiite militias who have taken control of a vast swath of territory from Kurdish fighters.
Cars clogged checkpoints along the main road out of the city of Kirkuk as Kurdish residents rushed to leave, days after Iraqi forces entered it to reimpose federal government authority. The city had been under full Kurdish control since 2014.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, emboldened by a series of victories against Islamic State, ordered Iraqi forces into Kirkuk on Monday. The army faced little resistance from Peshmerga fighters, who fled and have since surrendered much of the territory outside the boundaries of the Kurds' semiautonomous region.
South of Kirkuk, the entire Kurdish population of Tuz Khurmato left the town when Peshmerga forces protecting them retreated, and local Turkmen—many of whom belong to government-backed Shiite paramilitary groups—ransacked and torched their homes, local residents and officials said.
The reported violence and exodus shows how shifts in power in northern Iraq can lead to demographic movements that threaten to unleash new conflicts between the diverse ethnic groups in the disputed territories.


What Brings Trump and Macron Together
Paris
What Europe lacks most today, French President Emmanuel Macron believes, is a common strategic culture. In his view, that means one that is interventionist, has a single doctrine for taking action, and has a joint budget for producing its own military hardware. "Our inability to work together convincingly undermines our credibility," Mr. Macron asserted in a speech at the Sorbonne last month.
Correct. And, although he won't say it, this reality savages the idea that the European Union, in an undertaking called Defence Europe, could emerge as a military player of sufficient substance and boldness to inhibit Russia in Eastern Europe or stare down a threat in the Middle East.
Two Fridays ago, Mr. Macron publicly received the 2017 Strategic Review, a 100-page doctrinal summary drawn up by a panel of experts proud of France's "strategic singularity"—its nuclear strike forces, its capacity to intervene rapidly around the globe, and its permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council. In an uncertain time, the review essentially repeated, as expected, what Mr. Macron has said must be Europe's goal for 2020: "autonomous European operating capabilities in complement to NATO."
Yet the document, in its published version, skipped naming the central element smothering a common European strategic culture: Germany and its passivity. Although this reality discomforts Mr. Macron's sought-after closeness with Chancellor Angela Merkel, members of the French defense community attacked Germany's soft strategic stance at a closed seminar last month.


Labor Department to Appeal Ruling Striking Down Obama-Era Overtime-Pay Rule
WASHINGTON—The Labor Department will appeal a judge's ruling that struck down an overtime-pay rule authored by the Obama administration, a move designed to preserve the Trump administration's authority to reshape the rule to its own liking.
By filing the appeal, the department is seeking to maintain Secretary Alexander Acosta's ability to establish overtime regulations, a Labor Department official said Friday evening. The appeal shouldn't be viewed as the Trump administration endorsing the threshold set in regulations issued last year, according to the official.
The department will file an appeal Monday of a ruling issued by a federal judge in Texas, and then ask the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana to stay the case to allow the department time to rewrite the regulations, the official said.
In late August, U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant found invalid a rule that would have extended eligibility for time-and-a-half overtime pay to millions more Americans. Under the regulation, which hadn't yet gone into effect, nearly all workers earning less than $47,476 a year would have been eligible for extra pay when they worked more than 40 hours in a week.
The judge found the Obama-era rule invalid because it rendered irrelevant a test established by Congress that alternatively determined overtime eligibility based on a worker's duties. Judge Mazzant temporarily blocked the rule from going into effect on Dec. 1, 2016, after states and business groups sued the Labor Department.


Ousted Catalonia Leader Calls on Citizens for Peaceful Demonstrations
BARCELONA—The leader of the separatist movement in Catalonia called on Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid's takeover of the region, signaling that pro-independence forces will try to resist direct rule from the Spanish government.
The government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy seized control of the northeastern region late Friday and ousted Carles Puigdemont as president in a bid to quell Catalonia's drive for independence. The decision came hours after separatist lawmakers in Catalonia's parliament voted in favor of independence for the wealthy region, in breach of Spain's constitution.
In remarks Saturday, Mr. Puigdemont called on Catalans to peacefully oppose those measures, which he called undemocratic. "In a democratic society, parliaments elect or oust presidents," he said, speaking from a podium with the official Catalan government emblem. Behind him hung Catalan and European Union flags. He also called for "democratic opposition to the application of" direct rule.
The first signs of whether the separatists will adhere to Mr. Puigdemont's call could come on Monday, when government workers decide whether to return to jobs they no longer hold. Madrid's orders involved the removal of about 150 officials associated with the separatist government.
Mr. Puigdemont didn't clarify whether he would step down. The Catalan regional government's official Twitter page continued to refer to him as president of the region on Saturday. On Friday, the Spanish government said that Mr. Rajoy's deputy prime minister will supplant Mr. Puigdemont as temporary head of the government in Catalonia.


Two Fatal Navy Ship Collisions Were Avoidable, Reports Conclude
WASHINGTON—Two U.S. Navy collisions that killed 17 sailors this year were avoidable, according to a pair of reports on the accidents released Wednesday that cited failures in a number of areas, from steering and navigation to what officials describe as the culture aboard each of the ships.
Two destroyers, the USS John McCain and the USS Fitzgerald, were involved in separate wrecks. The Fitzgerald collided with a commercial vessel in June, killing seven sailors; the McCain collided with a tanker in August, killing 10 sailors.
"Both of these accidents were preventable and the respective investigations found multiple failures by watch standers that contributed to the incidents," said Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson, in a statement issued Wednesday morning. "We must do better."
Adm. Richardson said the Navy must learn from its lapses, and plans to announce on Thursday a series of actions to improve training, protocols and cultural issues that officials believe contributed to the two fatal collisions.
The incidents have cost high-ranking naval officials their careers. In addition to removing senior officers on each of the ships, the Navy also immediately relieved the Seventh Fleet commander, Adm. Joseph Aucoin.


Concrete Barriers to Be Installed Along Hudson River Greenway
Concrete barriers are being deployed along the Hudson River Greenway in Manhattan where a truck killed eight people and injured 12 in a terrorist attack this week.
A spokesman for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that six rectangular barriers will be placed at each of the 31 points where vehicles intersect with the bike path between 59th Street and the Battery.
The spokesman, Ben Sarle, added that two cube-shaped barriers will be placed at each of 26 pedestrian intersections on the Hudson River side of the cycle path. The work began on Thursday, Mr. Sarle said.
The deployment of the barriers follows Tuesday's terrorist attack in which, police say, Sayfullo Saipov, 29 years old, drove a truck for nearly a mile down the bike path, south from Pier 40, before crashing into a school bus.
Mr. Saipov appeared in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday. He didn't enter a plea.


Germany Struggles to Balance Terror Defense With Individual Rights
BERLIN—Germany's antiterror posture is facing a shake-up as parties locked in talks about forming the country's next government wrangle over how to balance a strong state and individual liberties.
Last week's arrest of a 19-year-old Syrian man suspected of building a remote-controlled bomb in northern Germany was a stark reminder of how acute a threat Germany still faces even though it hasn't had a large-scale attack for almost a year.
And last week's atrocity in Manhattan, in which a suspected Islamist radical mowed down cyclists and pedestrians with a rented truck, underscored the near-impossible task authorities face in preventing crude yet devastating plots.
Security experts see Germany as particularly exposed because of the departing government's decision to open the country's doors to nearly two million asylum seekers—most of them undocumented—since 2015. Since then, security officials have attributed most terrorist attacks perpetrated in the country to recently arrived migrants.
But how much Berlin can harden its security stance in response to the mounting challenges is in the balance as the three parties that have pledged to try to form a coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel seek to reconcile their views. The talks began in late October and are expected to stretch for weeks.


Democrat Ralph Northam Elected Governor of Virginia
FAIRFAX, VA.—Democrat Ralph Northam captured the Virginia governorship on Tuesday, beating Republican Ed Gillespie in the first major test of how the Donald Trump presidency has affected swing-state politics.
The Associated Press declared Mr. Northam, a 58-year-old physician who is Virginia's lieutenant governor, winner in the race to succeed Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, giving their party another four years in the governor's mansion.
"Virginia, we have witnessed yet another Democratic sweep today," Mr. Northam said at his victory rally, adding that the eyes of the nation were on the state. "Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry."
With 99% of the precincts counted, Mr. Northam had 53.9% of the vote, Mr. Gillespie had 45%.
The decisive win in Virginia, where the governorship has seesawed between the parties in recent years, gave Democrats a double-barreled victory Tuesday night: In New Jersey, voters elected Democrat Phil Murphy governor over Republican Kim Guadagno, ending two terms of GOP control by Gov. Chris Christie.


Will Virginia Teach Trump Fans a Lesson?
Look, it wasn't just Virginia. It was Westchester and Nassau counties in New York. And in Virginia it wasn't only the governorship the Republicans lost. When all the votes are counted, their 66-34 majority in the House of Delegates may turn into a minority.
The Democrats had a big night Tuesday, and the president of the United States took it right in the kisser. And it was all about him.
I spent Wednesday and Thursday talking to Virginia Republicans, from centrists to hard rightists. Not one expressed surprise at the outcome. All acknowledged the cause was Donald Trump.
About future prospects, the state Republican Party was blunt. Yes, out-of-state money and groups had an impact, as did Republican congressional inaction. But 68% of voters under 45 voted Democratic, and Republicans lost nonwhite voters 80% to 20%. "If we do not find a way to appeal to these two groups," the party chairman said in a statement, "the results will be grim."
A smart, experienced Republican elected official: "It was a total repudiation of Trump—no other way around it. Voters, more women than men, were literally walking in and saying 'I'm here to vote against Trump.' The name of the victim on the ballot didn't matter." Accomplished mainstream legislators lost along with bomb throwers.


Sessions Recalls Adviser Mentioning Contacts With Russia
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday that he now recalls a 2016 meeting with a Trump campaign adviser at which the aide spoke about contacts with Russians, after earlier saying he knew of no such contacts.
Mr. Sessions' comments, in an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, highlighted the challenges facing investigators, lawmakers and others in assembling a precise account of the communications between Trump campaign officials and people connected to the Russian government.
In a five-hour appearance that became combative at times, Mr. Sessions defended his changing statements, blaming a turbulent campaign and faulty memory for his failure to recall contacts that two former Trump campaign advisers have disclosed in recent weeks.
"None of you had a part in the Trump campaign," Mr. Sessions told committee members. "And it was a brilliant campaign, I think, in many ways. But it was a form of chaos every day from day one."
Mr. Sessions, a former senator from Alabama, served as a senior adviser to the Trump campaign on national-security issues, and he has been dogged by the continuing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump and his team have said their campaign didn't collude with the Kremlin.


The Roy Moore Mess
A famous country song aptly summed up where the Republicans are with Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama: You've got to know when to fold 'em.
There is no doubt a sense in which Mr. Moore deserves the opportunity to challenge accusations against him for acts alleged to have happened more than 30 years ago. Though too many women were too easily ignored in the past, we do not want to live in a country or political culture in which every accusation of sexual misconduct is automatically accepted as true. Accusers can be liars too.
But Mr. Moore isn't in a courtroom today. He's in the political arena in which a candidate has to maintain a minimal level of public credibility to survive. And his political situation has moved well beyond a more familiar she said/he said predicament.
Several women have made detailed accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moore, and multiple people now say he was known for trolling shopping malls for young girls while in his 30s. Mr. Moore's public defenses have also been less than convincing, not least that he doesn't know his latest accuser, though he signed her yearbook.
Mr. Moore's credibility has fallen below the level of survivability. Some of Mr. Moore's presumed colleagues in the Senate have said they believe the women and that the judge should withdraw. Colorado's Cory Gardner has suggested that even if Mr. Moore wins, the Senate should vote to expel him from the body. It's a rare candidate who achieves that degree of political abandonment.


Cambodia's Supreme Court Outlaws Main Opposition Party
Cambodia's Supreme Court ruled to dissolve the main opposition party, effectively turning the country into the world's newest one-party state and cementing long-serving leader Hun Sen's grip on power.
Prime Minister Hun Sen's government filed the suit to ban the Cambodia National Rescue Party after police arrested its chief figure, Kem Sokha, in Phnom Penh on Sept. 3 and charged him with treason. Prosecutors accused Mr. Kem Sokha of plotting to take over the country with the help of the U.S. But many political analysts and rights groups suggest that Mr. Hun Sen instead is ensuring that his own Cambodian People's Party will win national elections in 2018, after many of the country's opposition groups united behind the CNRP. Mr. Hun Sen has been in power for 32 years.
"Prime Minister Hun Sen seems afraid that he will lose elections scheduled for 2018, so he is using the nuclear option to destroy the opposition," said Brad Adams, Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. "Although the Supreme Court is effectively an organ of the ruling party, it has a historic chance to show some independence and uphold the rule of law."
The U.S. and Australia expressed their concern about the court's ruling, with the White House saying in a statement that it would end its support for Cambodia's election commission. The European Union warned that the verdict could threaten Cambodia's duty and tariff-free access to the trade zone, which has helped the Southeast Asian nation build a textile industry that accounts for most of its exports.
"An electoral process from which the main opposition party has been arbitrarily excluded is not legitimate," an EU spokesperson said in a statement. "Respect of fundamental human rights is a prerequisite for Cambodia to continue to benefit from the EU's preferential Everything but Arms scheme."


Get Real on Pre-Existing Condition Coverage
Chris Pope's "The Individual Mandate Is The Worst Tax Ever" (op-ed, Nov. 13) takes a simple concept and enmeshes it in unnecessary complexity. Let's face it: Covering pre-existing conditions requires either a single-payer system or mandated participation, which the individual mandate tax was intended to encourage. This requirement is no different than that associated with any other insurance program, including home, automobile and life. All participants pay premiums which cover the costs of the less fortunate who experience catastrophe. That's what makes insurance viable.
Unfortunately, our citizens found it less costly to pay the individual mandate tax than buy the insurance, and inasmuch as the Affordable Care Act guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions, knew that they could get coverage when needed at the going rate. We can either not cover pre-existing conditions and force the less fortunate among us to pay a high premium or go without coverage, or have our government, already burdened with a $20-trillion debt, subsidize those with pre-existing conditions. We should do what we do with all of our other types of insurance and pay our fair share, and feel comfort knowing we are protected and that our premiums subsidize the health-care costs of the less fortunate among us.

Bipartisan Effort Would Tighten Gun-Purchase Background Checks
WASHINGTON—Two senators reached a bipartisan agreement this week to tighten the national background-checks system for gun purchases, an effort fueled by the Air Force's failure to submit information about the legal past of the gunman who killed 26 people at a Texas church earlier this month.
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas) has joined Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) to back proposed legislation that would encourage states and federal agencies to submit records to the background-checks system.
Mr. Murphy has been one of the chamber's most vocal advocates of stricter gun laws, and his agreement with a red-state senator is likely to win widespread support among Democrats, an aide said.
"We seem to have found a point of consensus among the right and left," Mr. Cornyn told reporters Thursday.
Mr. Cornyn said aides were checking with Senate offices to see if the bill could be passed swiftly under a process that requires that no senator object. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) has indicated the bill doesn't need to go through his committee, Mr. Cornyn said.


In Tour of House Districts, Democrats Listen for a Message
KANSAS CITY, Mo.—House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer says he came here to listen.
The No. 2 House Democrat on Friday began a series of trips to districts his party must carry if it hopes to win back the House majority in 2018. His goal: to craft a message that resonates with voters only marginally attached to a party dominated by liberals from the coasts.
"We have a lot in common," said Mr. Hoyer, of Maryland, about voters in parts of the Midwest that his party has lost over the years. "But they may say it a different way or see it in a different perspective. They may not think you are talking about what they are thinking about, but you really are."
Republicans control both houses of Congress, the White House, and most state legislatures and governorships. Ten states, all in the mountain West or Midwest, have no Democratic representatives in the House, where the party needs to win 24 seats next year to take the majority.
But after election victories across the country this month, Democratic leaders are optimistic the party can harness voter energy built in large part on animosity toward President Donald Trump. The Cook Political Report rates 62 GOP-held seats as competitive to some degree—17 as tossups and 45 as "likely" or "lean" Republican. Democrats will have to play defense too: Cook lists 21 Democratic seats as competitive, including four tossups.


Border Patrol Agent Killed in Texas
A U.S. Border Patrol agent died Sunday morning after being fatally injured while on patrol in the Big Bend Sector of Texas, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Rogelio Martinez, a 36-year-old agent from El Paso, and his partner, whose name wasn't released, were on patrol near Interstate 10 in the Van Horn Station area, the agency said.
His partner reported they were both injured and needed assistance. Other agents who responded to their call helped transport the pair to a local hospital.
Mr. Martinez, who has been with the Border Patrol since August 2013, died in the hospital, while his partner remained in serious condition.
Authorities said they are searching the area for potential suspects or witnesses.


Fear American Complacency, Not China
The last time I visited China, I had tea with Deng Xiaoping. It was 1978, and the Chinese leader outlined for me a plan to modernize his country by unleashing its enormous entrepreneurial energies. At the time, I thought his approach seemed pie-in-the-sky.
But today, having just returned from my first visit to China in 40 years, I'm a believer. Back when I met Deng, the number of private automobiles in all of China could be counted in the thousands. Today there are about 200 million. Since 1978, China's economy has grown more than 5,000%, and the disposable income of its citizens has skyrocketed. By 2030, China could surpass the U.S. to become the biggest economy in the world.
The size of China's economy, though, isn't what should worry President Trump. It's China's entrepreneurial dynamism—its intense drive for innovation—that poses the greatest threat to America's economic leadership. No longer a nation of "copycat" industries, China today leads the U.S. in a number of vital sectors, including mobile payments, advanced microchips and artificial intelligence.
More than 10,000 new businesses are registered every day in China. That's seven startups a minute. In the U.S., unfortunately, the entrepreneurial itch seems to have faded. Today barely 8% of all businesses are startups less than a year old, down from roughly 12.5% in 1980. That should concern every American, given that startups are a nation's engine of economic progress, not to mention its primary job creator.
Typical of Chinese business zeal is Xiaomi (sha-oh-mee), the Chinese smartphone maker founded in 2010. It is growing so fast, as Strategy Analytics noted earlier this month, that by next year, "if current momentum continues, Xiaomi could catch or overtake OPPO, Huawei and Apple to become the world's second largest smartphone vendor." (Samsung is the first.) Even more surprising, Alvin Tang, an analyst at Seeking Alpha, suggested in September that Xiaomi should be valued at $69 billion—which would make it the world's most valuable startup, slightly ahead of Uber.


Judge Blocks Pennsylvania's Demand for $200 Million From Insurer
HARRISBURG, Pa.—Pennsylvania's cash-strapped state government has lost round one in its effort to shut down a state-created medical malpractice insurer of last resort if it doesn't hand over $200 million in reserves by Dec. 1.
U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner this week granted a request sought by the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association, suspending the state's deadline until the association's lawsuit can go to trial.
Judge Conner hasn't scheduled a trial date on the association's Nov. 14 lawsuit but said in court papers that he is prepared to expedite a trial. In its lawsuit, the association characterized the state's attempt to take most of its reserves as an unconstitutional nationalization of a nonprofit organization that would "seriously imperil" its ability to make good on its coverage obligations to policyholders.
Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's office said Friday it is considering its options in the case but wouldn't say whether the administration would appeal the judge's decision.
In his decision Wednesday, Judge Conner poured cold water on claims that the association's reserves belong to the state.


As Atlanta Changes, Mayoral Candidates Take on Gentrification
ATLANTA—Joe Meadows has lived in his five-bedroom home in this city's Kirkwood neighborhood since 1966, when he bought it for $10,000.
In the subsequent 50 years, the 83-year-old retired construction foreman has seen his neighborhood transform from predominantly white to largely African-American again. Now it is on its way back to majority-white again.
"I'm not going to be around much longer," said Mr. Meadows, who is black, citing the forces of gentrification that have pushed up property values and driven out many of his black neighbors. "It's all about money, money."
What's happening in Kirkwood is taking place in many neighborhoods across this economic powerhouse of the Deep South. For the first time since at least 1970, Atlanta is on the verge of not being a black-majority city, in part because it has become a magnet for newcomers of all races drawn to a lower cost of living, decent job prospects and warm weather.
Gentrification has become a key issue in the Dec. 5 runoff election for the next mayor. The two candidates vying to lead the city of about 470,000 are both longstanding city council members who ran as nonpartisans. One is Keisha Lance Bottoms, an African-American woman who says she is a Democrat and is backed by Democratic Mayor Kasim Reed. Her rival is Mary Norwood, a white woman who narrowly lost to Mr. Reed in 2009 and who calls herself an independent.


Patents and Property at the Supremes
Can government bureaucrats vitiate private property rights without a jury trial and fair compensation? That's the question the Supreme Court will consider on Monday in what could become a landmark patent case, Oil States Energy v. Greene's Energy.
At issue is the inter partes review that Congress established with the 2011 America Invents Act to curb abusive patent litigation. Owners of low-quality patents—e.g., abstract ideas or processes with broad applicability—extort businesses with infringement lawsuits that are often cheaper to settle than fight. This can deter innovation. Inter partes review allows anyone to challenge a patent at any time. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board, composed of administrative judges appointed by the Commerce Secretary, then decides whether to grant a review and perhaps revoke a patent.
Oil States lost an inter partes review challenge after suing Greene Energy for infringement. The company then claimed that inter partes review violates the Constitution's Article III and the Seventh Amendment because it allows an administrative agency to revoke patents without a jury trial. Article III sets the qualifications for the federal judiciary—that is, judges are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. They also have lifetime tenure. The Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial in suits involving common law such as private property, contracts and trademarks.
Congress has increasingly ceded authority to administrative bodies over disputes involving public rights—those between the government and individuals that don't have a basis in common law. But private rights are strictly the domain of the federal judiciary. This distinction is crucial since Article III judges are intentionally insulated from politics and the two political branches.
Imagine if an Administration official could adjudicate a fraud case between Jeff Bezos and Ivanka Trump. A similar potential for executive abuse and political interference exists with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which lacks the due process and separation-of-powers protections enshrined in Article III. Administrative judges are essentially political appointees with civil service protections. A patent challenger doesn't even have to be a party to a case or controversy to present a claim. Hedge-fund investors have been known to file petitions to invalidate patents prior to short-selling stocks.


New York State Democratic Party Presses Unity Deal on Rebel Faction
The New York state Democratic Party issued an ultimatum to the state Senate's Republican-allied Democratic faction on Monday night: Realign with fellow Democrats or prepare for primaries.
Republicans have since 2012 led New York's Senate in a power-sharing arrangement with a group called the Independent Democratic Conference that broke off from the Democratic conference. The group now has eight members.
Because of that fracture, and another rebel Democrat who separately works with the GOP, the Democrats haven't been able to control the state Senate, despite holding a numerical majority. A Senate majority would give Democrats virtual control of New York's government—they already run the Assembly and hold the governor's seat—at a time when the party's power in the federal government and around the country is weak.
On Monday, after a year of acrimony between two Democratic factions, New York's central Democratic Party floated a unity deal. Under the proposal, Independent Democratic Conference Leader Jeff Klein of the Bronx and Democratic Conference leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers would become co-leaders of the Senate. They could choose each other's deputies, a response to acrimony between Ms. Stewart's current deputy and Mr. Klein, according to a letter signed by the New York Democratic Party leaders.
If the rebel Democrats don't agree to the deal, the "state Democratic Party infrastructure would be prepared to unite in presenting primary challenges" to the IDC, the letter says. The party could also challenge those in the Democratic conference that don't sign on, it says.


Special Counsel Interviewed Kushner About Mike Flynn
Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser and President Donald Trump's son-in-law, was interviewed this month by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as it investigates whether Trump associates colluded in Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, said a person familiar with the matter.
The Mueller team's questions to Mr. Kushner focused on the activities of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, the person said, as it probes Mr. Flynn's ties to Turkey and Russia. The meeting—Mr. Kushner's first known interview with the special counsel's team—lasted less than an hour, the person said.
Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said in a statement, "Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so."
The Kushner interview marks the closest point Mr. Mueller has reached within the president's orbit, said people familiar with the matter. The special counsel has already interviewed current and former top White House officials, including former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and is expected to interview others, including Communications Director Hope Hicks, in the coming weeks. The Kushner interview was first reported by CNN on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump has denied any collusion by him or his campaign, and Moscow has denied meddling in the election.


Yemen's Ex-President Open to Saudi Dialogue, Signaling Rebel Discord
SAN'A, Yemen—Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said he would be open to dialogue with the Saudi-led coalition his forces have been fighting for nearly three years if it ceased fire, as his fighters clashed with Iran-backed Houthis in the capital, signaling disintegration in the rebel alliance.
Mr. Saleh said in a televised interview on Saturday with Yemen al-Youm that he is willing to open a "new page" to deal with the Saudi coalition if it ended its blockade.
The rebel-run Al-Masirah TV quoted a Houthi spokesman as saying that Mr. Saleh's words were "a coup against the alliance and partnership."
Mr. Saleh, who led Yemen for more than 30 years, was deposed after 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that swept the Middle East. The country has since fallen into chaos and Mr. Saleh later joined Houthis to drive his successor as president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, out of the capital in 2014.
The U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition has been fighting to defeat the Houthis along with Mr. Saleh's forces in Yemen since March 2015. The coalition had also imposed a blockade on the country, allowing occasional humanitarian access, with the aim of reinstating the internationally recognized government of Mr. Hadi.


Democrats Call for Al Franken to Resign
WASHINGTON—More than 30 of Al Franken's Democratic colleagues urged him to quit the Senate after the rumble of new sexual-misconduct allegations left the former comic teetering on resignation.
The Minnesota senator's office said he would make an announcement Thursday about his future but pushed back against reports that he had already decided to resign after the avalanche of calls Wednesday for him to step down.
"I think it's important that you walk the walk," Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) said about why wants Mr. Franken to quit. "Talk is fairly cheap around here and so that was the determination in my decision—I made it by myself and not in consultation with anyone else."
Mr. Franken has been accused by several women of groping or forcibly kissing them, during rehearsals or while posing for photos. While denying some of the accusations or saying he remembers the incidents differently, Mr. Franken has also apologized and said he has "let a lot of people down." He has pledged to cooperate with a Senate ethics investigation.
Mr. Franken's statements had kept calls for his resignation at bay in a party that has made women's rights a political priority and has heavily criticized Republican President Donald Trump for his alleged mistreatment of women, which he has denied. But the dam broke Wednesday under the weight of more allegations. First several women senators and then many others said it was time for him to go.


Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Identified as Buyer of Record-Breaking da Vinci
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is leading an austerity drive at home, is the bidder who paid a record $450.3 million for a Leonardo da Vinci portrait of Jesus Christ, settling one of the art world's biggest mysteries.
Prince Mohammed, known by his initials MBS, was identified as the buyer of the 500-year-old painting, "Salvator Mundi," in U.S. intelligence reports, according to people with direct knowledge of the information. American officials have closely watched the activities of the 32-year-old, who is trying to portray himself as a reformer determined to root out corruption in the oil-rich kingdom.
"The image of the crown prince spending that much money to buy a painting when he's supposed to be leading an anticorruption drive is staggering," said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and leading expert on Saudi politics.
Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed, a lesser-known figure and a distant relative of the crown prince, was the nominal winner of the auction, held at Christie's in November, a Middle East art-world figure familiar with the purchase said, "but he is a proxy for MBS."
"It is a fact that this deal was done via a proxy," the person said.


U.S. Warns Saudi Arabia on Mideast Actions as Allies' Ties Fray
The Trump administration delivered an unusually blunt warning to Saudi Arabia on Friday, saying the U.S. might curtail its support for Riyadh's military campaign in Yemen unless the kingdom takes immediate steps to allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged country.
In a series of public comments and private conversations in recent weeks, the Trump administration has urged the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen to lift a blockade on the country to allow food, water, fuel and medicines to reach those in need.
The White House stepped up that call on Friday, saying the U.S. is "gravely concerned by the recent escalation in violence and continued dire humanitarian conditions in Yemen." A senior administration official warned that the situation "could constrain the U.S. if steps aren't taken" to ease the conditions.
The warning came amid the first signs of friction between Riyadh and Mr. Trump. The kingdom publicly criticized the U.S. decision this past week to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move the U.S. Embassy there, calling it an "irresponsible and unwarranted step." Saudi Arabia said the announcement represented a major setback to shared efforts to revive stalled peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Friday for Saudi Arabia to temper its military and diplomatic actions in the Middle East.


Northern California Shooter Who Killed Five Died by Suicide
Authorities now say a gunman who killed five people in rural Northern California last month didn't die from a police bullet.
In a final report Friday, the Tehama County Sheriff's Department said an autopsy determined 44-year-old Kevin Neal shot himself in the head in his car after police forced the vehicle off a road.
Police said Neal killed his wife on Nov. 13 and then went on a shooting rampage in Rancho Tehama Reserve the next day that included firing at an elementary school. He killed four others, including two neighbors, and wounded eight people including a 6-year-old boy.
Authorities said neighbors repeatedly had complained about Neal firing hundreds of rounds from his house and engaging in other erratic and violent behavior.
Family members said he suffered from delusions and mental problems.


An Attack on My Privacy in Wisconsin's Political War
'Elena, I have something I need to tell you." Those were the first words I said to my 29-year-old daughter Wednesday afternoon. I was calling to let her know that according to the Wisconsin Justice Department report released Wednesday, my personal emails, along with approximately 500,000 of those belonging to my colleagues in the Wisconsin Senate and other Republican leaders, were acquired in a John Doe investigation.
The emails had been kept in the Governmental Accountability Board building in a unsecured file called "opposition research." Personal emails with Elena were included, I had learned. Some of our emails even involved discussion of her medical records. These communications didn't belong in the hands of the government but were collected as part of a politically motivated investigation into Gov. Scott Walker.
Under Wisconsin law, prosecutors can ask a judge to authorize a "John Doe" investigation, which is intended to protect the wrongly accused or allow investigators the ability to establish probable cause before filing charges. But in a gross manipulation of the law, in 2012 a liberal judge named Barbara Kluka allowed Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, to conduct a secret investigation into whether Gov. Walker had broken campaign-finance laws. He had not.
Mr. Chisholm weaponized an arm of the government, which was supposed to be Wisconsin's ethics watchdog, to issue broad subpoenas and warrants for documents. The agency even worked with law enforcement to conduct paramilitary raids on people's homes.
These raids and seizures were the result of a mere accusation of campaign-finance violation, for which there was no basis. As it turns out, investigators at the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board took it upon themselves to acquire the personal emails of Republican politicians, including me.


Christopher Wray's FBI Stonewall
Christopher Wray was supposed to bring a new candor and credibility to the FBI after the James Comey debacle, but the country is still waiting. The director's testimony Thursday to the House Judiciary Committee suggests he has joined the Justice Department effort to stop the public from learning about the bureau's role in the 2016 election.
Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte invited Mr. Wray to answer the multiplying questions about the bureau's 2016 political interference. This includes the role that the Steele dossier—opposition research financed by the Clinton campaign—played in the FBI's decision to investigate the Trump presidential campaign. The committee also wants answers about reports that special counsel Robert Mueller demoted Peter Strzok, a lead FBI investigator in both the Trump and Hillary Clinton email investigations, after Mr. Strzok exchanged anti-Trump texts with his mistress, who also works at the FBI.
Mr. Wray spent five hours stonewalling. The director ducked every question about the FBI's behavior by noting that the Justice Department Inspector General is investigating last year's events.
Is Mr. Wray concerned that Mr. Strzok edited the FBI's judgment of Mrs. Clinton's handling of her emails to "extremely careless" from "grossly negligent" in a previous draft? The grossly negligent phrase might have put Mrs. Clinton in legal jeopardy, but Mr. Wray said he couldn't answer because that is subject to the "outside, independent investigation."
Is Mr. Wray taking steps to ensure his top ranks are free of political "taint"? He couldn't say because of the "outside, independent" investigation.


Trump Calls for Overhaul of Immigration System After NYC Attack
President Donald Trump said Monday's attempted terrorist attack is more evidence that the country's immigration system needs a total overhaul to end immigration based on family relationships.
"Today's terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security," Mr. Trump said in a statement.
Akayed Ullah, the suspect, emigrated to the U.S. in 2011 from Bangladesh. He had received a visa for relatives of U.S. citizens and is a legal permanent resident.
The question of "chain migration" has taken on currency among Republicans in recent weeks, with many congressional Republicans suggesting that ending the practice should be coupled with legalization for so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children and are living here illegally.
Mr. Trump said a third version of his disputed travel ban that limits travel to the U.S. for most foreigners from six majority-Muslim countries, North Korea, and government officials from Venezuela is one step to helping ease security concerns. But he added Congress needs to end family-based immigration.


The FBI's Trump 'Insurance'
Democrats and the media are accusing anyone who criticizes special counsel Robert Mueller as Trumpian conspirators trying to undermine his probe. But who needs critics when Mr. Mueller's team is doing so much to undermine its own credibility?
Wednesday's revelations—they're coming almost daily—include the Justice Department's release of 2016 text messages to and from Peter Strzok, the FBI counterintelligence agent whom Mr. Mueller demoted this summer. The texts, which he exchanged with senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page, contain expletive-laced tirades against Mr. Trump. Such Trump hatred is no surprise and not by itself disqualifying. More troubling are texts that suggest that some FBI officials may have gone beyond antipathy to anti-Trump plotting.
"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office—that there's no way [Trump] gets elected—but I'm afraid we can't take that risk," Mr. Strzok wrote Ms. Page in an Aug. 15, 2016 text. He added: "It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40."
What "policy" would that be? The "Andy" in question is Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director. FBI officials are allowed to have political opinions, but what kind of action were they discussing that would amount to anti-Trump "insurance"?
In another exchange that month, Ms. Page forwarded a Trump-related article and wrote: "Maybe you're meant to stay where you are because you're meant to protect the country from that menace." He thanked her and assured: "Of course I'll try and approach it that way." Mr. Strzok, recall, is the man who changed the words "grossly negligent" to "extremely careless" in James Comey's July 2016 public exoneration of Hillary Clinton's emails.


Notable & Quotable: SALT and School Taxes
From "New Jersey School Spending Snub Is a Sign of Tax Bill Effect," a Dec. 13 Bloomberg dispatch:
The sweeping Republican tax bill wending its way through Washington is already rippling out into the heavily taxed suburbs of northern New Jersey.
Residents of Nutley—a town 10 miles west of Manhattan and nestled in a county with one of the nation's biggest property tax bills—voted down a school spending plan on Tuesday meant to build classrooms for overcrowded schools. With an average property tax bill of almost $11,000, voters had little appetite for adding another $300 to the tab, even if it meant their kids may no longer have to learn math and science in a trailer.
For referendum proponents, the vote couldn't have come at a worse time. The GOP revisions take aim at cherished state-and-local-tax deductions, promising to make life more expensive for many in middle-class Nutley, population 28,670. . . . Confusion over how much they'll pay in the new regime had many taxpayers wary of voting themselves an increase. . . .


Deduction Rollback Hurts High-Tax States, But Exodus Isn't Assured
A key provision in the Republican tax plan could dim the appeal of living in high-tax states like New York in favor of low-tax states like Florida.
But research on the subject suggests high-tax regions won't see a sudden or mass exodus. That's because taxes are only one of the many factors that play into where individuals choose to live.
Tax legislation now approaching the finish line in Congress would roll back the deduction that taxpayers enjoy on their federal tax returns for paying state and local tax bills. The latest version would cap the deduction at $10,000.
That's less than the $12,471 average that Americans who took the deduction claimed in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center. Rolling back the deduction would thus raise the cost of living for some taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and California—particularly in urban areas in these states with their own hefty local taxes.
It's one of the largest individual tax breaks in current law. Nearly 30% of tax returns took advantage of the deduction in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center, benefiting many affluent households that itemize rather than take a standard deduction. Limiting it going forward could prompt some of those families to consider relocating to lower-tax areas.


Chileans Cast Ballots in Competitive Presidential Poll
SANTIAGO, Chile—Chileans headed to the polls Sunday in a hotly contested presidential election that many see as a referendum on the moderate establishment that has dominated politics here for nearly three decades.
The second-round runoff pits pro-business billionaire Sebastián Piñera, who was president of Chile from 2010 to 2014, against one-term Sen. Alejandro Guillier, of outgoing President Michelle Bachelet's ruling center-left coalition.
The election comes as Chile's once-dynamic economy is struggling to emerge from a slowdown, while growing demands for education, better pensions and public services have tipped the federal budget into the red. Following a recent shift to the political right in several Latin American countries, Chile also represents an early test of that trend as regional neighbors Colombia, Brazil and Mexico gear up for presidential elections in 2018.
Of the two candidates, Mr. Piñera, who has outlined a broadly pro-growth agenda, is seen by many as the more capable steward of Chile's economy, which slowed markedly in the last four years. But Mr. Guillier, a former television journalist and relative newcomer to politics who plans to move forward with Ms. Bachelet's ambitious social reforms, is seen as more of an outsider at a time when mainstream political parties across the spectrum have lost credibility amid a slew of ethics scandals.
"I hope the new president is, above all, honest," said Maria Teresa Ojedo, a 60-year-old city employee who had just voted in downtown Santiago. "Lately there have been many corruption cases."


Amid Mideast Tension, Pence Again Postpones Planned Trip
WASHINGTON—Vice President Mike Pence's trip to the Middle East has been postponed a second time, his office confirmed on Monday.
Mr. Pence latest change comes after the Trump administration's decision earlier this month to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announce plans to move the U.S. embassy there.
Palestinian officials had scrapped plans to meet with him, and a stop in Egypt faced controversy when the heads of the country's Coptic Church and its al Azhar Mosque said they would not meet with the vice president over the administration's stance on Jerusalem.
Asked whether the Jerusalem announcement has complicated the trip, Mr. Pence's office said the vice president would "reinforce" President Donald Trump's decision when he visits next month. A spokeswoman said the delay until after the holiday season would allow Mr. Pence to spend more time in the region.
"This decision is about making sure millions of Americans get a historic tax cut," said Alyssa Farah, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence. "The vice president is going to the region in just a few weeks and he will reinforce the President's decision on Jerusalem then."


China Delays Move to Blacklist Ships That U.S. Says Aid North Korea
WASHINGTON—China has asked the United Nations Security Council to delay a decision on whether to blacklist 10 ships the U.S. says have violated international sanctions against North Korea, a diplomat said.
A special sanctions committee that reports to the Security Council had been poised Thursday to formally designate the ships as sanctions violators. Such an action would have blocked the vessels from entering the ports of U.N. members.
China, however, formally requested that the decision be postponed until to Dec. 28 so it could have more time to study the proposed list. This is the second time that the Chinese have asked that the decision be deferred.
The issue has emerged as a fresh test of the ability of the U.S. and China to cooperate on North Korea. American officials said that one of the vessels they want the U.N. to designate is owned by a Chinese company. The owners, however, appear to be a diverse group and two of the ships are linked to Taiwanese companies, according to American officials.
American officials have provided declassified intelligence to the panel that shows the ships have breached sanctions by helping to smuggle refined petroleum products to North Korea or transporting North Korean coal to Russia.


A Christmas Encounter With the 'Russian Soul'
As tension with Russia deepens, it may seem as if Americans have little in common with those living under Vladimir Putin's dictatorship. But I have witnessed the triumph of good over evil in Russia many times, including on one striking occasion 25 years ago this month, when an expression of the "Russian soul" defused a dangerous situation and gave me hope for the country's future.
Christmas Eve 1992 was bitter cold in Moscow, and the mood of the city was marked by depression and despair. I was there to complete my first book, "Age of Delirium," about the fall of the Soviet Union.
History was moving rapidly all around me. On the streets, there were rows upon rows of stalls. The capital had turned into a giant bazaar as people sold anything—kitchen utensils, chewing gum, cigarettes, books, icons, heirlooms—to survive.
Yet there were still a few signs of progress, including new public telephones that used prepaid cards. I had a card in my wallet, along with cash and identification, but I had trouble using it in the subzero Russian winter. Once, while making a call, I put the card in my wallet and the wallet on a ledge in the booth. After hanging up, I left the booth having forgotten my wallet. When I returned less than five minutes later, my wallet had disappeared.
Forty-eight hours later, I received a call from "Yuri," who told me that he had my wallet. He claimed it didn't contain any cash when he found it. But he gave me his address and suggested I come see him so the "problem" of my wallet could be "discussed."


Trump's 'Blue Water' Foreign Policy
Most National Security Strategy statements are appallingly platitudinous, numbingly conventional and quickly forgotten. In the history of the U.S. government, no ranking official in a moment of crisis has ended a bitter policy debate by turning to a dog-eared, well-thumbed copy of the current National Security Strategy and saying, "Wait, people! Just calm down! The answer is right here on page 37."
Yet the Trump strategy represents a significant accomplishment. It reconciles the instincts of an unconventional president with the views of a more seasoned and conventional national-security team. The new approach breaks with the conventionally globalist assumptions of American foreign policy and instead embraces an older strategic approach.
As recently as the early 20th century, Britain ruled the waves and took the lead in the construction of a liberal, capitalist world system. During its long reign, two foreign-policy schools faced off over how to engage with Europe. On one side were advocates of a "continental" strategy, which prioritized alliances and close political cooperation with key European states. On the other were advocates of a "blue water" policy, who encouraged Britain to turn away from Europe and toward the open oceans, using its unique global position to maximize its power and wealth.
The bitter fight over Brexit shows that the blue-water-vs.-continentalist divide lives on in British politics. That division also matters in the U.S., Britain's successor as the world's leading naval and commercial power. In contemporary America, continentalists see the Atlantic world, and the thick institutional web that developed among the Cold War allies, as the template on which a peaceful global society can and should be built. From this perspective, the wisest American foreign policy would work through these international institutions and with Western partners to make the rest of the world look more like NATO and the European Union.
The Trump administration hews closer to the blue-water school. In the time of Pax Britannica, blue-water partisans believed Britain could accumulate great strength and wealth by advancing its interests in the wider world. This would do more to keep the country strong and respected than success in the intricate games of European diplomacy, they believed. A strong and rich Britain could always intervene in European politics if necessary to preserve the balance of power, and a globally dominant Britain would always be respected, even if it failed to make itself loved.


Judge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees
SEATTLE—A federal judge on Saturday partially lifted a Trump administration ban on certain refugees after two groups argued that the policy prevented people from some mostly Muslim countries from reuniting with family living legally in the U.S.
U.S. District Judge James Robart heard arguments Thursday in lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and Jewish Family Service, which say the ban causes irreparable harm and puts some people at risk. Government lawyers said the ban is needed to protect national security.
Judge Robart ordered the federal government to process certain refugee applications but said his directive didn't apply to people without a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the U.S.
On Monday, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency was complying with the judge's order. The State Department, which also oversees refugee admissions, is reviewing the judge's order and weighing next steps, including whether to appeal, a spokesman said.
President Donald Trump restarted the refugee program in October "with enhanced vetting capabilities."


He Didn't Build That
According to polls most Americans still don't approve of the job Donald Trump is doing as President. But they have to be impressed by his recent policy achievements. And as Washington ponders a new program to encourage the construction of roads and bridges, the former real-estate developer would seem to have the perfect set of skills and experience to oversee a building boom. To avoid the mistakes of his predecessor, Mr. Trump will need to prioritize the protection of taxpayers.
This week the Journal reports:
Mr. Trump has been touting an overhaul of the nation's infrastructure since his campaign began, and the administration considers it one of its top objectives. The White House is readying a $1 trillion plan that includes direct federal spending of around $200 billion, funds they say that would be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget. The rest of the spending would come from cities, states and private investment.
Voters heard a lot about infrastructure from former President Barack Obama, especially when he first took office. Sold as a way to create jobs while making needed transportation improvements and an environmentally sensitive economy, the stimulus plan was drafted in haste by Democrats in Congress and then signed by Mr. Obama on Feb. 17, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was priced at $787 billion when enacted; the official estimate later soared past $800 billion.
In a 2012 book called "Money Well Spent?," Michael Grabell of the nonprofit news organization ProPublica noted that only about 10% of the spending, or $80 billion, was devoted to infrastructure—and very little of that total went to critical work. The political necessity to fund the "shovel-ready" projects promised by the president meant that money didn't go to the bridges most in need of repair but to jobs that could quickly clear the thicket of regulatory permitting. Repaving roads was a typical activity; less than 12% of the infrastructure spending went for work on bridges.
Even with his report of such modest success, Mr. Grabell may still have overstated the case. In 2014 the Obama White House released its own review of its stimulus program. Writing for the Huffington Post, Philip K. Howard decided to find out how much of the money went to transportation infrastructure, based on Team Obama's own data. According to Mr. Howard:


Trump and Syria After Islamic State
The upper house of the Russian Parliament this week approved a 49-year extension on its naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, another sign of Vladimir Putin's strategic gains from his intervention in Syria's civil war. As the last Islamic State strongholds are defeated in Syria, the big question is whether the U.S. will cede the advantage to Russia and Iran and their client Bashar Assad.
The State Department confirmed recently that Islamic State has lost 95% of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, and the flow of foreign fighters into Syria is slowing. That's the good news.
The bad news is that Mr. Assad remains in power, despite nearly seven years of civil war and two U.S. Presidents and successive Secretaries of State who have called for his ouster. The Syrian dictator's predations have killed more than 400,000 civilians and displaced millions, and he's still torturing, starving and murdering his enemies. The regime has spent most of this month shelling Eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held Damascus suburb, despite a proclaimed Russia-brokered cease-fire.
The Trump Administration hasn't challenged Assad or Russian and Iranian-backed forces directly in offensive operations. Instead, the U.S. has tried to re-establish limited deterrence to prevent those forces from pushing into areas controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that oppose Assad. President Trump blew up a Syrian airfield after a chemical weapons attack in April, and the U.S. military has downed a Syrian aircraft that made incursions into SDF areas. That's fine as far as it goes but it won't change the balance of power in Syria.
Mr. Trump committed in October to roll back Iran's influence in the Middle East, calling Tehran a "fanatical regime." What he does in Syria will show if those words were meaningful, or rhetoric to mask a continuing U.S. retreat from the Middle East as tensions rise between Iran and the Sunni Gulf states.


Two Security Guards Fatally Shot in Las Vegas Hotel-Casino
LAS VEGAS—Two Las Vegas security guards were fatally shot Saturday while investigating a disturbance in a room at a hotel-casino and the alleged shooter is facing critical injuries after turning the gun on himself, police said.
The shooting occurred before 7 a.m. local time at Arizona Charlie's Decatur, which is located west of the Las Vegas Strip. According to police, Christopher Olague, the alleged shooter, ran into a nearby neighborhood after the shooting and tried to enter two homes.
Police found him in a laundry room accessible through a garage of the second home after he appeared to have shot himself in the head, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lt. Dan McGrath said. Police described Mr. Olague's condition as a "non-survivable wound."
Mr. Olague's motive wasn't known, but investigators believe it was an isolated incident.
"I want you to know right now that this has nothing to do with terrorism," Capt. Robert Plummer said outside the scene of the shooting.


Iran's Leaders Face Challenge Over Mounting Protests
Iran's biggest wave of street protests in almost a decade is presenting a mounting challenge to the country's leadership, as demonstrations mushroomed Sunday despite threats of a government crackdown, pushing the president to appeal for calm.
The unrest began Thursday as a rebuke to the economic management of moderate President Hassan Rouhani, whom many Iranians blame for failing to control inflation and fix high unemployment. But protests have widened and have featured chants targeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who sits atop the country's unique form of Islamic government.
Unverified video shared on social media showed unrest Sunday in dozens of cities, from the capital Tehran to Sandanaj and Kermanshah in the west, Isfahan in central Iran and Chabahar in the southeast. There were protests in Mashhad, where demonstrations first broke out Thursday, and in Shiraz in the south.
Some of the videos showed large numbers of people in the streets chanting against Mr. Khamenei and the Iranian system and in some cases clashing with security forces, who at times used batons and water cannons to disperse the crowds. "Death to the dictator!" has been a common refrain.
As has been the case on other days, however, the precise scale of the protests was difficult to judge because reporting on them was limited in state-dominated media, and foreign media access to the country is tightly controlled.


Are Congress's Russia Probes Nearly Done? Depends Which Party You Ask
WASHINGTON—As Congress is set to return from the holiday break, sharp differences have emerged over the next steps in lawmakers' investigations into the Trump 2016 campaign's ties to Russia, with Democrats pushing for more investigative work and Republicans seeking to bring the probes to an end.
The chairmen of the two Republican-run investigations—being conducted by the House and Senate intelligence committees—have expressed confidence in recent interviews that they are in the home stretch of the inquiries. But Democrats on the House panel complain they are being denied the ability to call key witnesses and obtain documents.
The House and Senate probes, looking into whether President Donald Trump or any of his associates colluded with Russia to tilt the 2016 elections, are being conducted for public-accountability purposes. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a criminal investigation into the same matters. That probe has returned several indictments and guilty pleas, including one early last month from Mike Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.
The pace of the House probe accelerated dramatically, with two and sometimes three interviews scheduled a day in the final weeks of 2017, while Senate investigators have only a few dozen witnesses remaining on their list after conducting more than 100 interviews over the past year.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) said he is expected to be done with interviews in his investigation in early 2018. After that, Mr. Burr said he hasn't decided what his committee would do. He said the panel might try to publish a comprehensive report, or it might simply release as much of the information that the committee gathered as possible.


Republicans Can't Avoid ObamaCare in 2018
Republicans failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare in 2017. So what should they do in 2018? Some, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, worry that they won't be able to do much with their 51-49 majority. Others, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, want to give health care another go.
Congress has no choice but to revisit the issue. The growth in spending on health-care entitlements like Medicaid and Medicare threatens to overwhelm the Treasury, starving the federal government of the funds it needs to pay for everything else, including education, welfare and national defense.
Sen. McConnell said last month that any bill to reform entitlements will need to be bipartisan. He's right that getting Republicans and Democrats to cooperate is the most sustainable way to pass such legislation. But with the "resistance" in full swing, bipartisanship may be a pipe dream. On the other hand, if Republicans want to tackle health care alone, they will need to take a different approach from the one that failed in 2017.
First, Republicans need to recognize the limits of their power. Repealing most of ObamaCare's insurance regulations would require 60 votes to break a Democratic filibuster. The recent tax reform passed with 51 votes under the Senate's budget-reconciliation process, but that tactic can be used only on provisions that directly relate to taxing and spending. Further, Republicans are not united on federal health spending and can't muster even 50 votes to pass meaningful reductions. The only way they will get anywhere is if they can make a credible case that their reforms will improve the quality and affordability of health coverage.
Second, Republicans need to understand how the policy landscape has already changed. The tax-reform bill repealed ObamaCare's individual mandate. In October President Trump signed an executive order reviving alternative forms of short-term health insurance. These changes give Americans a reasonable if imperfect escape valve from ObamaCare's costliest regulations.


Islamic State Returns to Guerrilla Warfare in Iraq and Syria
Despite Syrian and Iraqi claims of victory over Islamic State, thousands of militants still holed up in both countries have mounted a number of recent guerrilla-style attacks on civilians and military forces, according to the U.S.-led coalition fighting the extremist group and others.
The fighters, hiding in isolated desert or mountain regions or among civilian populations in the neighboring countries, are stepping up hit-and-run style attacks now that they have lost much of the territory they seized several years ago, according to coalition officials, local activists and other experts.
"Their way of fighting is like a wounded wolf," said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert on Islamic State. "A wolf is the only creature that does not flee when wounded. It attacks."
The U.S.-led coalition warily casts the development as evidence of the group's diminution. "As [Islamic State] continues to lose land, influence, funding streams and conventional capabilities, we expect them to return to their terrorist roots by conducting high-profile attacks on helpless civilians," the coalition said last week. "There are less than 3,000 terrorists, most of whom are being hunted down in desert regions in Syria."
The coalition said its Syrian allies killed more than 20 of the group's militants in November as one of its convoys approached the al-Tanf military base in southeastern Syria, where American forces and allied Syrian fighters are based.


Breitbart Owners Debate Ousting Bannon Amid Trump Feud
President Donald Trump's growing feud with Steve Bannon is threatening the former White House strategist's leadership of the conservative Breitbart News website and upending Mr. Bannon's plans to wage "war" on party incumbents he deemed insufficiently loyal to the White House agenda.
Mr. Bannon's longtime benefactors, billionaires Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, are actively distancing from him even before the expected release this week of a book that has roiled Messrs. Trump and Bannon's relationship, according to two people close to the Mercers.
They and other Breitbart News Network LLC board members on Thursday were debating whether to oust Mr. Bannon as chairman, with many supportive of the move, according to a person familiar with the exchanges. Among the considerations are Breitbart's contractual relationships with other entities, including Sirius XM radio, that involve Mr. Bannon.
Staffers at Breitbart, which Mr. Bannon has called his "killing machine," described a "chaotic" day at the company, with writers—many personally recruited by Mr. Bannon—wondering whether he would last the day.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon has "lost his mind" and that he has "nothing to do with me or my presidency," a response to Mr. Bannon's numerous incendiary comments—including insults about the president's family—in Michael Wolff's book, "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," about the first year of the Trump administration.


Trump Rejects Assertions in Book, Calling Self a 'Very Stable Genius'
President Donald Trump on Saturday continued to assail a new book that features sharp criticism of his administration from close advisers, and lamented what he called the nation's "weak" libel laws that he said allowed the book to be published.
"I consider it a work of fiction, and I think it's a disgrace that somebody's able to .. do something like that," Mr. Trump said at a news conference at Camp David, following the conclusion of a retreat with Republican congressional leaders there. "The libel laws are very weak in this country. If they were strong, it would be helpful—you wouldn't have things like that happen where you can say whatever comes to your head."
The new book, "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," has become a focal point of Mr. Trump's return to Washington this week, following a 10-day Christmas vacation at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.
The author, Michael Wolff, frequented the West Wing during Mr. Trump's first year in office and met with at least a dozen administration officials. The book says White House advisers have had concerns about Mr. Trump's fitness for the presidency, in particular about his "lapses and repetitions." In a Thursday Hollywood Reporter column about his book, Mr. Wolff wrote: "At Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends."
In a flurry of tweets earlier Saturday, Mr. Trump defended himself against questions about his mental fitness, calling himself a "very stable genius."


Trump's Iran Gamble
President Trump said Friday that he's waiving sanctions related to the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal—for the last time. In essence he issued an ultimatum to Congress and Europe to revise the agreement or the U.S. will reimpose sanctions and walk away. His distaste for the nuclear deal is right, but the risk is that Mr. Trump is boxing himself in more than he is the Iranians.
Mr. Trump said in a statement that he is waving sanctions, "but only in order to secure our European allies' agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal." He added: "This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. And if at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately. No one should doubt my word."
That's called a red line, and it means that if his terms aren't met within 120 days, Mr. Trump will have to follow through or damage his global credibility. Presidents should be careful about putting themselves in box canyons unless they have a clear idea of a way out and what his next steps are.
Does Mr. Trump know? It isn't obvious. Mr. Trump rightly focuses on the core faults of the accord: major provisions start sunsetting after 2023; the failure to include Iran's ballistic-missile programs; and inadequate inspections. He wants the European allies that also negotiated the deal—France, Germany and the United Kingdom—to rewrite it with the U.S.
But Iran is sure to resist, and so will China and Russia. French, British and German companies already have billions in business deals invested or being negotiated with Iran, and their political leaders will be loathe to jeopardize them. European leaders have been embarrassingly quiet amid the anti-regime protests in Iran. European Union foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini hosted the foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, France and Iran this week. They expressed support for the deal and said little about Tehran's protest crackdown.


For Newark, Amazon Shortlist Affirms Changes in New Jersey's Biggest City
NEWARK—New Jersey's largest city landed on the shortlist for Amazon.com Inc.'s second headquarters, a distinction local officials said reflected its revitalization but may also be tied to a $7 billion incentive package.
Mayor Ras Baraka said he believes Amazon took notice of the city's proximity to an international airport and the East Coast's busiest seaport as well as its robust fiber-optic network and large pool of college students and other potential workers.
Newark "is not a bus stop, it is a destination and people are beginning to see it as a destination," Mr. Baraka said Thursday.
Newark, which has struggled economically since manufacturing jobs began leaving the city after World War II, has attracted investment from both real-estate developers and corporations in recent years. But the city continues to struggle with poverty and violent crime.
Just days before he left office, former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, signed legislation offering up to $5 billion in tax incentives over 20 years in exchange for Amazon creating as many as 50,000 new jobs over time.


Flu Season Continues to Worsen
The number of people sick with the flu is continuing to climb, and transmission is now the most intense it has been since the 2009 pandemic, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Monday.
The federal agency continued to track and respond to the epidemic despite the government shutdown. Its flu laboratories were working Monday, and "we are continuing to look at data we have received from states so that public-health officials can know about their community and influenza," CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald said in an interview.
CDC officials said earlier this month that they had hoped flu cases were peaking. But the percentage of outpatient visits for flu-like illnesses climbed in the week ending Jan. 13, according to the agency's weekly update, released Friday. The level surpassed every season except 2009-2010, when a new strain of flu to which no one had immunity swept around the world.
The influenza virus behind most infections this year, called H3N2, is notorious for causing bad flu seasons, and the flu is widespread in every state in the continental U.S. The District of Columbia is an exception. H3N2 usually hits the very young and elderly hard; this season, many people between the ages of 50 and 65 are also sick, for reasons that aren't clear. "People in that age range should be very careful to protect themselves from being exposed," Dr. Fitzgerald said.
This season still isn't as severe as 2014-2015, though, when more people were hospitalized from the flu, the CDC said.


Trump Backs Citizenship Pathway for Dreamers
President Donald Trump for the first time said publicly that he supported a pathway to citizenship for young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country by their parents, moving a step closer to bipartisan group seeking a way around an immigration-policy impasse but taking a position at odds with some conservatives.
"We're going to morph into it—it's going to happen," Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. "It's a nice thing to have the incentive after a period of years, being able to become a citizen."
Mr. Trump cited a time frame of 10 to 12 years for the young immigrants, dubbed Dreamers, to become citizens. Mr. Trump last September ended an Obama-era policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that shielded Dreamers from deportation. He gave Congress until March 5 to write the policy into law.
"Tell them not to worry," Mr. Trump said about whether the young immigrants should be concerned that they will be deported if Congress misses a March 5 deadline.
He also indicated he could push back the deadline if Congress hasn't reached a deal. "I might do that," Mr. Trump said. "I'm not guaranteeing it."


Medical Miracles From FDA Inefficiency
Durham, N.C.
You've probably never heard of biallelic RPE65 mutation—and count yourself lucky. It's a genetic defect that causes a form of retinal dystrophy. People born with it gradually lose their vision, often while still children, until they go totally blind. But they are now fortunate: In December the Food and Drug Administration approved a new gene therapy called Luxturna that corrects the mutation and reverses the course of the disease. Patients don't get normal vision back but can read facial expressions and see stars for the first time. It's a partial cure for blindness.
The disease is very rare, afflicting only a few thousand Americans—and therein lies our tale. Spark Therapeutics , which developed Luxturna, charges $850,000 for a course. Even at that high price, a drug with such a small market might not have been economical to develop as recently as a decade ago. This medical miracle was helped along by a federal law enacted in 2007 with bipartisan support—a rare governmental success, for which economist David Ridley deserves much of the credit.
Mr. Ridley, 48, has spent two decades studying and teaching health-care economics at Duke. In 2006 he and two colleagues published a paper in the journal Health Affairs proposing a way to give pharmaceutical companies an incentive to develop treatments for so-called orphan diseases. Congress authorized the "priority review voucher" in 2007. The FDA has since issued 18 vouchers, including six last year: five for drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases and one for the tropical Chagas parasite, which afflicts more than six million people world-wide.
Here's how the system works: When the FDA approves a new treatment for a rare pediatric disease or an infectious tropical one, the drugmaker receives a voucher that can be used to fast-track FDA review on another drug. That allows it to bring the latter drug to market sooner, which can help increase sales, beat competitors and extend the patent's effective lifespan. The vouchers can be sold and never expire. Drugmakers are also required to pay a fee—$2.7 million in 2017—to cover the FDA's cost of expedited review.


The Unseen Toll of a Terror Attack
A burning smell earlier this month on a Bronx subway platform sparked terror for David Wall.
The incident, which turned out to be a routine track fire, reminded him of the December morning when a pipe bomb detonated near him close to the Port Authority bus terminal.
On the Bronx subway platform, Mr. Wall froze. He let six trains pass. He called his wife. "I know nothing is going to go wrong," he told her. "But I just can't."
By some measures, New York got off easy from the attack near the Port Authority on Dec. 11. No one was killed. Four people were injured, including Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi man now accused of carrying out the bombing. Mr. Ullah has pleaded not guilty.
Most New Yorkers went on with their lives, as they have done after earlier terrorist attacks. "This is the most resilient place on Earth, we've proven it time and time again," Mayor Bill de Blasio said that day. "We are going keep being New Yorkers. Let's get back to work."


Gerrymanders: One State Election Tells Little
Patty Schachtner Photo: /Associated Press
Your Jan. 19 editorial "The Wisconsin Gerrymander Lesson" claims that the Democratic victory in a special election for Wisconsin's 10th Senate district "refutes [the] legal case at the Supreme Court for letting judges overturn partisan gerrymanders." That claim is wrong.
Special elections may, in the aggregate, foreshadow results in subsequent elections, but a single result in one state does not. Drawing such a sweeping conclusion on the basis of the result in the 10th is no more valid than believing that Doug Jones's defeat of Roy Moore in the recent U.S. Senate special election proves that Alabama is now a blue state.
The 2011-12 recall elections in Wisconsin—in which Democratic candidates defeated three incumbent Republican state senators to take temporary control of the chamber—also didn't mean that the Democrats would win legislative majorities in November 2012. In fact, Democrats won over 53% of the statewide two-party presidential vote in 2012, and 168,000 more votes than Republicans in Assembly races, but wound up with only 39% of Assembly seats. As the three-judge panel recognized in Gill v. Whitford, that is the harm of a partisan gerrymander. Keith Gaddie, the consultant who helped Republicans draw the map, concurred. Barry C. Burden Kenneth R. Mayer University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison, Wis.


Cyprus President Leads First-Round Vote, Heads to Runoff
Incumbent Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades was the top finisher on Sunday's first round of presidential elections, but failed to garner a majority of votes needed to avoid a runoff.
The conservative leader will face Stavros Malas, an independent candidate backed by Communist party AKEL, in a runoff on Feb. 4. Mr. Anastasiades was leading all the opinion polls in the run-up to the vote. He said that this second 5-year term in office would be his last if he is re-elected.
Mr. Anastasiades secured a 35.5% support while Mr. Malas was backed by 30.2% of voters. Centrist Nicos Papadopoulos was third with 25.7% and Christos Christou of the far-right party ELAM got 5.7%. About 28% of the Cypriots abstained from voting.
The 71 year-old Mr. Anastasiades is credited with leading the country's economy back to growth after it nearly collapsed in 2013 and for leading talks to bring the divided island closer than it has been in more than four decades.
Cyprus's €10 billion ($12.43 billion) bailout program was launched in 2013, when Cypriot banks collapsed and the country had to impose capital controls to prevent a complete financial meltdown. Things began acrimoniously when Germany and the International Monetary Fund forced Cyprus to inflict losses on bank depositors to help pay for the rescue.


FBI Urges White House Not to Release Contested Memo on 2016 Campaign
WASHINGTON—The FBI publicly urged President Donald Trump not to release a classified memo, escalating a simmering dispute over Republican allegations of improper surveillance in the probe examining whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
In a sign of the unusual public tension between the intelligence agency and the president, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a statement Wednesday after FBI Director Christopher Wray tried privately to persuade the White House to keep the memo under wraps. The document is a summary of classified information written by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.
"The FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it," the bureau's statement said. "We have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy."
Friction between a U.S. president and FBI isn't unusual. But rarely has a president clashed as repeatedly and as publicly with the intelligence agencies as Mr. Trump.
In his first year in office, Mr. Trump described the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election a hoax and wrote on Twitter that the FBI's "reputation is in tatters." He fired then-FBI Director James Comey last spring and is now in a public dispute with Mr. Comey's successor, Mr. Wray, whom he handpicked to lead the agency.


FBI Knew of New Clinton Emails Weeks Before Alerting Congress
Top FBI officials were aware for at least a month before alerting Congress that emails potentially related to an investigation of Hillary Clinton had emerged during a key stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to text messages reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had learned about the thousands of emails by Sept. 28, 2016, and Director James Comey informed Congress about them on Oct. 28, 11 days before the presidential election, the messages show. Mr. Comey later said nothing in the new emails had changed the Federal Bureau of Investigation's decision that Mrs. Clinton had committed no prosecutable offenses.
That lag is one focus of an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general, or in-house watchdog, into a variety of FBI actions in advance of the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe stepped down this week, and FBI Director Christopher Wray in a note to bureau employees announcing Mr. McCabe's departure also said he wouldn't comment on the inspector-general probe. The Washington Post first reported the inspector general's interest in the time lag.
Mr. McCabe has declined to comment on his departure and the inspector-general investigation.
In the text messages reviewed by the Journal, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe into Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, told FBI lawyer Lisa Page on Sept. 28 that he had just been summoned to speak to Mr. McCabe about the newly discovered emails.


Shooting at Los Angeles Middle School Is Called Accidental
A school shooting in Los Angeles on Thursday that injured five people was accidental, police said.
A 12-year-old girl was taken into custody after she allegedly fired a weapon at Salvador Castro Middle School near downtown Los Angeles, seriously injuring two students. A 15-year-old boy was shot in the head but survived, and a 15-year-old girl was hit in the wrist. The teens were hospitalized. The others had minor injuries.
Investigators believe the shooting was an accident, a Los Angeles police spokesman said late Thursday. The girl was booked for negligently discharging a firearm.
A 13-year-old student told the Los Angeles Times that someone was playing with a gun they believed to be fake.
"As a parent, this is everyone's worst-case nightmare," said Robert Arcos, a deputy chief with the Los Angeles Police Department.


Law Firm Representing Kushner Appoints Public-Relations Veteran
The law firm representing senior White House adviser Jared Kushner has hired a veteran of prior White House investigations to handle press relations for the firm's clients.
Abbe Lowell of Norton Rose Fulbright, a lawyer representing Mr. Kushner and other high-profile clients, has hired Peter Mirijanian, who has run his own public-relations firm for more than 10 years, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Mirijanian wasn't hired to work specifically on Mr. Kushner's case, the person said.
Mr. Mirijanian once handled media relations for Jack Quinn, a lawyer and former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton who represented Marc Rich, the financier who was then seeking a pardon from the White House.
Mr. Lowell had been trying to hire someone to handle press calls regarding Mr. Kushner since late last year, and had been turned down by at least two other firms, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Lowell has a number of high-profile clients besides Mr. Kushner. He also represents Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), whose trial on federal corruption charges ended in a hung jury in November. U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday they wouldn't retry the senator.


GOP Senators Add to Questions About Dossier Author Steele
Two Republican senators allege the author of a controversial dossier lied to federal agents, or the Justice Department knowingly or mistakenly permitted "materially false statements" to appear in classified records, according a criminal referral from the lawmakers released on Monday.
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made the allegations in a written referral they sent last month to the Justice Department seeking a criminal investigation of the dossier's author, Christopher Steele.
The letter doesn't specify which classified records it is referring to, but later correspondence suggests it involves material from Mr. Steele that the Justice Department included in a surveillance application it submitted to a judge in 2016 to secretly monitor a former Trump campaign adviser.
The Justice Department has said it received the senators' letter and is reviewing it. Mr. Steele's attorney didn't respond to a request for comment.
A heavily redacted version of the senators' letter was released Monday, following the disclosure last week by the House Intelligence Committee of a Republican-authored memo asserting that improper bias had infected the Justice Department's investigation of ties between associates of President Donald Trump and the Russian government.


Tehran Orders Ailing 81-Year-Old Iranian-American Back to Prison
NEW YORK—Iran's judiciary ordered an 81-year-old Iranian-American detainee to return to prison on Tuesday, even though the government medical examiner's office recommended his medical leave be extended because of his poor health.
Baquer Namazi's family and lawyer said returning him to prison from temporary medical leave was tantamount to a death sentence and represented "a spectacular display of cruelty."
"Risking the life of my father is reckless and irresponsible," said Babak Namazi, speaking to reporters from Washington, where he plans to meet with officials in the Trump administration to press for efforts to gain the release of his father and brother, Siamak, also an American citizen detained in Tehran.
U.S. officials denounced the government's move.
"We are deeply disturbed that the Iranian government has returned Mr. Namazi to prison," said Steve Goldstein, under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. "We are concerned about his declining health and he remains in urgent need of sustained medical care. We continue to call for his unconditional release from his unjust detention in Iran."


Who Is Christopher Steele?
America has been inundated by the words dossier, memo, collusion, FISA, Carter Page. They all come back to the actions of one man: Christopher Steele. Which is why the only news that matters this week is that the former British spy's credibility has been dismantled.
To the extent the U.S. press has focused on Mr. Steele, it has been to portray him in heroic epic style. A Washington Post profile told how Mr. Steele, a former MI6 agent who left in 2009 to start his own firm, felt "professional obligations" to take his dossier to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That's how "worried" and "rattled" and "alarmed" he was about the Trump-Kremlin "plot." The FBI welcomed this "well-trusted" source, who had provided information in the past, as a "peer"—only later to let our hero down.
This is the narrative put forward by Mr. Steele and his paymaster, Fusion GPS. They and their press friends have an obvious interest in propagating it. But the new facts about Mr. Steele's behavior destroy this tale, and show how badly the FBI got snookered.
To be sure, the FBI should have known better. Even if Mr. Steele had previously been helpful, the bureau had every reason to be wary in 2016. This wasn't like prior collaborations. He was coming to the FBI as a paid political operative, hired by Fusion, as a subcontractor for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Opposition researchers are not retained to present considered judgment. They are retained to slime an opponent and benefit a client.
The FBI also had reason to view his research with skepticism—on grounds of its tabloid-like allegations, and also on the near-fantastical claim of skill that underlay it. To wit, that a man who had been out of official spy rings for seven years was nonetheless able, in a matter of weeks and with just a few calls from London, where he lives, to unravel an international conspiracy that had eluded the CIA, FBI, MI6 and every other Western intelligence agency, all of which have access to the globe's most sophisticated surveillance tools.


FDNY Aims to Boost Women, Minorities in Its Ranks
The New York City Fire Department commissioner said he wants more than 50% of firefighters to be minority and 15% to be women in 12 years—a sharp uptick from current levels.
Commissioner Daniel Nigro revealed the benchmarks during questioning from City Council Speaker Corey Johnson during a hearing on diversity in the fire department held by the council's new committee on fire and emergency management. The department has long been criticized for its lack of minorities and women, which has resulted in multiple lawsuits over the years.
"The FDNY is simply out of step with other city agencies..when it comes to diversity," Mr. Johnson said.
The first-term council speaker pressed Mr. Nigro on whether the lack of minorities and women created a culture that discouraged them, even those who passed an entry exam, from joining the department.
"One cannot deny it is difficult to convince the thousands of women in our city who are capable of doing the job of a firefighter that it is a career they would enjoy," Mr. Nigro said. "We do believe that there is a tipping point."


It's Too Hard to Search the Cloud
Conflicts of law in cyberspace have grown worse in recent years. Multinational technology companies now regularly fight costly legal battles with the U.S. government. Both sides want to know: Can a U.S. warrant compel the disclosure of data stored abroad and subject to foreign law? Whose law takes precedence? What can be done to prevent such conflicts?
A significant increase in the use of cloud services has also made the situation more complicated. Data once physically stored in a filing cabinet is now on a server located anywhere in the world. Mail once in a desk drawer is now "shredded" into thousands of pieces spread across servers in multiple countries. The details of people's lives, earlier confined to their homes and offices, are spread around the globe.
Foreign governments naturally take interest in this data. They often have legitimate reasons to compel service providers to turn over information stored abroad, especially when it is relevant to a criminal investigation. But legal conflicts between countries also create perverse incentives. Some countries may pursue unfettered access to data stored abroad while requiring their own citizens' data to stay within their borders.
What does this balkanized internet look like in practice? Companies subject to competing legal demands must choose which country's law they will violate. Deciding where to locate servers becomes a matter of legal gamesmanship rather than technological efficiency. The outlook for such an internet is grim.
Writing in these pages three years ago, I called for an international rule of law for cloud data. Last week, a bipartisan group in Congress took the first step in building such a system. The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act—or Cloud Act—seeks to resolve these conflicts of law while balancing them with the legitimate investigatory needs of law enforcement.


The Deficit Problem in a Chart
The White House released the President's $4.4 trillion budget request for fiscal 2019 on Monday, and talk about an afterthought. Congress just passed a two-year budget outline that supersedes nearly everything Mr. Trump is proposing.
Congress still must work out the details in spending bills, and perhaps appropriators will grab a Trump request or two, which include everything from a border wall to cuts to food stamps to a plan for spinning off air-traffic control. The President also wants $200 billion in infrastructure spending (see nearby) over 10 years, though this seems politically unlikely now that the GOP has shoveled $20 billion on public works for two years and annual deficits may exceed $1 trillion.
The most important thing to understand about the U.S. budget, Donald Trump or no, is illustrated by the nearby chart. Even with Mr. Trump's modest increases, defense barely rises as a share of federal outlays. In 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell, defense was 26.5% of outlays. In 2019 it will be 15.6%.
Meantime, look at "payments for individuals," which encompass such income transfers as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and food stamps, among other things. This category was 47.7% of outlays in 1989 and has steadily climbed to reach an estimated 69.2% in 2019.
Net interest on the federal debt soaks up another 7.4% of outlays for 2018, and that will rise with interest rates. But as long as Donald Trump and Democrats refuse to reform entitlements, whining about debt and deficits is phony. Defense hawks like John McCain have a compelling case that troops have been denied adequate resources to defend the country, and the giant sucking sound in the federal fisc isn't defense. It's the relentless rise of income transfers.


Trump's Budget Proposal Projects Big Jump in Deficits
President Donald Trump released Monday a $4.4 trillion budget proposal that would boost spending for the military and border security, cut many domestic programs and projects deficits through the next decade.
The blueprint underscores what has become clear in recent months: that the budget austerity Republicans pursued in 2011 has ended. GOP lawmakers and Mr. Trump are now pursuing fiscal policies that tolerate wider deficits in a bid to ramp up economic growth.
Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that the proposal shows Mr. Trump has—for now—given up on balancing the budget over the next decade. But he said he hoped it would send the message, "We do not have to have trillion-dollar deficits forever."
The GOP president's proposed budget, an annual document that outlines the priorities of the administration, doesn't balance over a decade in large part because, even with slightly stronger economic growth, it projects the government will collect less federal revenue than it forecast last year. That is because of the $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted in December.
One result is the document projects a budget deficit next year that is nearly double what his proposal estimated last year.


Pakistan, Seeing New Pressure from the West, Moves Against Militant Group
Pakistan is hoping to head off an attempt by the Trump administration to exert further pressure over terrorism by putting the country on a global terror financing watch list, according to a senior Pakistani official.
Miftah Ismail, adviser to the country's prime minister and Pakistan's de facto finance minister, said that the country had in recent days undertaken a wide-ranging crackdown on the Jamaat-ud-Dawa group, which also is known as JuD and is blamed by the United Nations for the 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai, which killed 166 people.
Washington has pressed Pakistan to take action against Islamist militants on its soil, and blamed the country for giving sanctuary to Afghan insurgents, announcing last month that it is withholding $2 billion in security assistance.
The international Financial Action Task Force, meeting in Paris next week, will consider a proposal by the U.S., co-sponsored by the U.K. and other Western governments, to put Pakistan on a list of countries that don't comply with international regulations to squeeze financing of terrorist groups, said Mr. Ismail.
U.S. officials wouldn't confirm that it had proposed Pakistan for the terror financing watch list, saying the process was confidential.


Jacob Zuma Steps Down as South Africa's President
JOHANNESBURG—South African President Jacob Zuma bowed to intense pressure and resigned, ending a nine-year tenure that dragged the liberation party of Nelson Mandela into a series of political and financial crises that inflicted severe harm on Africa's most-developed economy.
Wednesday's announcement, made on live television just hours after Mr. Zuma said he was resisting his African National Congress party's orders to relinquish his office, came as police units launched dawn raids to arrest some of the president's allies.
Mr. Zuma's resignation leaves the ANC—the party that defeated white-minority rule and whose message of reconciliation and unity spurred South Africa's image as the "Rainbow Nation"—one year until national elections to win back its core constituency.
That task will fall to Mr. Zuma's deputy and new ANC leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, a former union leader who became one of Africa's richest men before returning to politics. Many poor and black voters have been disappointed by the party's failures to end racial inequality and a sense that its leadership was more concerned with its own enrichment than improving the lives of its people.
"Even though I don't agree with the decision of my organization, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC," Mr. Zuma, a 75-year-old former ANC spymaster who spent years in prison on Robben Island with Mr. Mandela, said at the end of a lengthy television address on Wednesday.


Responding to Parkland
Add 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz to the list of disturbed young men who have committed mass murder against other young men and women in their communities. A partial list of these awful incidents includes Chris Harper-Mercer at Oregon's Umpqua Community College; Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook school; James Holmes in Aurora, Colo.; Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson; and Cho Seung-Hui, who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007.
All these events have two things in common: guns and mental illness. From that fact flows the demand, every time, that we "do something." Saying it, however, is not the same as doing something that would in fact mitigate this recurrent carnage. Doing something in our system inevitably means putting in motion an array of actors toward this goal—elected or appointed public officials, the police, the medical community and not least parents.
Guns first. When a Parkland happens, the liberal half of America's politics puts forth the same two-word solution: gun control. There is a simple causality to this argument—fewer guns, fewer murders. Always left out is evidence it would work.
Gun-control laws—for example, to regulate bump stocks, AR-15s or ammunition magazines—foundered because advocates have never offered credible evidence they would deter mass shootings. Because gun proponents believe, not without reason, that the left's ultimate goal is confiscation, the political prospects for a gun control solution have been and will remain about zero.
On Thursday the gun-control side pointed to President Trump's signing of a bill last year revoking an Obama rule requiring the Social Security Administration to forward to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System the names of disability recipients who need a third party to help them manage their benefits because of a mental impairment. But this overly broad Obama rule was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union and National Rifle Association.


U.K. Wants Ongoing Defense Cooperation With EU After Brexit
MUNICH, Germany—U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Saturday laid out key areas of security and defense cooperation she hoped to continue with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc next year.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mrs. May said Britain and the EU should move quickly to ensure continued common extradition and arrest structures, intelligence and data exchanges after it leaves the bloc, due in March 2019.
She called for an unprecedented future security treaty between the U.K. and the bloc, which would also ensure ongoing cooperation on sanctions, foreign policy and British participation in EU defense structures.
"The challenge for all of us today is finding the way to work together, through a deep and special partnership between the U.K. and the EU, to retain the cooperation that we have built and go further in meeting the evolving threats we face together," she said.
The EU has warned that Britain would drop out of structures such as Europol and the European Arrest Warrant once it leaves the bloc. Even during an expected transition, which could last for two years after March 2019, the bloc has said Britain will be blocked from new pan-European security systems.


Why America Is Going Broke
The federal deficit is big and getting bigger. President Trump's budget estimates a deficit of nearly $900 billion for 2018 and nearly $1 trillion (with total spending of $4.4 trillion) for 2019. Its balance sheet reveals that the public debt will reach $15.7 trillion by October. This works out to $48,081.61 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. That doesn't count unfunded liabilities, reported by the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, that are four times the current public debt.
How did the federal government's finances degenerate this far? It didn't happen overnight. For seven decades, high tax rates and a growing economy have produced record revenue, but not enough to keep pace with Congress's voracious appetite for spending. Since the end of World War II, federal tax revenue has grown 15% faster than national income—while federal spending has grown 50% faster.
While most Americans are aware of the budgetary importance of entitlements, the accompanying chart clarifies the magnitude of the problem. It shows the importance of entitlements in determining past and present budget trends, and where they will take us if Congress fails to reform them.
The chart shows federal spending relative to gross domestic product since World War II, broken into three categories. Entitlements are depicted in red. This includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, disability insurance, food stamps and a host of other welfare programs. National defense is shown in blue. All other nondefense spending is in yellow. Interest on the public debt isn't included. Because of currently low rates, interest payments amount to less than half what the government spends on all other nondefense programs.
As the chart makes clear, all—yes, all—of the increase in federal spending relative to GDP over the past seven decades is attributable to entitlement spending. Since the late 1940s, entitlement claims on the nation's output of goods and services have risen from less than 4% to 14%. Surprising as it may seem, the share of GDP that is spent on national defense and nondefense discretionary programs combined is no higher today than it was seven decades ago.


After Boko Haram Raid, Nigerians Try Again to Bring Girls Back
DAPCHI, Nigeria—Garba Sule was preparing for evening prayers when heavily armed Boko Haram jihadists rode into town last week in pickup trucks, firing hundreds of rounds into the air and demanding directions to the local girls' school.
The camouflage-clad militants loaded up dozens of students from the Dapchi Government Girls Science and Technical College and drove them into the surrounding scrubland, according to eyewitnesses, schoolteachers and local officials. Among them: Mr. Sule's 13-year-old daughter, Zara.
A week after the Feb. 19 attack, 110 schoolgirls from this remote town in northeastern Nigeria remain unaccounted for, stunning Africa's most populous nation and rekindling memories of Boko Haram's seizure of 276 girls from Chibok Government Secondary School in 2014.
That earlier attack, initially ignored by Nigeria's government, ultimately prompted a global activist movement—#BringBackOurGirls. About half of the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls either escaped or were ransomed; 112 remain missing. At least 13 are presumed dead. Boko Haram continues to hold thousands of abducted boys and girls.
The latest episode has sparked outrage across Nigeria, where public anger has focused on authorities who initially refused to acknowledge the incident and then incorrectly claimed to have rescued the girls.


High Court Deals Setback to Trump Immigration Policy
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court dealt a setback to President Donald Trump's immigration policy on Monday, declining to take up an administration appeal that sought a quick end to the Obama-era program protecting young, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.
The high court's action, which effectively requires Mr. Trump to finish litigating in the lower courts first, means that hundreds of thousands of program recipients may continue to renew their protections while legal challenges continue, a process that could take another year or longer.
The court's action also relieves pressure on Congress, which has struggled to find a legislative replacement for the program begun by former President Barack Obama.
In September, Mr. Trump announced that the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would end on March 5. But two lower-court judges have issued injunctions blocking that plan for now and ordered administration officials to continue to process renewals, so Congress doesn't face an imminent deadline.
The court's action Monday was a rejection of an unusual request by the Justice Department, which had asked the justices to intervene now, even though appeals courts haven't yet ruled on the cases.


To Fix the House, Start With the Speaker
The House of Representatives has become a tyranny of the majority. Speakers use their control of the Rules Committee to protect their party members from tough votes and to ensure that as many factions as possible within their party are comfortable with bills that reach the floor. Members of the minority party have virtually no say in the proceedings. As a result, the lower chamber is the place bipartisan proposals go to die.
It doesn't have to be this way, and the upcoming midterm elections offer an opportunity for change. Longtime observers of congressional races believe that when the dust settles in November, the victorious party will have only a slim majority, probably fewer than 10 seats. If so, members determined to create space for bipartisan legislation would be able to use their leverage by withholding their votes for the majority's candidate for speaker until the candidate agrees to support reforms in the way the House does business.
This strategy, championed by the nonpartisan group No Labels (which I helped found), could play out in a number of ways. For example, the holdouts could demand an end to "closed" rules that prevent members from offering floor amendments to contested bills; they could ban the consideration of legislative language that members have not had a chance to read and ponder; they could insist that both parties be represented in conference committees.
Such an approach would not be without precedent. After the midterm election of 1922, the Republicans were left with a narrow majority of 225 seats. A small band of Republican progressives refused for eight ballots to support Frederick Gillett, their party's anointed candidate for speaker, until he agreed to a package of procedural reforms prior to the ninth.
Re-enacting this drama in January 2019 would be a big step forward. But today's House reformers have the option of going even further by turning the office of speaker into a force for bipartisanship. As things now stand, successful candidates need only a simple majority of members present and voting for a candidate. Suppose that the threshold were raised to 60%. Unless one party enjoyed such a supermajority, a candidate of the majority could become speaker only with the support of a portion of the minority party. Alternatively, the overall threshold for the election of the speaker could be left as a simple majority, with a new proviso requiring support from at least 10% of the minority.


Xi Jinping's Ideological Ambitions
Xi Jinping isn't going anywhere. This week the Chinese Communist Party proposed amending the country's constitution to abolish presidential term limits. Under the current rules, Mr. Xi is due to step down in 2023, after two terms. Once that formal constraint is eliminated, there will be nothing to stop him from staying in office however long he likes—as the Communist Party's chief and China's president.
Behind this news, sidelining constitutional restraints is a deeper trend: Under Mr. Xi's leadership, the Communist Party is devouring China's governing institutions while promoting its ideology for export like never before. Mr. Xi's message to the world is that autocracy is a viable system of government. That makes China not only an economic and security rival for the U.S. but an ideological one.
If such a change isn't obvious, that may be because the old habits of Leninist secrecy die hard. The Communist Party's powerful departments that control personnel and policy still do not list their phone numbers or display signs outside their offices. Likewise, the party continues to enforce a strict code of silence about its internal operations.
But elsewhere the party has become more open about its grip on business and society. To take one example, Chinese state companies listed abroad have long filed misleading prospectuses that omitted the party's pivotal role in their operations, including the hiring and firing of senior executives. Recently Beijing reversed course. Some state companies listed in Hong Kong now include in their articles of association a broad description of the party's role in "managing the overall situation." The meaning of this change is clear: Power over corporate decisions and personnel that the party used to wield behind the scenes can now be exercised explicitly.
Meanwhile, the party has solidified its formerly haphazard effort to establish cells inside large Chinese private enterprises, as well as within foreign companies and joint ventures operating inside China. Any substantial private company, whether local or foreign, is now expected to include party cells.


De Blasio Names Schools Chief
Mayor Bill de Blasio tapped the superintendent of Houston schools to be the next New York City schools chancellor, days after the mayor's first choice pulled out.
Richard Carranza, 51 years old, will succeed Carmen Fariña, 74, who is retiring at the end of the month. In a press conference Monday at City Hall, Mr. Carranza said he hadn't visited New York much, but described his views as closely aligned with the mayor's on education, the need to protect immigrants and the rejection of any proposals to arm teachers with guns.
''There is no daylight between Mayor de Blasio and myself in terms of what we believe in or what our aspirations are for the children of New York City," Mr. Carranza said.
The announcement Monday came after Miami-Dade County Public Schools superintendent Alberto Carvalho rejected the city's offer after initially accepting it, to the embarrassment of City Hall.
Mr. Carranza, a lifelong educator, alluded to that drama by saying he was thrilled to have the chance to lead a system of 1.1 million children. "My word is my bond, we shook hands," he said. "I'll be in New York City as long as you'll have me."


Administration Joins States in Push for Online Sales Taxes
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration on Monday urged the Supreme Court to expand states' authority to collect sales tax on internet transactions, joining a chorus of state officials seeking to overrule a 1992 precedent exempting many online retailers from having to add taxes to a consumer's final price.
In 1992, the justices "did not and could not anticipate the development of modern e-commerce," Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a friend-of the-court brief. "In light of internet retailers' pervasive and continuous virtual presence in the states where their websites are accessible, the states have ample authority to require those retailers to collect state sales taxes owed by their customers."
South Dakota is leading a charge to overrule 1992 case, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, with arguments scheduled next month. Some 35 states and the District of Columbia, as well as organizations representing retailers from booksellers to shopping malls, have filed briefs supporting South Dakota's position. Catalog mailers and online retailers have opposed the state, arguing that it is too burdensome for many businesses to comply with 50 or more separate state taxing regimes.
The 1992 case held that constitutional provisions assigning Congress authority over interstate commerce prohibited states from requiring out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes without congressional assent. While consumers remain obligated to pay sales tax, few know of this duty and fewer still voluntarily comply, robbing state treasuries of billions of dollars, officials say.
Conventional retailers also complain that the Quill precedent puts them at a disadvantage with online competitors, which can effectively sell products tax-free.


Congress Is Fighting Online Sex-Trafficking
Your March 3 editorial "Political Sex-Trafficking Exploitation" misses the mark on the bipartisan effort under way in Congress to help stop online sex trafficking. Courts across the country have consistently ruled that the Communications Decency Act, enacted in 1996 when the internet was in its infancy, grants immunity to websites that knowingly support and profit from the selling of women and children online. Congress never intended to create this blanket immunity, but the courts have made clear their hands are tied.
The narrowly crafted solution recently passed overwhelmingly by the House and soon up for debate in the Senate simply ends that immunity, and it gives victims the opportunity to get the justice they deserve if they can prove that a website knowingly assisted, supported or facilitated this heinous crime. That's a high bar to meet that both preserves internet freedom while holding bad actors accountable. In fact, our legislation preserves the current law's "Good Samaritan" provision, which protects websites that proactively screen for offensive material. Our narrow focus is why this bill has such broad-based support from the White House, advocates, law enforcement, so many in the tech community and members of Congress on the right and left.
Ironically, the Communications Decency Act was originally intended to protect children from indecent material on the internet by holding liable users who send explicit material to children. Now, traffickers are using the same law as a shield to operate online with immunity. Your editorial says Congress should "pass legislation clarifying that Section 230 was never intended to shield websites that actively facilitate crime." That's what our bill does. Let's fix this injustice.

Trump Looks at Wall Prototypes, Attacks California's Governor
SAN DIEGO—President Donald Trump Tuesday got a look at the border wall he has touted for nearly three years, inspecting prototypes that he hopes will be a model for hundreds of miles of barrier separating the U.S. from Mexico.
He also escalated his administration's battle with the state of California, which has repeatedly challenged his immigration policies in court and elsewhere. Mr. Trump said longtime Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown is doing "a terrible job." Noting that he owns property in the state, Mr. Trump said taxes were double or triple what they should be.
Mr. Brown responded to Mr. Trump on Twitter: "Thanks for the shout-out.. But bridges are still better than walls. And California remains the 6th largest economy in the world and the most prosperous state in America. #Facts."
Examining various wall designs, Mr. Trump didn't pick a favorite, and Homeland Security officials say the winning bidder will be chosen through the normal government acquisition process. But the president did complain because six of the eight samples aren't see-through, which he said would be a problem for the Border Patrol trying to assess activity.
"You have to have see-through," he said. "You have to know what's on the other side of the wall." DHS had directed contractors to build at least half the prototypes out of solid concrete.


Navy Jet Crashes Off Key West, Two Crew Members Killed
WASHINGTON—A U.S. Navy jet fighter crashed Wednesday off the coast of Key West, Fla., killing its two crew members.
The F/A-18 Super Hornet was approaching land at the naval air station at about 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. It crashed into the water about a mile east of the runway.
The pilot and weapons-system officer ejected and were recovered, but U.S. Naval Air Forces reported late Wednesday night that both died. Their names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The cause of the crash is under investigation.
The aircraft crew is based out of Naval Air Station Oceana, in Virginia Beach, Va. The Super Hornet is a twin-engine jet fighter that is larger than the single-seat F/A-18 Hornet.


The Pyongyang-Tehran Axis
Defying precedent and conventional wisdom, President Trump says he'll meet in May with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Mr. Trump wants a sustainable deal that leads to North Korean denuclearization. The president's critics scoff, and even his supporters are rightly skeptical. But Mr. Trump has conditions: His policy of maximum sanctions pressure will remain in place, Pyongyang must commit to the goal of denuclearization upfront, and it must refrain from missile or nuclear tests during talks. That may give him some leverage.
But if there's one thing that would help Mr. Trump to succeed, it's fixing the fatally flawed nuclear deal with Iran. The Iran-North Korea axis dates back more than 30 years. The two regimes have exchanged nuclear expertise, cooperated widely on missile technologies, and run similar playbooks against Western negotiators. The fear: Tehran is using Pyongyang for work no longer permitted under the 2015 nuclear deal while perfecting North Korean-derived missile delivery systems back home.
Iran and North Korea both began their pursuit by acquiring designs and materials from Pakistan's infamous A.Q. Khan proliferation network. Reports of more extensive cooperation haven't been confirmed: Iran reportedly sent its nuclear chief, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, to a North Korean nuclear test in 2013. Last summer North Korea's second-highest-ranking official reportedly visited Iran for 10 days. In early 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Pyongyang and Tehran could be cooperating to develop a nuclear weapon.
Missile cooperation is extensive. Iran's Shahab-3 nuclear-capable ballistic missile, whose 800-mile range means it can hit Israel, is based on North Korea's Nodong missile. The 1,200-mile-range Khorramshahr missile, which Iran showed off last year, was derived from North Korea's BM-25
For years Iran watched Pyongyang play the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations to advance its nuclear and missile programs. The Kim regime demonstrated how a relatively weak country could persuade the U.S. to yield on major concessions along a patient pathway to nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.


New York-Area Students Protest Gun Violence, Some Risking Punishment
More than 1,000 teenagers at Stuyvesant High School in New York City marched to an athletic field chanting "Grades up, guns down."
At P.S. 321 in Brooklyn, fifth-graders tied orange ribbons onto a fence spelling "No Place for Hate."
And at a high school in Sayreville, N.J., a district official said about two dozen teenagers joined the National School Walkout, despite warnings they could be suspended for doing so.
Throngs of students across the metropolitan region vented their frustrations about Americans' easy access to assault weapons.
More than 100,000 of the 1.1 million students in New York City public schools joined the protests, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio's office. Organizers asked students nationwide to walk out of class at 10 a.m. for 17 minutes, one minute for each person killed in the Parkland, Fla., shooting on Feb. 14.


U.S. Sanctions Russia for Interference in Elections
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration slapped Moscow with its first sanctions for meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and waging unrelated cyberattacks on critical U.S. infrastructure, punishing the Kremlin's intelligence agencies and Russians already indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller.
In sanctioning five entities and 19 individuals Thursday, the Treasury and senior national-security officials accused the Russian government of ongoing attacks on the U.S. energy grid, and water, aviation and manufacturing facilities. Senior U.S. national security officials said those attacks gave Moscow access to the control systems that run some U.S. utilities and factories. Russia also targeted U.S. nuclear facilities for cyberattacks.
The U.S. in addition cited a cyberattack last year known as NotPetya that crippled computer networks at multinational firms world-wide. And the administration pointed to the nerve-agent attack earlier this month in the U.K. that left a former Russia spy and his daughter in critical condition.
Congress has expressed growing concern about Russian aggression and the Trump administration's response to it. The concerns, playing out over the past few years, focus on Russia's efforts to influence U.S. elections, cyberattacks on U.S. companies, Moscow's involvement in war-ravaged Ukraine and Syria, and the U.K. nerve-agent attack.
The punitive action Thursday may help address some of those concerns, though analysts said it is unlikely by itself to deter Russia.


Vladimir Taunts the West
Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, propped up Syria's Assad regime, meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, and this month someone in his government approved a chemical-weapons attack on British soil. The Western response so far is the equivalent of a foot stomp and public whining.
Start in Britain, where Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday outlined her response to evidence that Russia-backed agents used the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent to try to assassinate former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury this month. They and a local policeman exposed to the agent are seriously ill, and hundreds of local residents were put at risk.
The attack evoked memories of the 2006 murder with polonium of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London, which was linked to Mr. Putin. Yet the Salisbury attack was a more serious provocation than the Litvinenko hit. Never before had Moscow attacked a spy who was swapped for Russian spies, as Mr. Skripal was, or targeted a spy's family. If Mr. Skripal is fair game, so is any critic of Russia anywhere—which is no doubt the message the Kremlin intended to send.
Yet Russia "treated the use of a military grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance," Mrs. May said Wednesday, as she outlined what she called her "full and robust response." London gave 23 Russian spies a week to leave the country, suspended "all high level bilateral contacts" and confirmed that no member of the British Royal Family would attend the soccer World Cup this summer in Russia. Moving the World Cup out of Moscow would be more like it.
Mrs. May also rallied the U.S., France and Germany to condemn the attack in a joint statement as "the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War," which "threatens the security of us all." The four leaders demanded that Moscow disclose its chemical-weapons activities to a Hague-based organization and "live up to its responsibilities as a member of the U.N. Security Council to uphold international peace and security." The Hague boys shouldn't stay up waiting for an invitation.


With Grip on Power Assured, China's Xi Elevates Lieutenants
BEIJING—Cleared to stay in power indefinitely, Chinese President Xi Jinping has discarded the leadership structure he inherited and is kicking off his second term with a handpicked team of trusted lieutenants.
For the next five years, Mr. Xi will look to his inner circle to shore up a sluggish economy, eradicate poverty and enhance China's global standing—while shielding his ambitious agenda from being derailed by rocky relations with the U.S.
Two men in particular have emerged in key roles: Wang Qishan, the former anticorruption chief who took office as deputy head of state Saturday, and Liu He, the architect of Mr. Xi's economic policies, who was promoted to vice premier Monday.
In recent weeks, Mr. Xi and his two deputies met directly with U.S. officials, people familiar with the matter say—a sign of the president's heightened concerns about China-U.S. ties.
Mr. Xi hosted the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Terry Branstad, at an informal gathering of both men's families in early February, according to people with knowledge of the event. The two have known each other since Mr. Xi visited the U.S. in 1985.


First Lawsuit Filed After Miami Bridge Collapse
A passerby injured in last week's collapse of a pedestrian bridge in Miami has filed a lawsuit against the engineering and construction firms, saying the companies should have realized it was at risk of falling.
Marquise Rashaad Hepburn filed the lawsuit on Monday in Miami-Dade County Civil Court, alleging negligence and defective construction of the bridge at Florida International University, which crumbled Thursday, killing six people and injuring nine more. The bridge's main span, which crossed an eight-lane road, had been put in place days earlier and was expected to open to foot traffic next year.
Mr. Hepburn was riding his bicycle to work and passing underneath the bridge when it collapsed, his lawyer Matt Morgan said. Mr. Hepburn was struck and knocked off his bike by a vehicle as the driver tried to avoid the falling structure, Mr. Morgan said.
Mr. Hepburn hurt his back and is under a doctor's care, though he isn't in a hospital, Mr. Morgan said.
The design and engineering team met hours before the bridge collapse to discuss cracks in the concrete, according to FIU and the state. They said school and state transportation officials also attended the meeting.


Video Shows Las Vegas Gunman Days Before Massacre
In the days leading up to the deadliest shooting massacre in modern U.S. history, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock gambled, and chatted with casino and hotel staff who helped him carry some of the 20-plus pieces of luggage he brought into his room, according to surveillance footage released Thursday.
The suitcases contained an arsenal of 22 semiautomatic rifles, one bolt-action rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition that Paddock used to fire on a crowd of concertgoers from his 32nd-floor hotel suite in the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, according to police. The Oct. 1 massacre left 58 dead.
The selected surveillance clips from the week before the attack, released by MGM Resorts International , which owns the Mandalay Bay, show Paddock on video for the first time.
But they offer no clues to Paddock's motive, which remains a mystery, and little can be detected about his state of mind from the footage. Paddock's dress and demeanor appear relaxed as he is shown at times gambling, eating at a restaurant on the casino floor, and bringing in luggage. Almost everything shown in the footage has been described publicly by investigators.
Debra DeShong, spokeswoman for MGM Resorts, said the footage shows that "Paddock gave no indication of what he planned to do and his interactions with staff and overall behavior were all normal."


Editor's News Picks
Popular election security figure joining DHS: Matthew Masterson, who headed up federal efforts to help states protect their election systems, is moving to the Department of Homeland Security where he will continue working on election security, Reuters reports. The move follows a decision last month by Republican Speaker Paul Ryan to not renew Mr. Masterson's stint with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Reuters reports that some some state election officials and security experts expressed disappointment in the decision, accusing Republicans of not taking election cybersecurity seriously enough. Mr. Masterson's move to the DHS guarantees that he will continue to work on election security heading into the November midterm elections.
The making of a cyber battalion:Wired visits Fort Gordon in Georgia, the traditional home of the US Army Signal Corps and now home to a new cyber branch. "At any given moment at Fort Gordon, instructors in khakis are teaching soldiers at every stage of their career—shiny new privates, steely-eyed noncoms, cherry lieutenants, surly captains," Matthew Gallagher, a former U.S. Army captain, observers. "Meanwhile, elsewhere on the base, about 900 cyber operators who've already passed through a form of this training—70 percent of the Army's 1,300 active-duty cyber soldiers—are doing these very things for real."
Atlanta suffers from ransomware attack: The City of Atlanta is still recovering from a Thursday ransomware attack that encrypted data and caused the shutdown of some services. CBS reported Tuesday that the attack has blocked access to electronic records, with many city employees relying on pen and paper. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms did not say whether the city would pay the ransom. It's not the first time for the city, according to Augusta, Georgia-based Rendition Infosec, which shares with ZDNet information of an attack last year involving tools stolen from the National Security Agency. The April 2017 attacks came more than a month after Microsoft Corp. released patches addressing the exploits, according to company founder Jake Williams. "Based on our data, we can say for an organization of its size, the city of Atlanta had a substandard security posture in April 2017, making the scope of the ransomware attack far from surprising," Mr. Williams tells ZDNet.


Republicans Remain Silent as Mulvaney's CFPB Ducks Oversight
From the moment Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Republican critics ranted about the CFPB's supposed lack of accountability. Now that one of those critics, Mick Mulvaney, has assumed control of the bureau, the attackers have fallen silent—even as Mr. Mulvaney disregards legal mandates and dodges congressional oversight. This turnabout shows Republicans never really cared about accountability. They only wanted the agency to be less effective at stopping financial firms from cheating people.
Congress designed the CFPB to be the government's most accountable bank regulator and created strict guidelines for its mission and operations. Every bank regulator is funded outside the regular appropriations process, but the CFPB has unique additional checks. The bureau is legally required to report to Congress twice a year on its activities, and its director must testify before Congress four times each year. The CFPB's rules can be overruled by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a veto that applies to no other federal agency.
Since Mr. Mulvaney took control, he has ignored congressional mandates, turning the CFPB into the politicized rogue agency he accused it of being before. Example: The law requires the CFPB to create an Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, which "shall have such powers and duties . . . including providing oversight and enforcement of Federal laws" against discrimination in lending. That language is unambiguous, but Mr. Mulvaney, long an opponent of the office's work, summarily stripped it of oversight and enforcement powers. Republicans remained silent.
Mr. Mulvaney also flouted Dodd-Frank's mandate that the CFPB "require reports and conduct examinations" of banks under its jurisdiction. In December he halted collection of confidential information by the bureau, temporarily stopping bank examinations. Mr. Mulvaney claimed that two reports by the bureau's inspector general showed severe vulnerabilities in the bureau's cyber defenses. Instead they found CFPB's cybersecurity was better than other regulators and steadily improving.
When I pressed Mr. Mulvaney on this point in an oversight letter, he did not defend his interpretation of the reports and offered no legitimate explanation for halting bank examinations. Republicans remained silent.


1MDB-Linked Yacht Won't Be Setting Sail Soon
JAKARTA, Indonesia—A potentially prolonged custody battle is unfolding over a $250 million yacht allegedly connected to the 1MDB global scandal, with lawyers moving on multiple fronts to block the U.S. from seizing the boat.
The moves could upend a U.S. win against a Malaysian financier the Justice Department alleges is a central player in a $4.5 billion scandal that has spawned investigations in several nations.
Last month, Indonesian police seized the 300-foot Equanimity, acting on the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had sought the vessel for months. The U.S. has asserted in court filings that U.S. laws were broken in the larger 1MDB case, and that gives it rights to seize assets. The Justice Department had hoped to quickly transport the boat to the U.S. to sell, but a legal challenge to invalidate the seizure has been launched by Indonesian lawyers representing a claimant to the Equanimity in the Indonesian court system.
On Wednesday, a Jakarta court spokesman said hearings in the case would begin April 9, with a decision expected by mid-month. Legal experts said that either party losing the decision would likely take further legal actions.
The Justice Department alleges that 36-year-old Jho Low, the financier, helped siphon off at least $4.5 billion from Malaysian state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. between 2009 and 2015. Since mid-2016, the U.S. has sought, via civil lawsuits in California, to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with the stolen money, including the Equanimity, a Bombardier jet, mansions and royalties from the film "The Wolf of Wall Street."


White House Homeland Security Adviser Bossert Exits
President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser was abruptly forced out of his job Tuesday after months of internal frustration with his leadership and as the new national security adviser moved to establish power in the White House, according to people familiar with the matter.
The departure of Tom Bossert, who has advised Mr. Trump on cybersecurity and counterterrorism since the beginning of his administration, marked the latest exit from the Trump administration as the president reshapes his leadership team.
The surprise move was instigated by John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and ex-Fox News commentator who officially started this week as Mr. Trump's new national security adviser, the people said.
"This is an assertion of the primacy of the national security adviser," said one person familiar with Mr. Bossert's removal.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to discuss Mr. Bolton's role in Mr. Bossert's departure. "He resigned," Ms. Sanders said of Mr. Bossert. "The president feels he's done a great job and wishes him the best as he moves forward."


Cambridge Analytica CEO Post Goes to Julian Wheatland
Cambridge Analytica's acting Chief Executive Alex Tayler told the company's leadership Wednesday that Julian Wheatland, the chairman of Cambridge Analytica's British affiliate, would take over as the company's next chief executive, according to people familiar with the matter.
Alexander Nix, the former CEO who was suspended last month following the release of a video that depicted him touting campaign tactics such as entrapping political opponents with bribes and sex, has officially resigned from his position, according to a person close to the company.
Mr. Tayler, who was appointed acting CEO about three weeks ago, on Wednesday returned to his previous role as the company's chief data officer, the company said in a statement. In that role, he will "focus on the various technical investigations and inquiries," the statement said.
The company didn't announce a new CEO in that statement. When Mr. Tayler told employees Wednesday he was stepping down, he said the company didn't yet have a replacement for him, according to another person familiar with the matter.
A company spokesman said any discussion of Mr. Wheatland's new role was "speculation" and denied that Mr. Nix had submitted his resignation, saying "the independent inquiring is ongoing."


Dispute With Congress Adds to Pressure on Rosenstein
WASHINGTON—A dispute between Congress and the Justice Department about access to law-enforcement documents has further ratcheted up pressure on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is already a target of President Donald Trump's criticism.
The president and his allies have accused Mr. Rosenstein of stonewalling Congress and allowing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to stray beyond its scope. While leaders in both parties have publicly said Mr. Mueller should be allowed to finish his work, some Republicans have increasingly directed their ire at Mr. Rosenstein.
Mr. Rosenstein, who appointed Mr. Mueller and oversees his investigation, is in an increasingly precarious position in Washington—with few allies inside of the administration or on Capitol Hill. This week, one Republican House chairman threatened to try to impeach Mr. Rosenstein over an impasse over congressional access to documents related to the Russia probe—an unusual confrontation between a senior Republican and a high-level official in the administration of his own party.
Justice Department officials have said that requested documents—involving grand-jury secrecy and other information—need to be redacted, making it time-consuming to review. The agency has put dozens of employees on the project to move it along, officials said.
Mr. Trump, who appointed Mr. Rosenstein last year, disparaged the deputy attorney general in a tweet on Wednesday, writing he was conflicted and linking him to the "Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation." Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump directed his Twitter followers to Sean Hannity's Fox News program, where a lawyer close to Mr. Trump urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to dismiss Mr. Rosenstein.


High Stakes in Syria
Donald Trump treasures nothing more than unconstrained access to the world through Twitter . So you know the President is having a bad week when his tweets come back to haunt even him, as they have with Syria. The Syrian tweets were especially damaging—to him personally and his role as Commander in Chief of the U.S. military.
After tweeting that the U.S. is planning missile strikes against Syria and its patron Russia, the twitterverse resurrected his past words mocking Barack Obama for "broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria." Mr. Trump has little use for consistency, but the contradiction is an acute embarrassment.
By Thursday military analysts were saying that Mr. Trump's premature public announcements of missile strikes had compromised the U.S. ability to execute a coordinated, effective response to Syrian strongman Bashar Assad's likely use of chemical weapons against civilians in Douma. Amid this confusion, the President tweeted what for him was a mea culpa: "Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!"
It is never easy to figure where Mr. Trump's omnipresent persona connects with real policy, but Syria is the moment to make the effort. Beyond the Trump tweets lie harsh realities that need to be addressed. It's true that Mr. Obama's inaction dealt the Trump Presidency a tough hand in the Middle East, and that Mr. Trump struck the Assad forces last April with Tomahawk cruise missiles. He also allowed the Pentagon to intensify its effort to erode Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Since then, though, Mr. Trump has shown ambivalence toward the region, saying in Ohio recently that "We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon." His ambivalence has produced unfortunate results. The U.S. has had no identifiable policy toward Syria in a year. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran have moved to consolidate a joint hegemony that would dominate Syria and Iraq and threaten Israel.


The Government Shouldn't Value Bears Over People
King Cove, Alaska
I watched my daughter nearly die in a plane crash—because of a misguided view of how best to protect nesting swans and foraging bears. She was in a single-engine plane with four others in 2010, when it was forced to the ground by a sudden downdraft while approaching our town's little airstrip. Imagine standing by helplessly as your child's plane collides with the runway. Thankfully, the pilot was able to pull the nose up at the last moment, which prevented a catastrophe and saved all on board.
Almost every family here has a similar tale of a close call or tragedy. There are no roads leading to King Cove, a fishing village of about 1,000 people 625 miles southwest of Anchorage, so frequent flying is a must. But the village's short, 3,000-foot gravel runway sits in a wind tunnel between volcanic mountains. Even worse, the airstrip is closed for an average of more than 100 days each year because of poor weather. That's dangerous when someone has a serious medical need—a heart attack or childbirth—and needs to get to Anchorage.
The Cold Bay Airport, 18 miles away, has a 10,000-foot paved runway built to accommodate jet fighters. It is closed fewer than 10 days a year. The trouble is getting from King Cove to Cold Bay.
When weather makes it dangerous to fly by small plane or go by boat, the only lifeline available is the helicopter rescue crews at U.S. Coast Guard Station Kodiak. For years they have been our guardian angels, descending in all conditions, and at great personal risk, to ferry the sick and injured to Cold Bay—at a cost to federal taxpayers of up to $210,000 a mission.


Give Jeff Bezos the Mark Zuckerberg Treatment
Congress was right to call on Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg to explain how a political-consulting firm was able to harvest personal information from 50 million users. But to protect Americans from a far greater data-mining threat, lawmakers must question another tech titan next: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Amazon is amassing consumer data at an alarming rate as it expands from online retail into new ventures like home security, and Americans have entrusted the company with their most sensitive personal information. As major data breaches become increasingly common, Congress should ask Mr. Bezos to explain how his company secures its systems.
Amazon has already shown its vulnerability to hacking. In 2017 Uber revealed that hackers had breached its Amazon Web Services account, gaining access to the names, phone numbers and email addresses of 57 million users.
Uber's information security chief appeared in February before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security to address the company's response to the hack. But Congress neglected to call on Amazon executives to account for their company's role in the incident. It remains unknown what if anything Amazon has done to better protect personal data stored on its web servers.
Amazon's servers suffered a similar data breach earlier this year when hackers targeted the cloud of automaker Tesla in an attempt to mine cryptocurrency. Amazon did not immediately alert Tesla of the hack, presumably because it did not know the hack had occurred. Instead, Tesla learned of the breach from independent researchers at a cybersecurity firm. While no consumer data was exposed, the incident demonstrates how attacks on any of the more than one million businesses using Amazon servers could go undetected for long periods of time.


U.S. Holds Back on New Russia Sanctions
White House officials on Tuesday said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley spoke prematurely in saying the Trump administration would imminently impose new sanctions against Russia over its support for the Assad regime in Syria.
Speaking on CBS on Sunday, Ms. Haley said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce sanctions the following day targeting companies that might have played a role in the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons.
Senior White House officials said her comments surprised them, adding the administration is evaluating additional sanctions but isn't yet ready to roll them out. They said her remarks also rubbed against a longstanding tenet of Treasury's sanctions practices: Avoid telegraphing pending actions to prevent targets from being able to pull their assets out of U.S. reach.
Ms. Haley "got ahead of the curve," the president's top economic adviser, Lawrence Kudlow, said in a press briefing on Tuesday.
While praising her performance as U.N. ambassador, Mr. Kudlow said "there might have been some momentary confusion about that. But if you talk to Steve Mnuchin, he'll tell you the same thing. We have had sanctions. Additional sanctions are under consideration, but not implemented."


Gorsuch's Good Opinion
President Trump said he wanted Supreme Court Justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia, and on Tuesday he got his wish. Though Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the four liberals on an immigration case, his logic would have made the late Justice proud.
In Sessions v. Dimaya, the government sought to deport a legal resident twice convicted of first-degree burglary. The Immigration and Nationality Act lets the government deport any immigrant convicted of a "crime of violence." The question is whether first-degree burglary is a violent crime.
Section 16b of the criminal code includes a residual clause that defines a violent crime as "any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."
Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan invoked the Court's Johnson precedent and held that the residual clause was void for vagueness. In Johnson (2015), Justice Scalia's majority opinion rejected a similar residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act and ruled that its vague language produced "more unpredictability and arbitrariness" than the Constitution allows.
Chief Justice John Roberts's minority opinion tries to distinguish the residual clauses in the two cases to save Section 16b, which he notes "is incorporated into many procedural and substantive provisions of criminal law." But he appears as concerned with the policy results of the Court's decision as the legal merits.


Defining Peace Down in Korea
The South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reports that President Moon Jae-in plans to use his summit with the North's Kim Jong Un next week to reach a preliminary agreement on ending hostilities between the two countries. This report is sourced to a single anonymous official and hasn't been confirmed. Yet the prospect is worth noting because it's consistent with Mr. Moon's recent actions and the stakes are enormous.
Pyongyang's diplomatic playbook calls for a period of provocation to be followed by conciliatory overtures and talks. Having broken every previous agreement, Kim now wants to be excused from sanctions and receive aid for freezing his nuclear and missile programs. The Trump Administration says it won't fall for this trap and insists that the North denuclearize before it receives benefits.
Mr. Moon has done his best to undermine the U.S. "maximum pressure" strategy of sanctions and diplomatic isolation. He invited North Korean officials to attend the Winter Olympics and announced a supposed breakthrough: The North is willing to discuss denuclearization with the U.S. But during those talks the North's friends in Beijing, Moscow and maybe Seoul will pressure the U.S. to relax sanctions. With reduced leverage, the U.S. might be forced to cut another deal that trades aid now in return for promises of denuclearization later.
Mr. Moon is also reportedly offering Kim the carrot of a formal treaty ending the Korean War, which was suspended with an armistice in 1953. Pyongyang has long demanded a treaty because it wants the U.S. to remove its forces from the peninsula, and it interprets denuclearization to mean withdrawal.
Mr. Moon seems to believe that resuming the conciliatory "Sunshine Policy" of his predecessors Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun will reassure the North that it doesn't need nuclear weapons and can gain more benefits by trading them away. But three decades of failed agreements show that the North continues its weapons programs in secret. As the Korea talks unfold, keep your eye not on the word "peace" but on how it is defined in practice.


CIA Memo Says Haspel Isn't to Blame for Destroyed Tapes
WASHINGTON—The Central Intelligence Agency on Friday released a six-year-old internal memo saying Gina Haspel wasn't to blame for the destruction of videotaped interrogations of terror suspects, an effort to shore up support on Capitol Hill for her nomination to lead the spy agency.
The agency declassified and released a 2011 disciplinary review, written by then-Deputy Director Michael Morell, finding that Ms. Haspel, now the deputy director, didn't order the destruction of tapes of interrogations containing evidence of what critics say is torture.
The review instead said the decision to destroy the tapes was made by Ms. Haspel's boss, Jose Rodriguez, who was then the director of the National Clandestine Service. The CIA issued Mr. Rodriguez a letter of reprimand over his behavior, which involved drafting an order to CIA field stations to destroy videotapes of interrogations of two suspects.
"I have found no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel," Mr. Morell's review said, adding: "She drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr. Rodriguez."
At issue were tapes of interrogations of two high-profile detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who were said to have been held at a CIA "black site" in Thailand. During their interrogations, which took place after their captures in 2002, they were waterboarded by the CIA, a technique that simulated drowning and that many critics say amounts to torture.


Armenian Leader Resigns in Wake of Protests
MOSCOW—Armenia's unpopular prime minister stepped down Monday after more than a week of growing demonstrations, capitulating to protesters in a country firmly allied with former Soviet master Moscow.
The resignation of Serzh Sargsyan marks a rare victory for civil protest in a former Soviet Union state and could reduce the possibility of further instability in a tension-plagued area near Russia's southern border. In the wake of the announcement, people in Yerevan, the capital, waved flags and cheered.
Many Armenians had grown tired of a leader they see as arrogant and increasingly authoritarian. Tens of thousands of protesters, including students and members of the military, have taken to the streets since Mr. Sargsyan's party appointed him to become prime minister last week after a decade as president.
Constitutional amendments passed in 2015 in a referendum transferred a majority of power to the head of the government from the president's office.
Protests reached their height in recent days after the detention of opposition leader and lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan following a meeting in which Mr. Sargsyan abruptly walked out of the room during talks. Mr. Pashinyan was released shortly before the prime minister's resignation.


George H.W. Bush Hospitalized for Blood Infection
A day after burying his wife, Barbara, President George H.W. Bush was hospitalized in Houston on Sunday morning with a blood infection, according to a Bush family spokesman.
Mr. Bush, 93, was responding to treatment at Houston Methodist Hospital and "appears to be recovering," family spokesman Jim McGrath said.
Barbara Bushwas laid to rest on Saturday after passing away on April 17 with the 41st president at her side. The family said she had been in failing health and had decided not to seek further medical treatment.
Mr. Bush has also been hospitalized for a variety of serious ailments in recent years. Last year, he was placed in intensive care after suffering from a bout of pneumonia.
In 2015, Mr. Bush was hospitalized in Maine after falling at the family summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. He also was hospitalized a year earlier for shortness of breath.


Ronny Jackson in the Mosh Pit
Operations when death is all but assured are called suicide missions, and it's beginning to look as if Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson was sent on a political version. The nominee to run Veterans Affairs has been under siege from the agency's bureaucracy, anonymous press leaks, and on Tuesday even friendly fire from the President who nominated him.
The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on Tuesday postponed Dr. Jackson's Wednesday confirmation hearing amid allegations of misconduct during his nearly five-year tenure as physician to the President. The charges have been mostly vague and anonymous, such as running a hostile work environment, which could mean anything or nothing.
Late Tuesday afternoon news leaked about a 2012 Inspector General report that found "unprofessional behaviors" from Dr. Jackson and another physician in a power struggle. But if this is accurate, why did President Obama promote him? Senator Jon Tester (D., Mont.) in a press interview said some of Dr. Jackson's colleagues alleged he had been "repeatedly drunk" while on duty, among other claims.
The public has little way to evaluate the merits, and Dr. Jackson deserves at minimum to know who is shooting at him. Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson and Ranking Member Mr. Tester wrote to the White House requesting more information, including communications with Defense Department IGs. There may be more to learn from the documents the White House produces.
The reality is that Dr. Jackson wasn't vetted or adequately prepared for the VA post, and by all accounts wasn't seeking it when President Trump chose him. Dr. Jackson also doesn't appear to have a background in Washington's treacherous politics of veterans.


Syria's War Jolts a Tradition: Gathering Desert Truffles
Seven years into Syria's war, the country's truffle fields have become battlefields.
Even as bombs fell and fighting raged elsewhere in the country, Syria's seasonal hunt for desert truffles weathered the first few years of the conflict largely undisturbed. As they had for generations, Syrian families would spend days foraging in the country's eastern desert for the delicacies to eat or to sell.
But the war shifted eastward last year as both U.S.-backed forces and the Russian-backed Syrian regime fought against Islamic State militants, upending the truffle tradition and putting the prized fungus out of reach for all but Syria's wealthy.
Ibrahim Hussein used to go out to the desert every spring with his family. They would take a tent along and spend their mornings and evenings searching for the meaty truffles—dun-colored and bulbous, but more similar in taste to mushrooms than to the stronger-flavored European variety—and nights grilling them on open fires.
But this season, which ends in May, he couldn't get to the coveted truffles for a second year in a row. He was concerned about possible Islamic State sleeper cells hiding in the desert or IEDs that could be left behind by any one of the combatants in Syria's messy conflict. And there is always the danger that U.S.-coalition drones could mistake truffle foragers for the extremists.


Menendez and the Democrats
Robert Menendez escaped conviction on corruption charges this year thanks in large part to the Supreme Court's 2016 McDonnell standard demanding clear evidence of a specific quid-pro-quo. But that's all the more reason for voters to exercise their own electoral judgment, and now they have new evidence to judge Senatorial sleaze as Mr. Menendez seeks re-election.
Late last week the Senate Ethics Committee—three Democrats and three Republicans—released a four-page letter that "severely admonished" Mr. Menendez for abusing his office and bringing "discredit" to the Senate.
The letter says that for six years Mr. Menendez "knowingly and repeatedly accepted gifts of significant value" from his close friend Salomon Melgen, a Palm Beach doctor and Democratic Party donor. These gifts included private and commercial plane flights, a luxury Paris hotel stay, and lodging on 19 occasions at a Dominican Republic villa.
Mr. Menendez also failed to gain "required Committee approval" for the gifts and "failed to publicly disclose" them "as required by Senate Rule and federal law."
At the same time, Mr. Menendez intervened with federal officials "to advance Dr. Melgen's personal and business interests." This included lobbying for Melgen right up to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute. Mr. Menendez is fortunate that then HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius rejected his lobbying because the lack of a specific government act may have saved him in his criminal case.


Europe and the Euroskeptics
The European Commission on Wednesday formally unveiled its spending wish list for the European Union, and hang onto your hat. The year-long fiscal wrangling to come will be instructive about what European leaders have learned, or think they've learned, about what euroskeptic voters want.
The EU's bureaucratic arm is requesting a budget of €1.3 trillion ($1.6 trillion) over seven years. Nations make financial commitments to the bloc's administration in seven-year chunks, and the next so-called Multiannual Financial Framework will run from 2021 to 2027. After the bureaucrats and national leaders hash out a deal, the European Parliament will have to approve it.
The budget proposal's size is sure to make euroskeptics twitch. The Commission wants to spend 1.11% of Europe's cumulative gross national income ( GNI ) over the life of the plan, compared with the traditional cap of 1%. The U.K. will have left the bloc by the time this budget takes effect, meaning Brussels will spend a larger share of a smaller EU economy. Aware of the political danger, and to make up for the loss of Britain's €13 billion annual contribution, Brussels is offering spending reductions alongside requests for more cash.
Farm subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which accounts for 40% of the current budget, would fall by about 5%. Useful reforms in the creaking CAP include giving national governments more responsibility for projects and how to allocate CAP money, and cutting subsidies for larger farms.
Public-works spending under the cohesion programs that currently eat another 35% of the budget would shrink by 7%. The most controversial proposal here is an attempt to link some payments to the rule of law in the recipient countries—a clear poke at Poland and Hungary, which are feuding with Brussels over independent courts and free civil society.


Mueller and the Judge
A judge who's been serving on the federal bench since the 1980s is old enough to remember when Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was about alleged Russian collusion. Now the judge wants to know why Mr. Mueller's signature prosecution doesn't appear to have anything to do with it.
Mr. Mueller's team was in court today trying to advance its tax and bank fraud charges against Paul Manafort, who briefly ran the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.
Reuters reports:
"I don't see what relationship this indictment has with anything the special counsel is authorized to investigate," U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in the Eastern District of Virginia said.
At a tense hearing at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, the judge said Mueller should not have "unfettered power" in his Russia probe and that the charges against Manafort did not arise from the investigation into Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
Bloomberg adds:
Manafort attorney Kevin Downing argued that Mueller overstepped his May 2017 appointment order, which directed him to pursue links between Russia and the Trump campaign, as well as "any matter that arose or may arise directly" from the investigation. He said that Mueller improperly took over existing Justice Department investigations into Manafort without adequately explaining what connection it had to the Russia probe.
The judge is not just searching for an explanation as to how the Manafort prosecution relates to Russia and the 2016 election. He also wants to know just how far the special counsel's authority extends. Team Mueller doesn't want to tell him.


Blankenship Draws Swipe From Trump Before West Virginia Vote
President Donald Trump inserted himself into Tuesday's Republican Senate primary in West Virginia, urging voters to reject a scandal-scarred former coal executive whose apparent polling strength is stirring fears that he could cost the party a chance to pick up a seat from Democrats.
In a tweet Monday, Mr. Trump said the former executive, Don Blankenship, "can't win the General Election in your State..No Way! Remember Alabama." He then urged voters to choose one of two other Republicans in the race, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins or the state's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey.
The winner of Tuesday's GOP primary will run in November against Sen. Joe Manchin, who is considered one of 2018's most vulnerable Democrats.
Mr. Trump's comments suggested a last-ditch effort to salvage a primary race that Republicans in Washington thought had swung to either Mr. Jenkins or Mr. Morrisey. Last week, the two spent most of a prime-time Fox News debate attacking each other instead of seeking to undercut Mr. Blankenship, who served a year in prison on a charge of conspiring to violate mine-safety laws after 29 people died in a 2010 explosion at a coal mine operated by his Massey Energy Co. Mr. Blankenship, for his part, used the debate to cast himself as an antiestablishment outsider.
As the weekend rolled around, many Republicans started to worry that polls that had once showed Mr. Blankenship in third place had begun to shift in the former coal executive's direction.


A Pakistani Family's Nightmare: Daughter Studying Abroad Killed at Texas School
The foreign students were wrapping up a retreat in a North Carolina town, sharing stories about their first six months in the U.S., when Sabika Sheikh captivated the room with a spur-of-the moment speech: she prayed every night to wake up to a world of peace, her friend at the retreat recalled her saying.
Ms. Sheikh, a 17-year-old from Pakistan, faced the opposite of peace last Friday, just a few weeks shy of the end of her year abroad in Texas when a Santa Fe High School student attacked the school. She was one of eight students killed, along with two teachers.
"That girl came to America to experience a new culture, to see how the school system works here," said Zerina Spahalic, a Bosnian studying in Kentucky through the same program as Ms. Sheikh. "And she was killed in a place where nobody would think she would be killed."
People think of Pakistan as a place of violence and instability, said Ms. Spahalic, 16, also from a country born of years of war. "But that girl died in America. That's hard for me."
Abdul Aziz Sheikh, Ms. Sheikh's father, said the family was "shocked and senseless" when they learned she died.


Texas School Shooting Victims Remembered at Church Service
SANTA FE, Texas—Members of Arcadia First Baptist Church in Santa Fe, just down the road from the site of Friday's deadly high-school shooting, shook hands and received hugs and words of comfort from Gov. Greg Abbott before the start of Sunday services.
"I'm here to comfort my fellow Texans," Mr. Abbott said.
The service focused on healing from Friday's shooting that killed 10 and injured 13 more at Santa Fe High School. Speakers recognized the victims, the first responders, and even the family of Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17-year-old charged in the shooting.
Ted Elmore, with the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention, told the crowd that returning to normalcy would be difficult.
"One of the things you can expect is the hurt goes deep and it stays around a long time," he said, noting that it is a lesson he says he learned while ministering to people in Sutherland Springs, where a gunman opened fire in a church last year killing 26.


Remember the Pueblo, Mr. President
North Korea released three U.S. hostages in the run-up to next month's summit with President Trump. It should follow up by returning the USS Pueblo.
Sent to map North Korean radar stations in January 1968, the spy ship, whose top speed was 13 knots, was pursued by North Korean gunboats. Machine-gun fire and artillery shells raked the ship, wounding 10 sailors, one fatally. The former freighter was armed only with two machine guns, tied down under ice-covered tarps. Uncovering and loading the jam-prone guns, Cmdr. Lloyd "Pete" Bucher later said, would have heightened the risk to his crew.
As the Pueblo desperately sought to evade capture, crewmen burned punch cards to keep secrets from the enemy, and smoke poured out of the vessel. Six fast gunboats swarmed in. A pair of MiG fighters circled overhead. Surrounded and outgunned, Bucher surrendered without firing a shot.
That saved the lives of all but one of 83 Americans aboard, including two civilian oceanographers. But Bucher's decision was controversial. It was the first surrender of a U.S. Navy ship since 1807. Although many cards were burned, the loss of classified material "would dwarf anything in previous U.S. cryptologic history," a 1992 National Security Agency report, classified until 2012, found. Some admirals publicly demanded a court-martial.
Seeing his crew beaten, starved and tortured over 11 months in captivity, Bucher repeatedly rallied them to persevere. When his captors sought propaganda photos, he led the men in raising their middle fingers—claiming it was the "Hawaiian good-luck sign." Bucher's last written confession is a masterpiece of double-talk, translating harmlessly into Korean while clear enough to any American:


North Korea, While Professing Peace, Escalated Cyberattacks Against South
SEOUL—When the North and South Korean leaders vowed on April 27 to cease all hostile acts against each other, many saw it as a turning point in cross-border relations and a step toward a new era of peace.
In the weeks since their agreement, the North ramped up its campaign of cyberattacks on South Korea, launching fresh assaults on financial companies and groups focused on North Korea, according to people familiar with the matter. The frequency of those attacks also increased this month, one of the people said.
The latest wave of hacking shows how the Kim regime extended a longstanding pattern of aggressive behavior toward Seoul despite publicly pledging warmer relations as it prepared for a summit with President Donald Trump. The U.S. called off the summit Thursday in response to new threats from Pyongyang.
The South Korean government is reviewing the cyberattacks, which started in the lead-up to the inter-Korean summit in April and continued through at least Wednesday, the people said. Early indications, based on the malware and targets, strongly suggest North Korea was the culprit, the people said.
The groups targeted include South Korean financial companies and organizations that focus on North Korea, the people said, with hackers seeking sensitive information. As with nearly all cyberbreaches, it is unclear how many computers were infected or what precisely was stolen.


Are Huawei and ZTE a Real Cybersecurity Threat?
The U.S. government's remarkable campaign against Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. , which has involved a series of actions aimed at limiting the Chinese manufacturers' business in the U.S. and elsewhere, is rooted in a cybersecurity fear.
Huawei and ZTE are the world's No. 1 and No. 4 makers of telecommunications equipment, such as the cellular-tower electronics that wireless carriers need. Washington worries that the Chinese government could order the companies to tap the products they make to spy, disable communications or launch other cyberattacks. Among other steps, the Trump administration has banned U.S. suppliers from selling components to ZTE, a move that could shut down the company, though U.S. and Chinese officials are negotiating a reprieve for ZTE.
Huawei and ZTE say the concerns about them are unfounded. But is the threat real?
Telecommunications cybersecurity experts say yes—with caveats. A manufacturer could easily disable telecom equipment that it made, but using the equipment to spy would be difficult. And any incursion would be quickly detected and would work only once.
How systems work
To better understand the risks, and their limitations, first consider how mobile-phone calls work. Suppose someone in Seattle uses a cellphone to call someone in Miami. After the caller dials, the phone connects to a nearby cellular tower. That tower is connected to wires, which are connected to a giant network of wires across America that zap the call to a cellular tower near the person in Miami. Then the tower will beam the call to that person's phone.


Three Killed in Suspected Terror Attack in Belgium
BRUSSELS—Belgian authorities are investigating a potential terrorist attack after a man Tuesday killed three people and took a woman hostage before being shot dead by police in the eastern Belgian town of Liege.
"The case is being investigated as a terrorist crime," said Liege prosecutor Philippe Dulieu during a news conference. He didn't give details on why the case was classified as terrorism.
Witnesses interviewed by local television news said they heard the attacker shout "Allahu akbar," an Arabic phrase meaning "God is great."
According to Mr. Dulieu, the assailant approached two female police officers from behind and stabbed them before taking their weapons and shooting them dead.
The man then shot and killed a 22-year-old man in a car parked nearby, according to the prosecutor. The attacker entered a nearby school and took a woman hostage before trying to escape. He wounded several police officers before he was killed, Mr. Dulieu said.


The Year Politics Collapsed
The modern era of American politics—defined by polarization and nonstop intensity—began with the cataclysmic events of 1968, now celebrating, if that's the right word, its 50th anniversary.
Everyone says the pace of events in the Trump presidency is overwhelming. Compared with 1968, the past year has been a walk in the park.
Nineteen sixty-eight was one of the greatest anni horribiles ever to happen inside the U.S., producing war, assassinations and riots.
During the 2008 Democratic primaries, Sen. Barack Obama, who turned 7 in 1968, took a generational shot at Sen. Hillary Clinton, who turned 21 at Wellesley: "Senator Clinton and others, they have been fighting some of the same fights since the '60s."
Well yes, it's the fight that will never end.


New York Judge Declares a Mistrial in Ex-County Executive's Bribery Case
A Long Island judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of Edward Mangano, the former Nassau County executive accused of public-corruption crimes, after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.
Federal prosecutors said they would retry the case, which had offered a window into what they had called the county's pay-to-play culture.
"I want to thank so many people, certainly the jury, that really did put in time and effort here," Mr. Mangano, a Republican, told reporters outside the courthouse. The trial, he said, was a hurtful, devastating time for him and his family.
"I'm going to look at this as the glass is half full, rather than half empty," said Mr. Mangano's wife, Linda, who was a co-defendant, of the possibility of a retrial.
John Carman, an attorney for Ms. Mangano, said the jury was split 11-1 in favor of acquittal for his client. "Linda Mangano deserved an acquittal and the excused jurors indicated she just missed getting one," he said.


Stormy Daniels Sues Ex-Lawyer, Saying He Colluded With Cohen
Former adult-movie star Stephanie Clifford sued her former lawyer on Wednesday, alleging he served the interests of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, instead of his client's when her $130,000 hush-money agreement became public earlier this year.
The lawsuit alleged the lawyer, Keith Davidson, breached his fiduciary duty to Ms. Clifford, whose professional name is Stormy Daniels, by maintaining a cozy relationship with Mr. Cohen, "the purpose of which was not to benefit Ms. Clifford, but to benefit Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump."
Mr. Davidson's lawyers, Gene Rossi and Michael Padula of the law firm Carlton Fields, denied the allegations and said the lawsuit cast suspicion on what was a normal professional relationship between two lawyers on opposite sides of a negotiated deal.
Mr. Rossi said the suit also was an effort by Ms. Clifford's current lawyer, Michael Avenatti, to distract from recent reports on his conduct in disputes with creditors and former law partners and other lawyers.
"This lawsuit is a shiny object that is part of his publicity tour to divert attention from the allegations made against him over the last several weeks," Mr. Rossi said.


Their Grandparents Toppled a Dictator. Now They Are the Revolutionaries
MANAGUA, Nicaragua—The children and grandchildren of Nicaraguan revolutionaries who fought alongside Daniel Ortega to topple a dictatorship four decades ago are now leading a movement to oust him from power.
The nation's largest public university, once a stronghold of Mr. Ortega's leftist Sandinista revolution, has become a command bunker for a student-led revolt. The government is loath to dislodge the several hundred student rebels holed up at National Autonomous University, where dozens of barricades made of paving-stone and sheet iron control access.
More violence could further inflame a conflict during which police and paramilitary groups have killed at least 120 people in the past seven weeks. A student leader said that includes four people at the university.
"Ortega is a murderer and he has to go now," said a 21-year old engineering student wearing olive-green fatigues who calls herself Comandante Tortuga (Commander Turtle), a moniker in the Sandinista tradition. "The awakening of the Nicaraguan people has no turning back."
This granddaughter of a revolutionary fighter commanded a hilltop campsite surrounded by sandbag trenches overlooking the now-closed campus. A friend who calls himself RoboCop wields a small homemade mortar.


We All See the Iceberg but Nobody Is Steering
Ohio Gov. John Kasich warns that "Entitlements Will Eat America's Economy" (op-ed, May 31) and urges today's Congress to pass a spending bill that balances the budget. How, exactly, does he propose ending the current political game of fiscal chicken? Democrats can win big if they stick to the narrative that today's entitlements are affordable as long as Republicans stop giving tax cuts to their rich friends. If there is a blue wave on the horizon and if Democrats also capture the White House in 2020, talk in Washington will shift to expanded entitlements after tax cuts are rescinded. For a decade or more, Democrats have held military spending hostage to social spending. Republicans who broached the topic of Social Security or Medicare reform were portrayed as heartless, right-wing fanatics.
If Mr. Kasich is serious, let him propose specific benefit reforms and cost reductions that he thinks American voters will welcome and approve and that Democrats and their media friends won't demagogue to death.

Trump's 'War Game' Stoppage Sows Confusion
The White House said Tuesday that the U.S. military would continue to train with its South Korean counterparts and conduct military drills—but not large-scale, joint exercises—in a clarification of an offer by President Donald Trump to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
The clarification, coming while Mr. Trump was still flying back from his summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore, was issued by a White House official after Vice President Mike Pence spent much of the day meeting with lawmakers who sought to understand what the president had promised.
Mr. Trump said at a Tuesday news conference in Singapore that for the duration of talks, he was stopping U.S. "war games," which he said were "tremendously expensive" and provocative to North Korea. The offer wasn't part of the joint statement between Messrs. Trump and Kim, and was criticized by some lawmakers for giving away too much. North Korean media early Wednesday played up Mr. Trump's cancellation of the maneuvers.
Mr. Pence met in closed session with GOP lawmakers, and some later said he told them that "regular readiness training and training exchanges" would continue, according to a Twitter message by Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.).
Across Washington at the Pentagon, defense officials scrambled to understand what Mr. Trump's offer meant for officers and troops who have to implement the decision. The Pentagon was unable to provide details about the future of the longstanding military relationship between the U.S. and South Korea, which jointly guard one of the most heavily protected borders in the world.


Inside Former Texas Walmart, a Shelter for Migrant Boys
BROWNSVILLE, Texas—Inside a converted Walmart Supercenter about 6 miles from the U.S. border with Mexico, nearly 1,500 young immigrant boys have found their first home in the U.S.
The shelter for immigrant youth in the corner of South Texas opened last year with a capacity of about 1,200. It expanded last month and had fewer than 50 beds to spare on Wednesday afternoon.
For several weeks, the Trump administration has been pursuing the controversial policy of separating parents and children caught crossing into the U.S. illegally, part of its broader effort to reduce the flow of foreigners coming into the U.S. It has been sending the children to temporary foster homes or shelters like this one.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has begun prosecuting nearly every adult caught crossing the border illegally. He has warned parents that if they don't want to be separated from their children, they shouldn't come here illegally.
"You're going to see a lot of kids," Juan Sanchez, president and chief executive of Southwest Key Programs, which runs the Casa Padre shelter, told a group of reporters touring the facility Wednesday. "This has been a time of getting a lot of kids really fast."


Trump's Comments on Immigration Muddy Prospects for Compromise Bill
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump on Friday upended delicate House negotiations over immigration legislation by suggesting he wouldn't sign a compromise measure, prompting a clarifying tweet from the president and leaving Republicans uncertain about how to proceed.
In a morning interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump had indicated he wouldn't sign a "moderate" immigration bill, a remark that was taken by many to mean he was rejecting a recently released bill assembled by negotiators from the GOP's moderate and conservative wings. The bill is aimed at giving young immigrants legal status while also tightening the border and moving to a merit-based immigration system.
By Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump had tweeted comments that appeared to suggest he continued to support both a compromise bill and an alternative favored by conservatives. "Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration," Mr. Trump wrote, referring to some provisions included in the compromise measure. "Go for it! WIN!"
Later Friday, a White House spokesman issued a statement reiterating the president's stance, saying that in the morning he had been talking about an earlier effort promoted by centrist Republicans, and committing him to signing either bill.
"The president fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill," Raj Shah said. "He would sign either the Goodlatte or the leadership bills."


Manafort Ordered to Jail Until Trial
Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, was ordered to jail Friday while he awaits trial by a judge who said he couldn't be trusted to follow the rules of the judicial system.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's office last week charged Mr. Manafort and a business associate, a 48-year-old Russian named Konstantin Kilimnik, with trying to influence the testimony of potential witnesses against the former campaign chief.
Mr. Mueller's office also asked the court to revoke Mr. Manafort's $10 million bail package, which largely confined him, since his October 2017 arrest, to his Virginia home until his September trial. On Friday, the judge agreed.
"I cannot turn a blind eye to this allegation," U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson told a packed Washington, D.C., courtroom that spilled into a crowded overflow room.
Mr. Manafort faces two cases, in Washington and Virginia, that allege he didn't properly report his work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine that included lobbying efforts on their behalf in the U.S., or pay taxes on related income. Judge Jackson is overseeing the Washington case, which focuses on the lobbying allegations and is scheduled to begin in September. The Virginia trial starts earlier, in July.


The Force Behind Europe's Populist Tide: Frustrated Youth
A youth revolt is upending Italian politics, and it could be a harbinger of things to come.
Western Europe's largest antiestablishment government came to power earlier this month, driven largely by young Italian voters. Struggling with a persistent lack of job prospects over the past decade, they voted in droves for two parties in the country's March 4 elections, the 5 Star Movement and the League, an anti-immigration party.
The result laid bare a stark generation gap, with older Italians, who often have to support their grown children, continuing to vote for mainstream parties.
The same pattern appears across southern Europe, and the forces behind the divide show few signs of slowing. Almost 30% of Italians age 20 to 34 aren't working, studying or in a training program, according to Eurostat, more than in any other European Union country. Greece is second at 29%, while Spain's rate is 21%.
"Italy is collapsing and yet nothing has changed in this country for at least 30 years," said Carlo Gaetani, a self-employed engineer in Puglia. Ten years ago, when he was in his early 20s, he voted for a center-left party that he hoped would push for economic development in southern Italy. When Italy descended into a crippling recession, he felt betrayed by the traditional Italian left-wing parties. He has seen friends struggle to find jobs, and said his own business opportunities are limited to the stagnant private sector, because commissions for the public sector are usually awarded to people with connections he doesn't have.


The New Jersey Tax Spiral Continues
New Jersey's Democrats are in a budget standoff between worse and worser, though it's difficult to tell which proposal is which.
Governor Phil Murphy, who defeated the ghost of Chris Christie in last November's election, is pushing for a new "millionaires tax," which would bump the top rate on personal income to 10.75% from 8.97%. He also wants to add nearly half a percentage point to the sales tax, raising it to 7%. New Jersey already has the country's highest property taxes.
Senate President Stephen Sweeney voted for a "millionaires tax" several times when he knew Mr. Christie would veto it. But now that state and local taxes can no longer be deducted on a federal return, Mr. Sweeney worries Mr. Murphy's plan would send even more high-earning residents packing for Florida.
Instead he wants to temporarily—yeah, right—raise the state's top corporate tax rate from 9% to 13%, which would be the highest in the nation. So that way New Jerseyans will stay put, and only their employers will flee?
Neither side is budging despite the Governor's veto threat. As the Senate was gearing up to pass its proposal Thursday, Mr. Murphy went on a tear: "I got elected to come here and crack the back of this idiocy of kicking the can, phantom numbers, band-aids, toothpicks." Mr. Sweeney's reply: "We are the Legislature. And we're not gonna be dictated."


Trump to Host Italian Leader Conte at the White House After NATO Summit
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump next month will host Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, leader of the country's coalition government of two antiestablishment parties, at the White House.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement said the two leaders would look to "deepen cooperation in addressing global conflicts and promoting economic prosperity." She called Italy "an important NATO ally, a leading partner in Afghanistan and Iraq, and key in bringing stability to the Mediterranean region."
Italy's government has set an agenda of revisiting the European Union's budget rules, curbing immigration and lifting sanctions against Russia.
Mr. Conte was one of the few leaders this month to back Mr. Trump's suggestion to have Russia rejoin the Group of Seven industrialized nations, a declaration that rattled other members of the group.
After Mr. Trump made the suggestion—saying, "We have a world to run..We should have Russia at the negotiating table"—Mr. Conte wrote on Twitter : "I agree with President Trump: Russia should re-enter the G-8. It's in everyone's interests."


Capital Gazette Staff Warned Years Ago to Call 911 If They Saw Shooting Suspect
LAUREL, Md.—Capital Gazette staff were shown a photo of Jarrod W. Ramos years ago, and warned that if they ever saw him to call 911, a former editor and publisher said.
Police say they investigated in 2013 after Mr. Ramos allegedly made concerning comments online regarding the newspaper company. On Thursday, authorities say, he barricaded one door at the Annapolis, Md., newsroom, shot his way through another and killed five employees with a 12-gauge shotgun.
The revelations about Mr. Ramos's behavior and the worries he aroused emerged as authorities charged the 38-year-old with five counts of first-degree murder following the attack.
He was held without bail after a brief court hearing Friday. The local public defender's office, which is representing Mr. Ramos, declined to comment.
"Some people have said the threats were veiled, but it was pretty clear to us working there at the time," said Thomas Marquardt, who stepped down as the paper's editor and publisher in 2012. "They weren't vague to me at all. I felt threatened the whole time."


A Left Turn in Mexico
Mexico entered a brave old world on Sunday by electing former Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador to a six-year term as president. The 64-year-old left-wing populist has lost twice, in 2006 and 2012, but this time he won against two weak candidates while promising more moderate policies.
The official vote count wasn't available late Sunday evening, but exit polls gave Mr. López Obrador a large enough margin to call him the winner. Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) is expected to finish a distant second with Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate José Antonio Meade in third. Early indications suggest the president-elect's coattails will make his Morena front, which includes smaller parties, the largest coalition in both legislative chambers.
The campaign was marred by violence at the local level. But kudos to Mexico's National Electoral Institute, which handled 157,000 polling stations and some nine million more registered voters than in 2012. The largely peaceful vote is another milestone in Mexico's progress as a democracy since the days when Mr. López Obrador worked for the PRI that ran the country as a one-party state.
AMLO, as Mr. López Obrador is known, is a career politician from the oil-rich southern state of Tabasco. But in this race he ran as an outsider, pledging to end corruption, upend the establishment in politics and economics—which he called "mafias of power"—and use subsidies to lift the poor, especially in rural areas. He said he would make Mexicans better off by assigning the state a larger role in the economy.
AMLO has moderated his rhetoric from the decades when he railed against private investment in energy and other economic competition as Mexico shifted toward free markets. But his Morena party, which he founded in 2014, is home to many who are nostalgic for the not-so-glorious days of PRI dominance. They have never accepted the country's transition to an open economy with more political and institutional transparency.


NATO Allies Hope for Harmony, Fear Trump Ahead of Summit
U.S. and allied officials are working hard to choreograph a NATO meeting next week that would be a tableau of unity, and show that the 29-member alliance is fighting terrorism, standing up to Russia and working closely to boost military spending.
But President Donald Trump has already disrupted the mood, and raised the stakes, by warning European leaders in a series of blunt letters that they are not doing their share.
"I understand domestic political pressures," Mr. Trump wrote in a letter on June 19 to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "It will, however, become increasingly difficult to justify to American citizens why some countries continue to fail to meet our shared collective security commitments."
In Europe, some leaders have bristled at Mr. Trump's pressure campaign, inserting a potential point of friction in the continuing summit preparations.
"I am not very impressed by this type of letter," said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, whose government has one of the lowest levels of military spending in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in terms of GDP but which has promised to step up defense expenditures in the future.


Trump Zeroes In on Supreme Court Pick
WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump headed into the weekend still undecided about whom he will pick for the Supreme Court, but people familiar with the process said they believe he is moving toward selecting Judge Brett Kavanaugh ahead of a Monday announcement.
Mr. Trump was to discuss the pick Friday night at dinner with Vice President Mike Pence, who personally met this week with Judges Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Raymond Kethledge. Mr. Pence hasn't met with any of the other candidates, according to a White House official.
Messrs. Trump and Pence also were expected to talk by phone over the weekend, after Mr. Trump's key advisers spent time this week reviewing questionnaires submitted by candidates on their positions.
Mr. Trump has pledged to reveal his choice Monday night, and in the final days of his search has gone back and forth over the different candidates, weighing their merits.
After a phone interview with Judge Thomas Hardiman on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called him again on Thursday, an indication that the judge, who sits on the Philadelphia-based Third Circuit Court of Appeals, was still in the running, people familiar with the matter said.


Tariffs Made America Great
Most people probably don't realize that tariffs set America on the path to become a world power. The British colonies in America grew rapidly as an economic force in the early 17th century, selling rice, wheat, corn and cod to the British West Indies, where the goods fed a huge slave population. By the early 1700s, the American colonies traded more with the Caribbean—including both French and British colonies—than with England. The British became concerned about their version of a trade deficit.
So how did the British government respond? It imposed a tariff—the Molasses Act of 1733—that levied heavy duties on molasses imported into the colonies from any non-British colony or country. Since molasses was a staple of the American diet, the British figured Americans would grumble but end up buying molasses produced in the British Caribbean rather than pay the tariff. No such luck—the Americans simply avoided the tariff by smuggling molasses from the French Caribbean.
The next attempt was in 1764, when Parliament beefed up customs enforcement and added a number of products to the tariff list, including Madeira wine. The idea was to persuade Americans to start drinking Port, which the British exported through a commercial treaty with Portugal. This also failed, not only because the colonists simply smuggled more molasses, but they boycotted both Madeira and Port, since they mostly drank rum anyway.
What followed were the infamous Stamp and Townsend acts, which directly taxed the colonists and imposed import duties on various items, including tea. The reaction to those tariffs was the Boston Tea Party, along with numerous other citizen actions to oppose British tariffs. Finally, the British blockaded Boston Harbor in 1774 in an attempt to starve the rebellious Americans. That was a foolish move since the colonies, which had become leading exporters of agricultural and fish products, had more than enough food.
The misguided "Britain First" policy of imposing punitive tariffs as a way to address a trade deficit led to rebellion and the independence of the American colonies. Yet one more example of how trade wars can lead to serious unintended consequences, hurting those who started them, and benefiting those meant to be punished.


International Treaty Bans Military Use of Outer Space
In his otherwise excellent summary of our nation's potential military approaches to space ("Space Force! Space Force!," op-ed, June 25), Taylor Dinerman, although noting that international law provides for peaceful uses of that realm, fails to mention that international law (via Article IV of the 1967 outer space treaty) additionally forbids the use of the moon and other celestial bodies for any military uses whatsoever.

Election-Year Devices
Democrats want the November election to be all about Donald J. Trump, and Donald J. Trump seems to agree. Thus the President's attempt to dominate every news cycle with tweets and political rallies. But far more will be at stake in the battle to control Congress, as a House vote Tuesday showed.
The House voted to repeal the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that was part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Because the tax hits sales, companies have to pay it even if they aren't profitable—which makes it especially damaging for new firms short on cash.
"This bill reverses a harmful tax that is hurting job growth and innovation across the country," said chief sponsor Erik Paulsen, a Republican from Minnesota, which is home to Medtronic and other device companies.
Congress has suspended the tax twice but the moratorium expires in January 2020. The House vote was bipartisan and overwhelming, with all but one Republican and 57 Democrats in favor, and 131 Democrats against. Those Democratic nays include nearly all of the House Democratic leaders, who will control the agenda if they retake the House, as they are now favored to do. Mr. Paulsen is a leading Democratic target.
Senate Democrats are expected to block the bill before the election, though many of them have voted for it in the past. They want to block any GOP legislative victory—another reminder of the policy stakes in November.


Judge Clears Path for Lawsuits Challenging Census Citizenship Question
A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said lawsuits seeking to block the Trump administration from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census could move forward, clearing the way for a legal battle over a question that hasn't been asked on the 10-year survey in decades.
In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said questions about the census fall within the purview of the courts, rejecting the Trump administration's argument that courts lack jurisdiction on the issue.
"Courts have a critical role to play in reviewing the conduct of the political branches to ensure that the census is conducted in a manner consistent with the Constitution and applicable law," Judge Furman wrote.
Judge Furman added that deference was owed to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Jr., who has said reinstating the question would help enforce the Voting Rights Act.
In March, the Trump administration said it would ask respondents to the 2020 Census whether they are U.S. citizens. The announcement prompted outcry from some states and advocacy groups, who say asking about citizenship would decrease responses in states with large immigrant populations and make the census less accurate.


New Orleans Shooting Leaves Three Dead, Seven Wounded
NEW ORLEANS—Two armed individuals walked up to a crowd gathered Saturday evening outside a strip mall in New Orleans and opened fire, killing three people and wounding seven more, the police chief said.
The shooting happened on a busy thoroughfare about 3 miles from the French Quarter, police said.
Police chief Michael Harrison, speaking to reporters late Saturday in televised comments, said the two suspects believed to be wearing hoodies had a rifle and a handgun. He said they appeared to have fired indiscriminately into the crowd, striking 10 people. Before fleeing, they took time to stand over one person.
"We believe that they actually stood over one of the individuals and fired multiple rounds and then after that fled," he said.
Police responding to the shooting found three victims—two men and one woman—who were pronounced dead at the scene. Seven other victims—five men and two women—were taken to two separate hospitals. Four of them were driven in private vehicles, and three were transported by ambulance.


Pence Blames Russia for 2016 Election Interference
Vice President Mike Pence put the blame for 2016 election interference squarely on Russia and pledged that the Trump administration would step up efforts to deter cyberattacks against U.S. democracy.
"While other nations possessed the capability, Russia meddled in our 2016 election," Mr. Pence said Tuesday in his first significant speech about cybersecurity. "That is the unambiguous judgment of our intelligence community, and as the president said, we 'accept the intelligence community's conclusion.' "
Mr. Pence's remarks, delivered at a government-hosted cybersecurity summit in New York, amounted to the White House's strongest condemnation of Russia's election interference to date. Their directness stood in contrast to mixed messages from President Donald Trump in recent weeks, in which he has at times played down the role of Moscow in election interference and suggested others could be to blame, while also saying he accepted the finding of Russia's culpability.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, as well as possible obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing by his campaign and called the probe a "witch hunt." Moscow has denied any interference.
The summit was an attempt by the Trump administration to project a united front on prioritizing cybersecurity as a top national security concern, amid criticism from lawmakers in both parties that it hasn't developed a coherent cybersecurity strategy, particularly on safeguarding the 2018 midterms from hacking or other forms of Russian interference.


Trump Presses Sessions to End Russia Probe
WASHINGTON—President Trump urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation "right now," as negotiations continued between his lawyers and special counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a possible interview.
The comments renewed public pressure on the nation's top law-enforcement official to halt a probe that has resulted in charges against his former campaign officials and more than two dozen Russians.
"This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further," Mr. Trump wrote Wednesday in a series of Twitter posts about Mr. Mueller's investigation.
The president's comments came a day after the opening of a closely watched criminal trial involving Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, who is fighting bank-fraud and tax-evasion charges. It is the first trial by prosecutors for Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates, as well as potential obstruction of justice.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing by himself or his campaign. Moscow has denied any election interference. The charges against Mr. Manafort cite activities that predate the Trump campaign and aren't related to Russia's electoral activities.


Notable & Quotable: A Liberal for Kavanaugh
Lisa Blatt writing at Politico.com, Aug. 2:
Sometimes a superstar is just a superstar. That is the case with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who had long been considered the most qualified nominee for the Supreme Court if Republicans secured the White House. The Senate should confirm him.
I have argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court, more than any other woman. I worked in the Solicitor General's Office for 13 years during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations. Because I am a liberal Democrat and feminist, I expect my friends on the left will criticize me for speaking up for Kavanaugh. But we all benefit from having smart, qualified and engaged judges on our highest court, regardless of the administration that nominates them.
What happened to Merrick Garland was a disgrace. His nomination was the Democratic equivalent of Kavanaugh's. Garland, too, is brilliant, admired, experienced, sober and humane. Indeed, Kavanaugh himself called Garland "supremely qualified" for the Supreme Court. . . .
But unless the Democrats want to stand on the principle of an eye for an eye—and I don't think they should—folks should stop pretending that Kavanaugh or his record is the issue. He is supremely qualified. Although this fact is distressing, Republicans control both the White House and Senate. In comparable circumstances, when President Barack Obama was in office, our party appointed two justices to the Supreme Court. . . .


NATO Should Give Turkey the Boot
U.S.-Turkish relations are mired in the worst crisis of their history. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is demanding that President Trump turn over Mr. Erdogan's sworn enemy, Fethullah Gülen. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, seeks the release of the American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned on the pretext that he had been involved in Turkey's July 2016 coup attempt. The U.S. government has levied economic sanctions on two senior Turkish officials, akin to those imposed on Russian oligarchs after the seizure of Crimea. Turkey responded by freezing the plainly nonexistent Turkish assets of two Trump cabinet members.
As tempers flare and accusations proliferate, it's worth underscoring what is taking place: an unprecedented standoff between the presidents of two North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries.
The two leaders—recognizing one's America First and the other's New Turkey as opposing faces of the same populism—may soon come off their testosterone high and stage-manage a spectacular reconciliation. Mr. Trump has shown himself capable of this with Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, Mr. Erdogan, sensitive to his country's currency woes and dependence on foreign investment, will be looking for a way to halt the escalation without losing face. The conflict nonetheless points to a deeper rift that is too serious to ignore.
As Western democracies worked to stop the spread of Islamist extremism in the Middle East, Turkey and its intelligence services engaged in a double game. Witness the government's delivery of arms to groups affiliated with al Qaeda and later Islamic State in January 2014—several months before the latter's pivotal siege of Kobani.
Or consider the all-out offensive by Turkish planes and artillery against a Kurdish enclave in northeastern Syria earlier this year. Afrin, like the Manbij zone near Aleppo, was under Western protection. Yet the U.S. condoned the attack on its staunchest and most courageous allies in the region, even announcing the pullback of its own troops shortly after.


Nebraska Set to Use Drug Cocktail That Includes Fentanyl in Execution
Nebraska on Tuesday morning is scheduled to carry out the state's first lethal injection and the first execution in more than 20 years, deploying an untested, four-drug cocktail that includes the powerful synthetic opioid, fentanyl.
A court ruling Friday cleared the way for Nebraska prison officials to execute Carey Dean Moore, a 60-year-old convicted murderer who has spent nearly four decades on death row.
Mr. Moore is no longer challenging the death sentence. Days before the scheduled sentence, the U.S. subsidiary of German pharmaceutical company Fresenius Kabi sought to intervene, alleging in federal court in Nebraska that it had likely manufactured two of the lethal injection drugs and the state had improperly obtained them.
The state said it had properly obtained the drugs from a licensed pharmacy. And on Friday, a judge rejected the suit. A federal appeals court on Monday also refused to halt the planned execution.
Nebraska executed three inmates by electrocution in the 1990s and last put to death an inmate in 1997.


Big Labor's Obama Holdover
Democratic National Labor Relations Board member Mark Pearce trained at the Harry Reid school of politics. Yet some advisers are urging President Trump to cut a deal with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to reappoint Mr. Pearce for another five-year term. He might as well then anoint Mr. Schumer as Majority Leader.
The NLRB consists of five members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with an understanding that the current President's party will have three seats. But for the last decade Democrats have used procedural tricks and bullying to tilt the board sharply toward union interests. Mr. Pearce has been the ringmaster.
It started when Mr. Reid, the former Senate Majority Leader, blocked board appointments in George W. Bush's last year in office. Barack Obama then appointed Mr. Pearce, who cut his chops at a Buffalo-based plaintiff law firm. In 2011 Mr. Pearce was made chairman and two years later reappointed for a full five-year term, which expires Aug. 27.
The Pearce NLRB overturned more than 4,000 years of board precedent in 90 some cases. Among other labor hits, Democrats allowed graduate students to unionize; required employers to disclose to unions the names, phone numbers and email addresses of workers; and protected workers who vilify their employers on social media. Mr. Pearce also ruled that employees who had resigned their union membership after their labor contract expired could be dunned for back dues. A D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel overruled his decision in June.
As chairman, Mr. Pearce snubbed Republican colleagues. GOP member Brian Hayes told a member of Congress in 2011 that Mr. Pearce wasn't sharing information and public comments on the board's "quickie election" rule that trampled employers' due process rights. Mr. Pearce then accused Mr. Hayes of threatening to resign to deny the board a quorum, which prompted an investigation by the board's Inspector General.


DeVos's Gainful Deregulation
The Trump Administration's regulatory rollback continues to be overshadowed by the White House circus. In case you missed the news late last week, the Education Department is moving to reverse two Obama rules that would have cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and diminished education options for students who can't afford tuition at Stanford or Georgetown.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is proposing to repeal the Obama Administration's 2014 "gainful employment" rule, which was the tip of the left's spear against for-profit colleges. Under the rule, colleges whose graduates have annual debt payments exceeding 8% of their income would lose federal student aid. Team Obama had grabbed the 8% threshold from a 2006 research paper on mortgage eligibility standards, which the authors acknowledged had no "particular merit or justification" as a gauge of manageable student debt.
The department also applied the rule exclusively to vocational programs—i.e., for-profits—yet Monroe College President Marc Jerome calculated based on the department's College Scorecard that 15.5% of programs at public and 41.5% at nonprofits would have failed the test. When Mrs. DeVos proposed applying the rule to all colleges, nonprofit and public colleges howled.
Colleges noted, among other things, that the metric would punish schools that enroll large numbers of low-income students who take out more debt and those whose graduates choose lower-paying jobs in public service. Many college programs could also be forced to close during recessions as wages dip even as demand for vocational training increases.
Mrs. DeVos has good reason to scrap the rule and is soliciting public comment on adding more granular data to the College Scorecard on student outcomes. This would allow a prospective student to compare the expected earnings of, say, a psychology major at the local community college to a DeVry cyber-security graduate.


An Interview Isn't an Interrogation
I stepped up to the counter at Ben Gurion Airport and handed the young woman my Swedish passport. She eyed me up and down as she typed on her computer. I had taken that same flight, Stockholm to Tel Aviv, dozens of times, but this day was different. The clerk kept my passport and told me to take a seat in a room at the back of the hall.
Two hours later, a member of the Israeli security service interviewed me. She asked about my travel patterns, my family history, my professional and political affiliations. She even asked to see texts on my phone. After a total of four hours, I was free to enter Israel.
I have also been questioned at length while flying into Ethiopia, Germany, Morocco, Russia, Tunisia and the U.S. The inquiries each time followed a similar pattern. So I was surprised to read Peter Beinart's recent article in the Forward complaining about his "detention" at Ben Gurion.
From what I can gather, Mr. Beinart entered the same room I did and was subjected to many of the same questions. But he concluded he was being persecuted for his political views. Few people are further apart politically than Mr. Beinart and me. He is left, I am right; he criticizes Israel, and I have worked for several pro-Israel publications. The facts point to a different conclusion: Israeli border security searches for patterns and flags that go far beyond either Mr. Beinart's or my ego, and the profiling is much more sophisticated than any political spectrum.
To date, I have been questioned at Ben Gurion four times for up to five hours, yet this is the first time I have ever written about it. I have seen enough of the world and traveled to enough dangerous places to be able to differentiate between questioning and detention, thoroughness and threat.


New Jersey Moves to Curb Bear Hunting
New Jersey will ban bear hunting on state land starting this fall's hunting season, under an executive order signed Monday by Gov. Phil Murphy.
Animal-rights activists have been seeking to stop the state's black-bear hunt since 2010, when state environmental officials turned to hunting to help curb the swelling population. Hunters killed 409 black bears last year, according to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, opposes the bear hunt but said in a statement that his authority to stop it extends only to state lands, including forests, parks, recreation areas, historic sites and wildlife management areas. He said a full ban would require action by either the state legislature or the New Jersey Fish and Game Council, an independent group consisting mainly of sportsmen and farmers that issues the state's bear-hunt regulations.
"Before we authorize another hunt we should review all nonlethal options," Mr. Murphy said.
Sierra Club's New Jersey director, Jeff Tittel, said he supported the executive order but was worried that banning hunting on state lands would simply redistribute the hunt to county parkland, municipal open space and private land.


Why Cohen Agreed to Plead Guilty—And Implicate the President
Michael Cohen had many reasons to play ball last weekend when his legal team sat down to talk to federal prosecutors.
The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office had testimony from Mr. Cohen's accountant and business partners, along with bank records, tax filings and loan applications that implicated not only Mr. Cohen in potential criminal activity, but also his wife, who filed taxes jointly with her husband. Prosecutors signaled Mr. Cohen would face nearly 20 criminal counts, potentially carrying a lengthy prison sentence and staggering financial penalties.
Adding to the pressure, David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, provided prosecutors with details about payments Mr. Cohen arranged with women who alleged sexual encounters with President Trump, including Mr. Trump's knowledge of the deals.
This account of how Mr. Cohen went from a pugnacious defender of the president to turning on Mr. Trump is based on details provided by people close to Mr. Cohen and others briefed on the discussions with prosecutors.
For weeks, the president had been distancing himself from Mr. Cohen, including by stopping paying his longtime attorney's legal fees, making clear amid the pressure that he was on his own.


San Francisco vs. the Fish
The good liberals of San Francisco love to advertise their green virtue, such as their recent ban on plastic straws. But that doesn't seem to be protecting them from the same predicament long faced by farmers in California's Central Valley: water shortages due to the decisions of Sacramento regulators.
State overlords have long restricted water deliveries to farmers south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, ostensibly to protect salmon and smelt. But despite the hundreds of billions of gallons every year flushed out to the Pacific Ocean, the fish are still struggling. Thus the State Water Resources Control Board has now proposed restricting water from the San Joaquin River's tributaries as well.
The board this week held public hearings over its plan to double water flows in the Tuolumne, Stanislaus and Merced Rivers to provide more cold water for migrating salmon as well as endangered kayakers and white-water rafters. The plan would mean 290,000 to 673,000 fewer acre feet of water available for human consumption. Each acre foot is enough to sustain one household.
San Francisco pipes its pristine water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite and the Tuolumne, which also provides water to farmers in Modesto in the Central Valley. But San Francisco could face the biggest cutbacks because its water rights are lower than those of farmers.
"The concern is that this would hit commercial and industrial customers," said Steve Ritchie, assistant general manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. A prolonged drought could force San Francisco businesses and residents to curb their water consumption by 40%.


The Forbidden 'I Word'
Shhhhhhhhh. Whatever else you do, please don't mention the "I word" between now and November. That's the public message from Democratic leaders and most of their media friends this week after Michael Cohen's guilty plea and his criminal allegations against President Trump. Between now and Election Day, "impeachment" is the forbidden word.
"If and when the information emerges about that, we'll see," says once and perhaps future House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "It's not a priority on the agenda going forward unless something else comes forward."
Mr. Cohen's charges are serious, says Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, but impeachment talk is "premature" because "more information has to come forward" and it's "too early in the process to be using these words."
Under the coy headline "Can Trump Survive?"—you already know his answer—Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne counsels Democrats that "the argument for impeaching Trump suddenly became very strong, but this does not mean that turning 2018 into an impeachment election is prudent."
And if you believe this misdirection, you probably also believe that Donald Trump didn't canoodle with Stormy Daniels.


Fire Engulfs Major Brazilian Museum
A massive fire engulfed Brazil's largest history and science museum, home to a collection of 20 million items including the Americas' oldest human fossil, Egyptian mummies, archaeological pottery, gigantic tropical beetles and much more.
As firefighters in Rio de Janeiro were going through the burned remains of the Quinta da Boa Vista National Museum on Monday, it seemed unlikely that Luzia—a skeleton that is at least 10,000 years old and that was found in Brazil in 1975—survived the fire. Hundreds if not thousands of other artifacts appeared to have been reduced to cinders.
Local media images showed ashes carpeting burned walls, as city officials feared that the entire building would collapse.
Neighbors called firefighters when they spotted flames on Sunday evening burning through the windows of the museum, the lofty former home of Brazil's 19th-century monarchs where the Declaration of Independence from Portugal was signed in 1822 and the country's equivalent of New York's American Museum of Natural History.
Early responders found nearby hydrants with low pressure, which hobbled the operation, Rio's Fire Department said in a statement. Firefighters used water from their trucks and from a neighboring lake in a six-hour effort to tame the flames that lit up Rio's warm night.


Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel Won't Seek Re-Election
CHICAGO—Rahm Emanuel said he won't seek re-election as mayor of Chicago after two terms marked by downtown development but also a wave of gun violence that returned the city's murder rate to 1990s levels.
The announcement marked an abrupt reversal for Mr. Emanuel, who raised a substantial campaign war chest and for months had been laying the groundwork to run for a third term. But slipping popularity left him facing headwinds for re-election early next year, with a crowded field of opponents.
"This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime," Mr. Emanuel, 58 years old, said in a statement Tuesday. "You hire us to get things done—and pass the torch when we've done our best to do what you hired us to do."
Mr. Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff and Democratic congressman, took over in 2011 from a predecessor of more than two decades, Democrat Richard M. Daley, who had papered over the city's financial problems and left four of the main pensions underfunded by nearly $30 billion. Mr. Emanuel addressed those problems by raising property taxes and extricating the city from a series of derivative deals linked to the city's bond debt. With some deft political and fiscal footwork he was also able to raise the money to rebuild the city's riverfront and two of its train lines.
Between 2011 and 2016, the city added 300,000 jobs and dozens of corporate headquarters including Conagra Brands, McDonald's and Archer Daniels Midland. On top of that, a tech sector flourished and attracted offices for such behemoths as Google. Today, dozens of cranes dot the skyline as developers race to add more downtown office space and high-rise housing.


Progressive Democrat Upends Massachusetts Primary Race
In the latest upset among Democrats, Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilor who ran as a progressive activist, beat 10-term Democratic Rep. Michael Capuano on Tuesday in a Massachusetts House primary.
Ms. Pressley becomes the second Democrat to defeat an incumbent House member in a 2018 primary. She rode energy from the party's resistance to President Trump to topple Mr. Capuano, who Federal Election Commission records show raised about twice as much money as she did.
Ms. Pressley's victory instantly thrusts her into the ranks of the new Democratic stars of 2018, alongside New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the only other Democrat to oust an incumbent member of Congress this year, and Andrew Gillum, who last week won an upset victory to become the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida.
Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Gillum, Ms. Pressley is a minority candidate who was lifted by the progressive energy powering the Democratic Party in the era of Trump. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Pressley shared campaign staff and appeared together at a June campaign fundraiser in Manhattan.
Mr. Capuano conceded the race with less than 10% of the returns having been counted; the Associated Press within the hour declared her the winner. With no Republican or minor-party candidates on the district's general election ballot, she will enter Congress in January as the first African-American House member from Massachusetts.


Ex-Trump Adviser George Papadopoulos Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison
Ex-Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was sentenced Friday to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian intermediary, giving special counsel Robert Mueller a second prison term from his 15-month inquiry.
U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ordered the incarceration, saying that he couldn't avoid imposing prison time given the gravity of the investigation. But he said he was moved by what he viewed as Mr. Papadopoulos's "genuine remorse."
At a 90-minute court hearing, Mr. Papadopoulos said he had made a "terrible mistake" and wanted to have a second chance.
Mr. Papadopoulos wasn't taken into custody. He will begin serving his sentence at a later date.
Earlier Friday, President Trump said aboard Air Force One that he doesn't know Mr. Papadopoulos.


A Democratic Reformer Tries to Hang On in New England
Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo is an endangered species within the Democratic Party—a reformer. Or so she tried to be.
Ms. Raimondo took on the government unions as state treasurer in 2011, championing bold pension reforms that slashed the state's unfunded liability by nearly half. Despite opposition from unions, she won the Democratic nomination for governor in 2014 and squeaked out a narrow win in the general election.
But the party has since lurched further left, leaving her stretched like Gumby. Despite shifting left, she's drawn a progressive primary challenger, Matt Brown. The result next Wednesday will provide an indication of whether a Democratic government reformer can survive the party's left-wing purge.
In 2011, during Ms. Raimondo's first year as treasurer, Rhode Island's unemployment rate hovered around 11%—third-highest in the country—and the state was bleeding red ink and workers. Ms. Raimondo spearheaded reforms that shifted state employees to hybrid pension plans with a 401(k)-style component, boosted the retirement age, and suspended cost-of-living adjustments.
The Democratic left hasn't forgiven her, so she's spent the 31⁄2 years of her governorship atoning for her apostasy as she tries to revive economic growth. It hasn't been easy.


The Manafort Plea
Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Friday finally squeezed all the resistance out of Paul Manafort. The former Trump campaign chairman agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, but the important question is whether he knows anything about the alleged Donald Trump-Russia collusion tale that made Mr. Manafort a target.
As with his conviction last month on other charges, Mr. Manafort's Friday guilty plea concerns his business as a political fixer long before he worked for the Trump campaign. He copped to two conspiracy charges, though prosecutors dropped five others ranging from money laundering to false statements. The deal spares Mr. Manafort a second trial and imposes a 10-year cap on prison time on all of the charges against him. He also agreed to forfeit four homes and other assets and cooperate with the Mueller probe.
Mr. Manafort had long resisted Mr. Mueller's full-court legal squeeze, which included a raid on Mr. Manafort's home, prison time and solitary confinement before trial, and dozens of charges that could have put him behind bars for the rest of his life. The previous verdicts and the prospect of more convictions and mounting legal bills appear to have pushed Mr. Manafort to plead guilty.
And who knows? Maybe Mr. Manafort will be the Rosetta Stone of the Trump-Russia narrative, even if there's still no evidence that he is. The longtime Beltway lobbyist has consistently said he has no information to offer on Russia since there was no collusion.
This is supported by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which investigated Mr. Manafort and found no evidence of an election conspiracy. On Friday Politico reported that a source close to the Manafort legal team repeated that "the cooperation agreement does not involve the Trump campaign. . . . There was no collusion with Russia."


Seven Countries Join to Hunt Ships Smuggling Fuel to North Korea
WASHINGTON—The U.S. is convening a multinational coalition to significantly expand surveillance of ships smuggling fuel to North Korea in violation of United Nations sanctions, American military officials said.
The coalition is the first unified international effort to monitor the ship traffic in the year since the Trump administration launched its "maximum-pressure" sanctions campaign, aimed at strong-arming North Korea into abandoning its nuclear and missile programs. Surveillance efforts until now have been a hodgepodge of intelligence-sharing, U.S. officials said.
More than 50 personnel from allied countries will be hosted aboard the USS Blue Ridge, an American command ship stationed in Yokosuka, Japan. Special quarters, what's known as the Enforcement Coordination Center, have been created on the ship for the operations.
The coalition, not previously disclosed, will include the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Canada—the U.S.'s partners in the Five-Eyes intelligence alliance—as well as Japan and South Korea. France is contributing at least one person for now.
Coalition countries are also contributing warships and military surveillance aircraft to better spot illicit shipments.


Border Patrol Agent Arrested in Suspected Serial Killings
A U.S. Border Patrol agent was arrested Saturday on suspicion of killing four prostitutes and attempting to kidnap another victim.
South Texas authorities said Juan David Ortiz, 35, an intelligence supervisor with the Border Patrol and a 10-year veteran of the agency, targeted prostitutes.
"The county, the city can rest assured that we have a serial killer in custody," Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar said at a news conference on Saturday.
Isidro Alaniz, district attorney for Webb County, said that the case broke open after a woman, whom Mr. Ortiz attempted to kidnap at gunpoint, managed to escape on Friday. She went to local authorities, and early Saturday, Texas state troopers who were on the lookout for Mr. Ortiz approached him. He fled and was found hiding in a truck in a parking lot in the border city of Laredo. Mr. Ortiz was arrested without incident by Texas Rangers, authorities said.
Law enforcement said the deaths took place over the past two weeks.

Since Friday, when Hurricane Florence made landfall on the coast of North Carolina, the story has been about men and women fighting to survive a death struggle with windblown water. So far the people of North and South Carolina and all who have pitched in to help them have given Florence a good fight.
The devastation from the hurricane's 11-foot storm surge and relentless rain is significant. The hurricane had killed an estimated 15 people as of Sunday. Still, it is impossible not to be moved by the determination of North and South Carolinians to survive this storm and the acts of heroism on their behalf.
Foreign Edition Podcast Foreign Edition Podcast Foreign Edition podcast: East Asian contagion, China's economy and Brexit's messy politics. Deaths have been minimized in large part because, with enough advance warning, most people heeded public directives to move inland. Typically in these circumstances, though, there are individuals who can't flee because of age or health, or didn't flee due to bad judgment. Rescue teams, often led by the National Guard, have worked around the clock to save the stranded. Skilled rescuers have arrived from New York, Texas, Georgia, Missouri and elsewhere. Examples of looting have been rare. A Journal story Sunday on the Florence rescuers quoted National Guard Sgt. Nicholas Muhar, who captured the simple reality of how so much good work gets done fast. "We've just been running and running and running," said Sgt. Muhar. "It's just: next thing, next thing, next thing. Just do it. Get it done." The impressive initial fight against Florence has provided a template of civic action for the great and expensive rebuilding that lies ahead for North and South Carolina.


FEMA Chief Says He Wasn't Asked to Resign Over Vehicle Use
WASHINGTON—The top official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday said he has never been asked to resign over an internal investigation involving vehicle use, and he echoed President Trump in casting doubt on a government-backed report on the number of deaths from last year's hurricanes in Puerto Rico.
FEMA Administrator Brock Long said he was cooperating with the investigation into frequent travel—and the use of a caravan of government vehicles—between his North Carolina home and Washington, D.C. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had discussed the alleged improper use of vehicles with Mr. Long, and told him he ought to resign if the matter were true.
"Secretary Nielsen has never asked me to resign," Mr. Long said on NBC's "Meet the Press." He added that the vehicles provide him with secure communications capabilities that have been used by previous administrators.
Mr. Long, speaking from the FEMA operations center as Florence lashes the Carolinas, said officials would work to get vehicle-use policies "cleared up and pushed forward."
Mr. Long routinely traveled from Washington to his home in North Carolina using government vehicles staffed by FEMA employees who often stayed in nearby hotels, according to the people familiar with the matter. Since taking the job, Mr. Long has spent some 150 days in North Carolina, including weekends and holidays, these people said.


Why China Is Brutally Suppressing Muslims
The repression of the Turkic Uighur Muslim community in western China—including the reported internment of up to a million people in secret camps—is a key part of Beijing's new imperial policy. Only by understanding the dynamics of Chinese empire can one grasp this brutal campaign.
Xinjiang, a province home to millions of Uighurs, translates to "New Dominion." The area has been historically and geographically known as East Turkestan. Though the Chinese state has existed for more than 3,500 years, Xinjiang first became part of China's Qing Dynasty only in the mid-18th century. Since then it has often been in a condition the British explorer Fitzroy Maclean labeled as "sustained turbulence."
When I first traveled through Xinjiang and interviewed Uighurs in 1994, their hatred of what they considered ethnic Han Chinese occupiers was complete. "This is Turkestan, not China. Chinese don't learn our language, and many of us don't learn theirs. Even on a personal level, relations are bad," one young Uighur man told me.
Relations have worsened since. A deep, unspoken reason why China has never liberalized is its authoritarian leadership fears ethnic rebellion. Uprisings of this sort happened in the outer reaches of the Soviet Union after it liberalized in the 1980s. So China has kept its political system closed, while simultaneously pushing into Central Asia through diplomacy and economic interventions. It is building vast infrastructure projects in the region to ally with the Turkic Muslims of the former Soviet Union and deny China's own Muslims a friendly rear base for future rebellion. China's push beyond its borders ultimately has to do with demons within.
Because China historically has never been secure on land, particularly in this western region, it has not had the luxury of going to sea. Except for the Indian Ocean exploits of Adm. Zheng He during the early Ming Dynasty, China has had a demonstrably weak naval tradition. Yet China, mostly secure on land today, aims to posses the world's largest navy. The intensifying suppression of the Uighur Muslims is the final act in this process. The Belt and Road Initiative—forging transportation corridors by land and sea across Eurasia—requires the complete subjugation of the Uighur population.


Number of Fatal Drug Overdoses in NYC Increased in 2017, Data Shows
The number of people who die of drug overdoses in New York City rose in 2017, but the rate at which people are dying is slowing, according to new data released Monday by the city's health department.
There were 1,487 confirmed unintentional drug overdose deaths in 2017, up 62 from 2016. The rate of unintentional deaths increased for the seventh straight year; one New Yorker dies every six hours from an overdose.
The rate of fatal drug overdoses remained relatively flat, however, with 21.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2017, compared with 20.7 in 2016 and 13.7 in 2015.
Officials for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said that fentanyl—a powerful, synthetic opioid—was detected in more than half of the deaths. Fentanyl, which is increasingly mixed with non-opioid drugs like cocaine, has driven the overall increase in overdose deaths between 2014 and 2017, health officials reported.
Heroin was the second most common drug involved in deaths.


Kavanaugh Accuser Wants 'Full Investigation' Before Senate Hearing
WASHINGTON—Attorneys for the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault said she wants a full investigation of the allegations before she testifies on Capitol Hill, throwing into doubt a planned Monday hearing that would have pitted her word against that of the Supreme Court nominee.
In a letter Tuesday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), attorneys for California college professor Christine Blasey Ford asked for "a full investigation by law-enforcement officials" to "ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a nonpartisan manner."
Mr. Grassley indicated the committee wasn't willing to wait for a full FBI investigation of Dr. Ford's allegations.
"Dr. Ford's testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events. Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay," Mr. Grassley said in a statement Tuesday night.
On Sunday, Dr. Ford made public her accusations from when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a high-school party. Dr. Ford, now 51 years old, alleged that Judge Kavanaugh, 53, and one of his friends, pulled her into a bedroom, where Judge Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations, saying no such incident occurred.


Is Germany Slouching Toward Weimar Again?
Agitators and their opponents were marching through town. In-your-face Nazi symbols were brandished. Racist and anti-Semitic slogans filled the air. Arms were raised in a Hitler salute. Bottles were hurled into a Jewish restaurant. One person died; many were wounded. The police couldn't separate the combatants.
Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017?
No, Chemnitz at the end of last month: a city of 120,000 in former East Germany. On Aug. 25, right-wing groups took to the streets in reaction to the alleged murder of a local man by Arab immigrants. The clash came at a tense time, as Chancellor Angela Merkel's shaky coalition was sinking in the polls. If there were an election today, the government might lose its majority.
As horrifying as the clashes were between antifa and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, only the deranged would argue that the U.S. was descending into fascism. But history keeps hounding Germany. Even after 70 years of continuous democratic development, the shibboleth of the day is "Weimar": Germany's first try at popular rule after its defeat in World War I. The experiment lasted only 14 years, collapsing into Hitler's hands in 1933. Today a Stern magazine columnist sees Germany at a "tipping point," about to degenerate into a "failed state." The daily Frankfurter Rundschau trumpets: "Berlin is turning into Weimar." Princeton historian Harold James conjures up the "specter of Weimar."
Punditry invites hype. In this case, the Weimar analogy is as persuasive as the flat-earth theory. None of the conditions that conspired to kill German democracy in the 1920s are present in today's Federal Republic.


Congress Passes Bill Updating Music Copyright Protections for the Spotify Era
A bill overhauling music copyright law for the digital age won approval in the House of Representatives, the final hurdle before making its way to President Trump's desk.
The Music Modernization Act, or MMA, creates a new music-licensing system and updates copyright law to help songwriters get paid more when people listen to their work online. After passing unanimously in the Senate last week, the bill was renamed for Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who introduced the legislation and is himself a songwriter.
The central part of the bill calls for the creation of a body to administer royalties owed to songwriters by music-streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. The legislation would streamline the complicated way those services get access to millions of songs and pay for the rights to carry them.
The entity charged with creating a comprehensive database of musical works and those who own the rights to them would be operated by music publishers and funded by music-streaming services. Those services would be granted all-inclusive licenses for downloads and on-demand streaming of songs listed in the database.
Another piece of the legislation would ensure performers of songs recorded before 1972 are paid when their music is played. Currently, so-called legacy artists aren't paid for use of their music by streaming services.


Trump Backs Off Timetable for North Korean Denuclearization
UNITED NATIONS—Plans for a summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un advanced as the president said the U.S. would no longer insist that Pyongyang move to rapidly dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Trump told a press conference on Wednesday that he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to get into a "time game" in his negotiations with North Korea.
"If it takes two years, three years or five months, doesn't matter," Mr. Trump said.
Those comments differed markedly from earlier administration positions. Mr. Pompeo said in June that the administration hoped to achieve "major disarmament" of North Korea's nuclear arsenal during Mr. Trump's first term in office.
Mr. Pompeo repeated that point earlier this month, saying the process of "rapid denuclearization" should be completed by January 2021.


The Attack on Kavanaugh Is Un-American
A reputation is a fragile thing. Last week was a testament to that simple truth. Within hours of being accused of an unsubstantiated and uncorroborated three-decades-old assault, Judge Brett Kavanaugh's reputation as a highly respected jurist with an unblemished personal record was permanently damaged. Many rushed to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty merely because he had been accused. Democrats all too happily called for him to withdraw his Supreme Court nomination, while his accuser's lawyer basked in the left's glory for slowing a Supreme Court nomination that seemed a sure thing.
As the #MeToo tidal wave crests, it is crucial to remember what happens when we blindly assume the truth of allegations rather than require evidence and adhere to the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty. I have seen firsthand what happens when people mindlessly follow preconceived narratives, disregard evidence, and indiscriminately believe accusers. I represented Nicole Eramo, a dean at the University of Virginia, who was victimized by one of the most notorious false rape accusations in recent history.
Rolling Stone magazine claimed in 2014 that Ms. Eramo had tried to cover up a horrific gang rape at a UVA fraternity. The campus exploded in protest, and Ms. Eramo—who had dedicated her career to helping survivors of sexual assault and had supported the purported victim—became a national villain, receiving public condemnation and death threats.
Although we were ultimately able to vindicate Ms. Eramo publicly, winning a $3 million jury verdict for defamation, we faced the tremendously difficult task of proving what had not happened: that the reported gang rape did not occur, and that Ms. Eramo did not dismiss the accuser's allegations. That required months of litigation—not to mention the public backlash my law firm endured by daring to ask a purported victim of sexual assault questions about her allegations.
Judge Kavanaugh finds himself in a similar unenviable position: being expected to prove a negative. To vindicate himself in the eyes of those who assume his guilt, he must show that something else happened, for example that he was somewhere else when the incident—whose location is itself unspecified—allegedly occurred. To make matters worse, the purported assault took place before cellphones, text messages, emails—making it hard to find contemporaneous documents to demonstrate the falsity of the claim.


Trump Says He Doesn't Want to Fire Rod Rosenstein
WASHINGTON—President Trump said he doesn't want to fire Rod Rosenstein and may postpone a highly anticipated meeting with the deputy attorney general scheduled for Thursday.
"My preference is to keep him and let him finish up," Mr. Trump said at a news conference in New York, adding that Mr. Rosenstein has denied accusations about discussing the possibility of removing the president from office.
Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet with Mr. Rosenstein in Washington on Thursday, but the president said he might delay that meeting because he didn't want to distract from the hearing scheduled to hear from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford.
"I don't want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick," Mr. Trump said.
The president has told advisers that he wants to hear directly from Mr. Rosenstein about reports that he discussed secretly recording the president and recruiting cabinet members to remove him from office, according to people who have spoken to the president.


The Justices Can Undo a Constitutional Catch-22
Rose Mary Knick lives on a 90-acre plot of farmland in Pennsylvania that her family has owned since 1970. But according to the local government, the property isn't entirely hers. In 2012 it enacted an ordinance requiring owners of "cemeteries" to allow unrestricted public access to their land and submit to inspections. In April 2013, a township code-enforcement officer searched Ms. Knick's land without her consent, concluded that some stones there were actually grave markers and deemed part of the area a "cemetery" subject to the law. If Ms. Knick refuses access to inspectors or anyone else, she could be fined up to $600 a day.
On Wednesday the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Knick v. Township of Scott. The justices have an opportunity to ensure that people whose property rights have been violated by state and local governments can get their day in federal court the same as victims of violations of other constitutional rights.
In most situations, giving outsiders a blanket right to trespass on private land counts as a taking under the Fifth Amendment, and the government must pay the owner "just compensation." Yet a misguided Supreme Court decision prevents federal courts from even considering Ms. Knick's case. Although she is before the high court, no federal judge has considered her case on the merits.
Ms. Knick is not alone. The town of Ponce Inlet, Fla., encouraged homeowners Simone and Lyder Johnson to spend several million dollars preparing to develop 10 properties they owned in the area, only to forbid the development after the balance of power on the Town Council shifted in favor of the project's opponents.
The roadblock standing in Ms. Knick's, the Johnsons' and so many others' way is Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank (1985). Under this precedent, a plaintiff who claims the government has taken his property by regulation cannot file a case in federal court until he has first obtained a "final decision" from state regulatory agencies and has "exhausted" all possible state-court remedies. Even then it is often impossible to bring a federal case, because procedural rules generally bar federal judges from reviewing cases decided in state court.


'Takings Clause' Should Protect All Property
Your editorial "A Brave New Habitat" (Oct. 1) states that "the four sitting liberal Justices may not want to rein in the administrative state." The issue centers on the definition of "habitat." The more important issue is: What is the definition of theft? Once the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has declared the property owned by Weyerhaeuser "critical habitat," it has also declared the property to be financially worthless. A corporation has the means to pursue an injustice like this through the legal system. But what options does the average powerless small landowner, without the deep-pocketed financial wherewithal of a corporation, have?
I have personally experienced, as have many others in my state, such an action by the federal government to the detriment of my own financial and emotional well-being. Regardless of the judicial philosophy of a sitting justice, one might hope the courts would view the actions of the government as a clear violation of the Constitution's "takings clause." The Supreme Court should view with a skeptical eye this unaccountable and unfettered power to confiscate that agencies have granted unto themselves.

High Court Questions Government's Power to Detain Aliens Long After Prison
WASHINGTON—Supreme Court justices Wednesday challenged Justice Department claims that federal law requires mandatory detention of certain immigrants that Homeland Security agents arrest years or decades after they had completed sentences for even minor crimes.
While the outcome was far from clear, the argument suggested a possible split between President Trump's two appointees.
Justice Neil Gorsuch, beginning his sophomore term, questioned whether federal law could be so arbitrary as to let immigration authorities take no action against an alien for decades — and then, when it does, hold him with no chance even to argue for bail.
"Thirty years, and the government was aware of him the entire time and chose not to act" until then, Justice Gorsuch said. "Is there any limit on the government's power?"
But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, on his second day on the bench, said severity was the whole point of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which Congress enacted after Republicans took control in 1995.


Next Month the People Vote on Kavanaugh
Many Republicans celebrated Justice Brett Kavanaugh's swearing-in Monday as the end of a bitter confirmation battle. But the game isn't over. GOP candidates' success in the midterm elections may depend on the narrative that emerges from the Kavanaugh showdown.
Consider two recent surveys released before the Senate voted Saturday to confirm Justice Kavanaugh. After the riveting Judiciary Committee hearing on Sept. 27, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll asked: "If there is still a doubt about whether the charges are true, do you think Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed?" Respondents said no by 52% to 40%.
A Harvard-Harris poll released Oct. 1 asked: "If the FBI review of these allegations finds no corroboration of the accusation of sexual assault, should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed?" Sixty percent said yes and 40% no, with 86% of Republicans, 58% of independents and even 40% of Democrats supporting confirmation.
The 20-point swing between these two survey questions shows public opinion is malleable. One-fifth of Americans are up in the air. Where they land Election Day could depend on whether they feel doubts remain about the Kavanaugh allegations or are convinced there's no corroboration for them.
That's why Democrats are attacking the Federal Bureau of Investigation's report as "a complete coverup" (Sen. Jeff Merkley), "not a search for the truth" (Sen. Kamala Harris) and "a whitewash" (Sen. Richard Blumenthal). Expect this to continue.


Debating the Lessons of Brett Kavanaugh and Gregory Peck
Regarding Allysia Finley's "Will the Senate Kill a Mockingbird?" (op-ed, Oct. 4): To compare the Senate investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the criminal trial of a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman in a small southern town in the 1930s is, frankly, bizarre. Judge Kavanaugh has emerged from this controversy with his current lifestyle and career intact, able to count on a large group of powerful supporters. In Harper Lee's tale, Tom Robinson was fighting for his life, wholly dependent on a single ally, and facing dim prospects regardless of the outcome. The comparison is highly inaccurate.
Ken Swensen
Redding, Conn.
Ms. Finley rightly compares Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings to the unfair trial of Tom Robinson, but she wrongly suggests that the Democrats' persecution of Mr. Kavanaugh is motivated by their willingness to believe women victims. Democrats have a long record of disbelieving victims—even when there is significant evidence of guilt—whenever the allegations threaten their power. Furthermore, the Democrats' opposition to Judge Kavanaugh has nothing to do with his qualifications, integrity or conduct. Rather, just like Tom was convicted because he was black, the Democrats rejected Judge Kavanaugh because he is a conservative.


Inside the Texas Tent City Housing More Than 1,000 Migrant Teens
Tornillo, Texas—The sprawling tent city in the desert about an hour southeast of El Paso was supposed to serve as home for a few hundred unaccompanied immigrant children for about a month.
But since opening in mid-June, its operations have rapidly expanded. It is now home to roughly 1,200 teenage boys and 300 teenage girls. There is room for about 3,800, though 1,400 beds are in case of an emergency such as a hurricane near another shelter.
Officially, the massive complex just north of the Mexican border is a temporary, emergency "influx shelter" overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement.
But in practical terms, it is home, school and playground for migrant teens who were arrested after illegally crossing the U.S. border. Most are now asking for asylum and will spend an average of two months total in the government's care.
Government officials opened the Tornillo shelter to reporters Friday as part of an effort to combat criticisms of conditions inside the facility.


Brexit Talks Stall Ahead of Key Summit
BRUSSELS—Negotiations over Britain's departure from the European Union suffered a setback Sunday as the two sides failed to resolve differences, chiefly over how to avoid the re-emergence of a physical border in Ireland.
Both sides had hoped that a deal on a withdrawal agreement would be broadly settled when EU leaders meet at a summit starting Wednesday. The failure to bridge those differences during an unscheduled visit to Brussels Sunday by U.K. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab slims the odds of a deal this week.
The setback is likely to reawaken concerns of a no-deal Brexit, and raises the question of whether the two sides have the political space to solve the thorniest problems, of which the Irish border is paramount.
The border has been a past flashpoint in Ireland's barely submerged sectarian conflict and negotiators are seeking to avoid the need for renewed checks between Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with the rest of the U.K., and the Irish Republic, which is staying in the EU.
In a statement, the U.K. government said negotiators had in the last few days "made real progress in a number of key areas."


An Asian-American Dissident at Harvard
Cambridge, Mass.
My university goes on trial in Boston this week. A lawsuit alleging that Harvard discriminates against Asian-Americans may ultimately determine whether race will be considered in future college admissions.
My parents are among the many Asians who journeyed from their homeland to provide better opportunities for their children. They came from Laos, one of the few countries that are still communist. Their experience in education has shaped how I view my own: Access to education in Laos is limited, and what is taught is mostly communist propaganda. When I was growing up, my parents stressed the value of real education. I attended urban public schools and now have the privilege of going to Harvard—a privilege I hope more Asian-Americans will enjoy if the lawsuit succeeds.
It's not easy to voice my opinion about Harvard's admissions policies on campus. For all the talk about "diversity," many fellow students won't tolerate my views. I often get comments such as, "How can you be against affirmative action? That's racist," and "You should be grateful to Harvard. Why are you critical of them?"
Of course I'm grateful for the opportunity to go to Harvard despite my Asian background. But why shouldn't I be critical? Contemporary affirmative action has failed millions of Asians pursuing the American dream. The plaintiffs challenging Harvard have already shown that Asian-Americans are held to higher standards than others, and often their rejection boils down to the single factor of race. While the Supreme Court has ruled that race can be considered in admissions, it cannot be the only factor.


Macedonia's Parliament Approves Name-Change Deal With Greece
Macedonia's parliament approved a constitutional revision bringing a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece one step closer to a resolution that would unblock the country's membership to the West's most powerful clubs.
The vote took place late Friday behind closed doors after hours of delay amid high tensions. It came on the heels of accusations—leveled by the deal's supporters and opponents—of threats, blackmail and bribery. In all, 80 members of parliament backed the deal, which changes the name of the Balkan nation to "North Macedonia," securing the two-thirds majority required in the 120-seat parliament.
"This is a historic day for our country..We will access the two most powerful organizations of the world very soon," Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said after the vote.
The process has been closely watched by the U.S. and the European Union, which pressed heavily the deal's ratification. The West sees Macedonia's entry to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and EU as a vital step toward stabilizing a region where it has increasingly vied for influence with Russia.
A number of Western leaders have visited Macedonia to lend support to the name deal, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who warned that Russia was actively working against the agreement.


Lawmakers Push Trump on Saudi Account of Khashoggi Killing
WASHINGTON—A divide immediately arose Saturday between President Trump's initial acceptance of Saudi Arabia's response to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and senators in both parties who stepped up calls for sanctions and pressed the administration to do its own investigation.
"The story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water," said Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "They can undergo their own investigation, but the U.S. administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi's murder."
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) was even more dubious. "To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement," he tweeted. "It's hard to find this latest 'explanation' as credible."
Democrats criticized the Trump administration for not applying more pressure to the Saudi royal family. "If ever a story reeked of a coverup, it is this one," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). "Our country must not be complicit in this coverup."
The Saudis said Friday that Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the government who had been living in the U.S., died following an altercation inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Mr. Khashoggi was at the consulate for marriage-related documents. The Saudi statement said 18 Saudi citizens had been detained pending the final results of a continuing investigation.


Saudis Reel From Latest Official Version of Journalist's Death
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia—The latest twist in an official narrative over how a government critic died inside Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate has eroded the government's credibility domestically and deepened concerns about expressing views in public.
For weeks, Saudi officials and state-aligned media have dismissed allegations that Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as attempts on the part of its enemies and critics to smear the kingdom's reputation. Officials initially insisted Mr. Khashoggi had walked out of the consulate after his appointment on Oct. 2, and that they were trying to establish what happened to the senior journalist, who was 59 years old at the time he disappeared.
Early Saturday, the Saudi government said Mr. Khashoggi died following a "brawl and a fistfight" inside the consulate. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Sunday said Saudi authorities are working with their Turkish counterparts to establish what happened to Mr. Khashoggi's body.
The government said 18 people have been detained so far as a result of the incident.
Mr. Jubeir said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's day-to-day ruler, had no knowledge of the operation targeting Mr. Khashoggi.


Supreme Court Blocks Quiz of Commerce Secretary in Census Controversy
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday shielded Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross from being questioned under oath about the government's decision to ask people on the 2020 census whether they are U.S. citizens.
The court, in a brief written order, stayed the effect of a lower-court ruling that had required Mr. Ross to sit for a deposition conducted by lawyers for a group of 18 states and other plaintiffs who are challenging the lawfulness of the administration's move to add the citizenship question.
The justices, however, did leave open the challengers' ability to gather information from elsewhere in the Trump administration, including by questioning Justice Department lawyer John Gore about his connection to the citizenship question.
The court's mixed outcome came in response to an emergency request by the Justice Department, which sought to shut down the depositions and other legal discovery sought by the plaintiffs ahead of a high-stakes trial scheduled to begin Nov. 5. The court, as is customary in emergency rulings, didn't explain its reasoning. It gave the Justice Department until Oct. 29 to file more legal papers in the case. If the government does so, the stay protecting Mr. Ross from questioning will remain in place indefinitely while legal proceedings continue.
The court's action was one of the first that included the participation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed on Oct. 6. Two justices—conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas—registered a partial dissent, saying they would have granted all of the government's request to shield Trump officials from being questioned.


Rewriting the Fourteenth Amendment
President Trump really, really wants to make the midterm election about immigration, and for a while it looked like he had an edge due to Democratic excess. But with this week's pre-election vow to end birthright citizenship in America by executive order, Mr. Trump has driven into his own constitutional ditch.
Mr. Trump has the political high ground as long as he is trying to stop lawlessness or deter migrant caravans mobilized by left-wing groups in Central America. Even deploying soldiers to the border in nonmilitary roles can be justified to assist immigration agents overwhelmed by asylum seekers. The U.S. has to send a signal that no one can bum-rush the border—not least to deter migrants from making a trip that will end in disappointment, or worse.
By contrast, the birth citizenship gambit puts Mr. Trump on the wrong side of immigration law and politics. Did Michael Cohen give him this legal advice?
***
The right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil is derived from the Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." This is the common law doctrine of jus soli, or right of the soil.
Opponents of birth citizenship try to obscure this plain meaning by interpreting "subject to the jurisdiction" as applying only to those who owe allegiance to America. Because alien parents owe allegiance to a different sovereign, the argument goes, their children have no right to citizenship.


New York's Attorney General Candidates Spar in Debate
The two candidates vying to be New York's top legal officer clashed over public corruption, prosecutorial independence and President Trump on Tuesday in what is likely to be their only debate, one week before the general election.
The attorney general candidates are Democrat Letitia James, who serves as New York City's public advocate, and Republican Keith Wofford, a co-managing partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP. Either candidate would make history as the state's first African-American attorney general. Ms. James would be the first woman elected to the post.
The attorney general race became unexpectedly competitive in May when Eric Schneiderman, the former officeholder, resigned following allegations, which he denied, that he had physically abused women. Barbara Underwood, the current attorney general, was appointed by lawmakers and isn't seeking re-election.
During Tuesday's debate, on Spectrum News NY1, the candidates sought to highlight their differences. Mr. Wofford accused Ms. James of not being able to "police her teammates," a reference to accusations that she is too cozy with Democratic Party leaders.
Ms. James noted Mr. Wofford's firm had represented an opioid manufacturer that has been sued by the attorney general's office. She criticized him for questioning the office's lawsuits against Exxon Mobil Corp. and Mr. Trump's family foundation.


Pittsburgh and the Press
How seriously should Americans take media folk who say the President's press criticism is too harsh even as they blame him for murders he did not commit?
This column is not in the habit of labelling all shoddy reporting and commentary as "fake news." The term should perhaps be reserved for discussions among non-doctors on cable news programs who purport to issue long-distance diagnoses of Donald Trump's mental health. But who can defend the current widespread media effort to blame the President for a murderous rampage in Pittsburgh by a gunman who was explicitly anti-Trump?
Not that it's fair to blame national political figures for all the acts committed by their supporters either. But Paul Krugman of the New York Times suggests that whatever the motivation, whatever the political affiliation of a particular criminal and regardless of the facts of each case, Mr. Trump is at fault:
In case you hadn't noticed, we're in the midst of a wave of hate crimes. Just in the past few days, bombs were mailed to a number of prominent Democrats, plus CNN. Then, a gunman massacred 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Meanwhile, another gunman killed two African-Americans at a Louisville supermarket, after first trying unsuccessfully to break into a black church — if he had gotten there an hour earlier, we would probably have had another mass murder.
All of these hate crimes seem clearly linked to the climate of paranoia and racism deliberately fostered by Donald Trump and his allies in Congress and the media.
This latest column in the Times is obviously compelling evidence that Mr. Krugman is no better at analyzing violent attacks than he is at predicting the pace of economic growth or forecasting stock market moves. But even a casual news consumer knows that such moral confusion has not been confined to Mr. Krugman since the Saturday massacre. And history has shown that it really has nothing in particular to do with Mr. Trump.
"Conservatives Don't Get to Mourn," is the headline on an insightful piece by Karol Markowicz, who writes in National Review today:


Notable & Quotable: Tribune of the Gentrifiers
David Friedlanderwriting in Politico Magazine, November/December:
New York's 14th Congressional District is more than 70 percent people of color, and 50 percent Hispanic. [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez, who was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican mother, fit the district's changing demographics, and neatly fit a larger narrative of a national Democratic Party in which increasing progressivism and diversity go hand and hand.
But a closer examination of the data tells a different story. Ocasio-Cortez's best precincts were . . . highly educated, whiter and richer than the district as a whole. In those neighborhoods, Ocasio-Cortez clobbered Crowley by 70 percent or more. [Rep. Joe] Crowley's best precincts, meanwhile, were the working-class African-American enclave of LeFrak City, where he got more than 60 percent of the vote, and portions of heavily Hispanic Corona. He pulled some of his best numbers in Ocasio-Cortez's heavily Latino and African-American neighborhood of Parkchester, in the Bronx—beating her by more than 25 points on her home turf.
Ocasio-Cortez . . . hadn't been all but vaulted into Congress by the party's diversity, or a blue-collar base looking to even the playing field. She won because she had galvanized the college-educated gentrifiers who are displacing those people. "It was the Bernie Bros," one top Crowley adviser said as he surveyed the wreckage the day after the election. "They killed us."


New York Unveils $17 Billion Plan to Ease School Overcrowding
New York City officials proposed Thursday a $17 billion capital plan for the nation's largest school system that would add buildings and tens of thousands of seats for students to help relieve overcrowding.
The five-year plan aims to fulfill Mayor Bill de Blasio's promise more than two years ago to create 83,000 seats citywide, officials said. They said by the end of the plan's term in June 2024, most of these seats would be available, but some would have locations found for them and still need to be built.
The proposal represents the administration's effort to keep up with shifts in student population in a high-price city where neighborhood demographics and families' choices change quickly, leaving some popular schools bursting and others with empty classrooms. The proposal would pay for 38,000 seats that weren't already funded in prior plans, officials said.
The proposal would add air conditioning so that all classrooms would be cool by 2021, boost internet bandwidth and allot $550 million for new prekindergarten and "3-K" centers for three-year-olds.
It would also pay for about 88 new school buildings or additions, though officials said it is a challenge to find room for construction in areas where seats are needed most. Some trailers now used for classrooms would be removed.


Four States to Vote on Redistricting Measures Ahead of 2020 Census
DENVER—This year is shaping up to be the busiest on record for redistricting ballot measures across the U.S.
Voters in four states will decide whether to adopt new methods for drawing political maps that proponents say would thwart partisan gerrymandering.
A major catalyst is the pending 2020 Census, which will be used to redraw U.S. House districts, and both major parties are jockeying for position ahead of it.
There are 43 states with more than one House district. In 37 states, congressional map drawing falls mainly to the legislatures, according to nonpartisan Ballotpedia.com. Four states use independent commissions to draw the lines, and two have political commissions.
Ballot measures in Colorado, Utah and Michigan would create commissions to draw maps for state offices and the U.S. House. A ballot item in Missouri aims to change the way state-level districts are drawn. These measures, plus a redistricting change Ohio voters approved in May, make 2018 the busiest year for such items, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.


American Soldier Killed by Afghan Security Forces Member
An American service member was killed and another wounded in Afghanistan on Saturday when a member of the government security forces opened fire at a base in the capital, Kabul, the U.S. military said.
The name of the dead soldier was not released, pending notification to his family, the U.S. military said in a statement. The wounded soldier was transferred for medical treatment to Bagram airfield, an American military base 35 miles north of Kabul, it said.
The assailant was shot dead by Afghan security forces as he fled, said Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Sayed Javid Ghafoor, adding that the attack occurred at an army training base in the capital.
The American fatality brought to at least nine the number of U.S. military personnel who have died this year in Afghanistan, according to a tally by iCasualties.org. Afghan security officials say fatalities among Afghan soldiers and police are currently running at more than 30 per day.
The motive for Saturday's attack wasn't clear, and no group immediately claimed of responsibility for it. The Taliban, however, lauded the assault, saying it was conducted by a "sensible" Afghan. They also urged other government forces to carry out similar assaults.


Voters Are Enthusiastic, Polarized, Engaged on the Issues
Reporters with the The Wall Street Journal spoke with voters Tuesday across the U.S., capturing a range of opinions that illustrated the nation's polarized political climate.
Turnout was huge, overwhelming election officials and yielding long lines at many polling sites. Immigration, health care and President Trump weighed heavily in races small and large.
Illinois
Carol Gebelt is an independent voter in Elgin, Ill. who doesn't much care for Mr. Trump's policies on immigration and health care. But when it came time to vote for a member of Congress, she stuck with the long-term Republican incumbent over a neophyte Democratic challenger.
Rep. Randy Hultgren, who first won his seat in the 2010 tea-party wave "seems reasonable to me, like he'd reach across the aisle and maybe buck Trump if necessary," said Ms. Gebelt. She wants to keep the 2010 Affordable Care Act and doesn't like the president's demeanor.
"I'm ambivalent about his tax reform," she said. "I think it's going to reset and all the benefits are going to go to the wealthy."


New York Eyes Ban of Flavored E-Cigarettes
The Cuomo administration is planning to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes as soon as next year—putting New York at the forefront of growing efforts around the country to rein in the products.
The state Department of Health posted regulations on Wednesday banning the sale or possession of flavored e-cigarettes, citing an "alarming increase of e-cigarette use among New York's youth" and a desire to "protect our youth from a lifetime addiction to nicotine."
A day after the regulations were published, the department rescinded them to allow additional time for a legal review, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. However, he said the administration would republish them soon, and the regulations could be adopted after a public comment period within 60 days of formal publication.
Mr. Cuomo is "very concerned about the rise in youth e-cigarette use, and this administration is looking to‎ do everything it can to curb this emerging public-health issue," the spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said.
New York would be the first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes, Mr. Azzopardi said. San Francisco residents voted in June to uphold a ban on all flavored tobacco products.


A Broward County Senate Steal?
Democrats have a hard time accepting electoral defeat. They've spent two years claiming with little evidence that Vladimir Putin elected Donald Trump. And now comes a vote-counting debacle in southern Florida that is at best gross incompetence, though don't rule out an attempt to steal GOP wins for Senate and Governor.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott is about 15,000 votes ahead of Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson for a seat in the Senate. That puts the race in range of an automatic recount under state law. But at 11:30 p.m. on election night, Mr. Scott led by 57,000 votes. The same trend is happening in the gubernatorial race that went for Republican Ron DeSantis over progressive Andrew Gillum, though neither race appeared to be heading for a recount on election night.
The spread has narrowed in the past couple days by what can only be described as a suspect process in notorious Broward County. Three days after Election Day the county wasn't finished reporting results from early voting, which ended on Sunday.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio was among the first to note the irregularities. Broward won't disclose how many ballots are left, and "isn't reporting hourly or regularly, but rather releasing thousands of additional votes, often in the overnight hours, that are chipping away at GOP leads," as Senator Rubio put it.
On Thursday a teacher in Broward found a container labeled "Provisional Ballot Box" in a storage area of an elementary school that had been a polling station. The Sun-Sentinel reported Friday that a Broward County election official said there were no ballots in the box, which would be more reassuring if country officials were more transparent.


Section 8 Recipients Get Help Moving to Better Neighborhoods
Shari Rivera lives in a three-bedroom apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens, with her two children and her niece. Last year, all of the cabinets in her kitchen fell off the wall, breaking her stove. She also has issues with roaches and mice.
As a participant in the federal housing program known as Section 8, though, it has been difficult for her to move to a different apartment, especially in a neighborhood with better schools.
"A lot of people don't want to take on Section 8 recipients," said Ms. Rivera, 32, who works for a party-planning company on Long Island. With rising rents, she has found herself priced out of many apartments. "How can you really compete?"
But Ms. Rivera is now one of 45 Section 8 participants selected through a lottery by New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development to take part in the agency's Mobility Counseling Program, in which she'll receive counseling and a larger voucher for finding an apartment. The lottery was open to Section 8 tenants who were already taking part in HPD's Family Self-Sufficiency program, which also offers support.
The HPD is funded through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Section 8 program has approximately 32,000 voucher holders, most of whom rent through private landlords.


The Coup That Wasn't
With votes still being counted, Democrats last week may have picked up as many as 40 seats in the House of Representatives. That would be their biggest gain since the Watergate year of 1974, and naturally progressives are expressing satisfaction. "Make No Mistake, the Midterm Elections Were a Democratic Victory," chortled the New Yorker. Apparently American democracy works—at least when Democrats win.
Yet it's worth recalling that this wasn't the view two years ago after Donald Trump's unexpected victory. Then the cry was all about a stolen election, Vladimir Putin's collusion with Mr. Trump, the need to rewrite the Constitution to banish the Electoral College, and the looming threat of an authoritarian coup. "If You're Not Scared About Fascism in the US, You Should Be," declared a headline in the New York Times as recently as mid-October this year.
So what happened to the coup? Did Mr. Trump call it off? It turns out the U.S. had a relatively normal midterm election in which the party not holding the White House gained a substantial number of seats. Conservatives aren't complaining about their losses, other than to worry with good cause that Democrats are violating the law as they count votes in counties they control in southern Florida. At least one judge has already ruled in the GOP's favor.
Meanwhile, the fair conclusion is that all of that talk about a fascist takeover was nothing more than partisan posturing intended to stigmatize the opposition and win an election.


U.S. Fears 'Premature' Return of Rohingya to Myanmar on Eve of Resettlement
The U.S. voiced concern about Myanmar's plans to repatriate Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh, saying conditions weren't yet conducive for their return and noting those who had remained in the country continued to face severe restrictions on their freedom of movement.
Myanmar has said it plans to receive hundreds of returning Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh beginning this week. It would be the first large-scale repatriations since Myanmar's military launched a brutal campaign against the ethnic minority in August last year.
On Sunday, Win Myat Aye, Myanmar's minister for social welfare, said as many as 300 Rohingya would return daily from Bangladesh starting about Nov. 15, until 2,251 refugees had returned in total. He said the Rohingya would be processed and checked for contagious diseases, before being sent to transit camps and given clothes and rations.
The push for repatriation comes as international pressure grows on Myanmar to resolve the refugee crisis. Neighboring Bangladesh has accused Myanmar of finding excuses to delay taking refugees back, and China and Singapore have called for progress on returning them. On Friday, a press release came out from China's Foreign Ministry applauding the repatriation steps—the broad details of which Myanmar outlined in October—saying: "This will create a good start for dealing with this complex historical issue and accumulate experience for the next step of repatriation."
While regional powers are eager for refugees to return, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it doesn't believe conditions in Myanmar are conducive for a safe return, and that Rohingya should be allowed to first see the conditions of their homes before deciding whether to resettle there permanently.


Ohio Officials Charge Family in 'Execution' of Another Family
Ohio officials arrested and charged four family members on Tuesday with planning and carrying out the brutal murders of eight people in another family, a case prosecutors said was the most complex and labor-intensive in the state's history.
Over 21⁄2 years, investigators followed more than 1,100 tips, conducted more than 550 interviews and served more than 200 subpoenas, court orders and warrants in the case, according to Attorney General Mike DeWine.
He said that George "Billy" Wagner III; his wife, Angela; and their two adult sons George Wagner IV and Edward "Jake" Wagner brutally shot to death seven members of the Rhoden family. The eighth victim was to marry into it.
Two other relatives of the Wagners were arrested for allegedly helping to cover up the crimes.
The killings were carried out in the early morning hours of April 22, 2016, at four homes in the small Appalachian town of Piketon, Ohio, about 70 miles south of Columbus.


You Didn't Get Amazon HQ2. Now What?
To the cities and states that lost the Amazon HQ2 sweepstakes:
Now that Amazon has announced it will put its new offices in Long Island City, N.Y., and Arlington, Va., ending perhaps the most overhyped—and for some of you, costliest—search process ever, you don't have much to celebrate. But you can use everything you've learned to attract new startups with no strings attached. The good news is that attracting startups won't require new tax incentives or infrastructure spending. What they want is a competitive level playing field. Here's how to offer it:
• Don't kill them with bureaucracy. If a business needs approvals and permits in each municipality in your state, create a statewide operating permit instead. If the requirements are consistent across localities—they usually are—it's easy enough to judge if a business meets them. Let them create jobs rather than fill out repetitive paperwork.
• Bring them into the procurement process. You're spending money on goods and services anyway. Why not make the process more accessible? It's often hard for vendors that aren't politically connected to compete for government contracts, or even to understand how. Explain the process, simplify it, make a point of alerting local tech companies to opportunities. Taxpayers would benefit, too.
• Figure out where you stand on new tech issues. Jurisdictions open to cryptocurrency, autonomous vehicles, drones and artificial intelligence can attract startups looking for testing grounds and a welcoming regulatory climate. Your own views or politics may make it impossible to be a leader in some of these areas, but odds are you can find common ground in at least one.


Florida's Election Procedures Under Multiple Legal Challenges
TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—A federal judge heard arguments on Wednesday over how Florida evaluates signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots, as an expanding legal battle over a U.S. Senate seat continues to work its way through the courts.
With an unofficial vote tally showing Republican Gov. Rick Scott leading incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by fewer than 13,000 votes, or 0.15 percentage points, Florida election procedures have once again become the center of American political attention. Unofficial results on Saturday showed three statewide races—the gubernatorial race, the agriculture commissioner race and the Senate race—within one half of 1 percentage point, triggering statewide machine recounts in each.
Local officials have raced to meet a Thursday deadline to complete a machine recount. Meanwhile, lawyers from both parties have filed lawsuits in state and federal courts challenging the recount procedures put in place after the 2000 presidential election, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court after breakdowns in Florida's election process.
On Wednesday, Democrats filed another lawsuit, while Mr. Scott prevailed in a challenge in Hillsborough County. The total number of lawsuits stemming from the election is beyond a dozen.
During the hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, lawyers sparred over the scope of the Democratic suit, which argues that the process for verifying signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots disenfranchises voters and is unconstitutional. Democrats are asking the judge to order the state to count all mail-in and provisional ballots, even if it cannot verify the signatures on them.


Bezos Invades Trump's Backyard
One of Donald Trump's favorite punching bags on a long shelf of punching bags is Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Mr. Trump says (tweets) that Amazon rips off the Post Office, should be investigated, blah, blah, blah. The animus likely has more to do with the impossibly wealthy Mr. Bezos's purchase in 2013 of the Washington Post at a price ($250 million) that would be like the rest of us buying a roadside antique. He has since let what seems like a battalion of Post writers spend their days tormenting Mr. Trump.
So when you look at the two places Amazon picked for its new semi-headquarters, an admittedly conspiratorial case could be made that after all the high anxiety of the selection process, Mr. Bezos picked Queens, N.Y., and Arlington, Va., as a big you-know-what to Donald Trump.
Queens is where Mr. Trump grew up and where his father Fred got his start in the business that became the Trump empire. As of this week, Mr. Bezos is the new king of Queens, wallowing in more New York tax subsidies than the Trump Organization ever dreamed of when building its gold-plated towers. Mr. Trump may never set foot in Queens again so long as the Amazon logo looms like an ISIS flag planted in his lost homeland.
Meanwhile, if you look out from the White House and down across the Potomac River, you can catch a glimpse of the great commercial white elephant called Crystal City in Arlington, Va. All of a sudden in President Trump's backyard, Mr. Bezos is the most famous, if not the biggest, real-estate developer in the Washington area.
We wonder if the prospective 25,000 Amazon workers coming to Long Island City in Queens are in on the joke. Across New York's political spectrum—though not including Mayor Bill de Blasio or Gov. Andrew Cuomo—the site selection is something that does not compute.


Democrat Jared Golden Declared Winner in Maine House Race
Democratic challenger Jared Golden beat Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin in a closely contested race for Maine's second congressional district, the secretary of state determined Thursday after running the state's unique ranked-choice tabulation process.
Mr. Golden's victory and another Democratic win—declared late Thursday by the Associated Press, by law professor Katie Porter over GOP Rep. Mimi Walters in California—gave Democrats a net pickup of 36 House seats with six GOP-held districts left outstanding.
Democrats are considered favorites in two of the remaining contests, while Republicans have an advantage in the other four. The final Maine vote was tallied amid a still-unresolved lawsuit from Mr. Poliquin, a two-term incumbent who sought to block the ranked-choice process.
Mr. Poliquin led by about 2,000 votes after an initial round of counting in the four-way race. But he didn't clear 50% support, which the ranked-choice process requires for a candidate to win outright. Two independents in the race collectively got about 8% of the vote.
That triggered another tabulation process, run on Thursday, to reallocate ballots from those independent candidates to whomever voters ranked as their backup choices. After that tally, Mr. Golden had 50.53% of the vote to 49.47% percent for Mr. Poliquin, Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said.


Yemeni Government, Houthi Rebels Agree to Peace Talks, U.N. Says
UNITED NATIONS—The United Nations' special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said Friday that warring factions there had committed to convening peace talks in Sweden shortly.
A date hasn't been set, but diplomats said they could begin this month.
Diplomatic talks have stalled for months while the conflict has escalated, and Friday's announcement delivered a glimmer of hope, U.N. officials and diplomats said.
At a Friday meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the Yemen conflict, which the U.N. says is the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis, Mr. Griffiths said both the Saudi-backed government and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have given him "firm reassurance" they will attend the talks. He said he aimed for the sides to discuss "substance" and agree on a path to deal that paves the way for a cease-fire and an inclusive government.
Mr. Griffiths said the parties were close to a confidence-building deal on a prisoner exchange. Saudi Arabia also agreed to medical evacuations from the rebel-held capital of San'a to neighboring Oman, he said.


A Tale of Two New Yorks
New York's Democratic kingpins Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio are getting hit from right, left and center for showering Amazon with some $3 billion in subsidies. The corporate welfare is even more outrageous when juxtaposed with New York City's dilapidated public housing that the Governor and mayor have long neglected.
This summer the Justice Department sued Nycha for sweeping its disrepair under a shabby rug. Nycha agreed to a court-appointed monitor to oversee $1.2 billion in repairs over the next five years. On Wednesday in a 52-page ruling, federal Judge William Pauley III, a Bill Clinton appointee, rejected the settlement as inadequate and perhaps unconstitutional.
According to the New York State Department of Public Health, 83% of Nycha's inspected units contained a hazardous condition. "Somewhat reminiscent of the biblical plagues of Egypt, these conditions include toxic lead paint, asthma-inducing mold, lack of heat, frequent elevator outages, and vermin infestations," the judge noted, adding that the authority "whitewashed these deficiencies for years."
While Mayor de Blasio agreed to spend an additional $1.2 billion to fix Nycha's 326 complexes that house 400,000 people, conditions are so awful that the authority estimates it needs $32 billion for repairs. "NYCHA's current capital needs would not be met until the year 2166," the judge wrote.
Judge Pauley added that a special monitor "would bring about an unwarranted—and as far as this Court is aware, unprecedented—judicial usurpation of responsibilities that Congress has expressly entrusted to" the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and "raises serious concerns implicating the separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power."


Saudi Arabia Accused of Torturing Women's-Rights Activists
Saudi security officers have tortured jailed women's-rights activists as part of a government campaign to squelch criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that began before last month's killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to people familiar with the situation.
At least eight of the 18 women's-rights activists detained by Saudi authorities this year have been tortured, including at least four who were subjected to electric shocks and lashings, according to two advisers to the Saudi royal family, activists and others with knowledge of the prisoners' treatment.
Asked to comment on the accusation, a Saudi official said: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's judiciary system does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture."
Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler, has sought to portray himself as a modernizer with plans to relax social strictures and attract foreign investment to remake its oil-dependent economy. In June, with great fanfare, the kingdom finally lifted the world's only ban on women driving.
At the same time, however, the kingdom has moved to silence perceived critics in waves of arrests targeting clerics, intellectuals and activists. In the anticorruption campaign that began last year, dozens of royal family members and prominent businessmen were rounded up and detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh; some of them were physically abused, according to people familiar with the matter.


South Korea Dissolves Group Central to Sex-Slaves Pact With Japan
SEOUL—In a sign of worsening relations between South Korea and Japan, Seoul said it would dissolve a foundation at the heart of a 2015 bilateral agreement that purportedly resolved a decades-old dispute over the treatment of women during Japan's wartime occupation of Korea.
Seoul's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said Wednesday it would formally close a Japanese-funded body created to compensate Korea's so-called comfort women, who were made to serve Japanese troops sexually.
The South Korean government called the decision a move to "help the victims recover their honor and dignity."
The wartime issue has strained ties between the two U.S. allies. Before the agreement, Japan had maintained that all issues relating to the compensation of wartime victims were resolved when it restored diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1965.
Nonetheless, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe struck a deal with his South Korean counterpart in 2015 aimed at "finally and irreversibly" drawing a line under the comfort women issue.


Will Facebook's Grownups Please Stand Up
Facebook executives have been struggling with the question of how to respond to fake news. Should the social-media giant remove misleading and vile content, opening itself to charges of censorship? Or is it better to take a laissez faire approach and let falsehoods spread unchecked, even if it invites criticism from politicians?
Now chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg find themselves at the center of a viral fake-news story. The New York Times last week published a story purporting that Facebook executives whitewashed Russia's use of their platform to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, among other lapses, and then employed crude tactics to deflect public furor.
The left's reaction has been as overblown as the story. "Embattled and in over his head, Mark Zuckerberg should—at least—step down as Facebook chairman," read a Washington Post column. A Times media columnist chimed in: "The Facebook Movie Told Us What We Needed to Know About Mark Zuckerberg." Hint: It isn't flattering.
Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal proclaimed the Times story another "chilling reminder that big tech can no longer be trusted." Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal and two other Democratic Senators demanded that the Justice Department investigate whether Facebook hid information and retaliated against critics.
Both Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have sidestepped responsibility for Facebook's alleged transgressions. "The reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you're not going to know everything that's going on," Mr. Zuckerberg said. Perhaps, but Facebook's root problem seems to be that its leaders refuse to assume responsibility or control over anything.


Passwords Aren't Enough. The Key to Online Security Is a Key.
NO MATTER how much alphanumeric complexity you add to passwords, chances are they're still not strong enough. Don't worry, mine are even weaker. Against all advice, I'm only willing to deliver the bare minimum asked of me when it comes to mixing numbers, letters and symbols. I stupidly use the same passwords for multiple sites, I rarely change them (unless forced to), and I hide them in very obvious places.
Any grade-school computer nerd could hack me on most platforms were it not for an extra layer of security: my YubiKey 5 (from $45, yubico.com). This encrypted device is a unique two-factor authentication system similar to what you're already using (right?) to bolster your online security.
If you're not, here are the basics: When logging into a site with two-factor from a new device, entering a password triggers the site to text you a randomly generated code you then type in to complete a login. It seems foolproof at first—no phone, no code. But anything digital is ultimately hackable and online criminals have already found crafty ways to intercept texts.
Here's what's different about the YubiKey and its competitor the Google Titan ($50, store.google.com): They must be in hand and physically connected to a device before you can access online accounts—either plugged into a USB port or pressed against a phone (which activates the key via Near Field Communication).
The keys, which fit on a ring next to ones for your house and car, automatically authenticate the sites you visit. Then each time you click "log in" and type your password, the key creates a one-time cryptographic code that pairs it with a site, completing the process. Without the key your passwords don't work, for you or, more importantly, anyone trying to hack you.


The Big Guns Fell Silent at the Right Time
Regarding Arthur Herman's "The Danger of Rushing Into Peace" (op-ed, Nov. 12): Toward the end of World War I, the allied forces were experiencing serious supply shortages. Gen. Charles Dawes, chief procurement officer for the American Expeditionary Forces, expressed his concerns to Gen. John Pershing's Chief of Staff, Gen. James Harbord. At the beginning of November 1918 Dawes was scrambling to find sufficient horses to replace those killed in battle. There were food and materiel shortages, as well.
In 1923, the year Pershing said that the armistice was signed too soon, he was exploring the possibility of running for president in 1924. I would write off his comment to political expediency.
Mr. Herman omits some crucial details: France and Britain were punitive in their actions toward Germany. They demanded monetary reparations for Germany causing the war. Postwar, the industrial world was plunged into a serious depression. Bernard Baruch, an observer at the Versailles Conference, said it best: "Given the political tenor of the times, if the negotiators had been forgiving toward Germany in the peace negotiations, the governments of England, France and Belgium would have been overthrown."
In this era of heightened nationalism, Baruch's observations deserve renewed consideration.

Nafta Suicide Note
President Trump can't leave good news alone, and right on time on his trip back from the G-20 in Argentina he decided to qualify his China success with a new threat to blow up Nafta.
"I will be formally terminating Nafta shortly," he told the press on Air Force One, referring to the current pact that is still in force until Congress approves the new deal with Mexico and Canada that Mr. Trump signed Friday. "And so Congress will have a choice of the [new] USMCA or pre-Nafta, which worked very well."
By "pre-Nafta" he means the continental trade rules in force before 1994. That would mean the immediate reimposition of tariffs and import restraints on a vast amount of trade. It would be an economic shock that could well send the economy into recession.
As a political matter it amounts to Mr. Trump holding a gun to his own re-election chances and daring Democrat Nancy Pelosi to let him pull the trigger. Mr. Trump seems to think that the chances of passing new Nafta improve if he presents Democrats with the ultimatum of voting for new Nafta or confronting the damage of terminating current Nafta.
That isn't how Democrats are likely to see it. They'll claim Mr. Trump negotiated a bad deal and demand changes knowing that if Nafta blows up and the economy suffers, a President always gets most of the blame. The media will naturally echo the Democratic view.


CIA Director to Brief Senators on Saudi Journalist's Death
WASHINGTON—Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel will brief Senate leaders Tuesday morning on what the spy agency knows about Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death at the hands of Saudi operatives, people familiar with the matter said.
Ms. Haspel's planned briefing follows criticism that the Trump administration received from several lawmakers last week after she failed to join an earlier briefing on Saudi policy conducted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
According to a highly classified CIA assessment, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmansent at least 11 messages to his closest adviser, who oversaw the team that killed Mr. Khashoggi, in the hours before and after the journalist's death on Oct. 2, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.
The Saudi government has denied Prince Mohammed had any role in the killing.
Ms. Haspel is expected to brief the leadership of the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Armed Services Committees, one of the people familiar with the matter said.


Man Who Drove Into Crowd  Convicted of First-Degree Murder
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.—A man who drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia was convicted Friday of first-degree murder for killing a woman in an attack that inflamed long-simmering racial and political tensions across the country.
A state jury rejected arguments that James Alex Fields Jr. acted in self-defense during a "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017. Jurors also convicted Fields of eight other charges, including aggravated malicious wounding and hit and run.
Fields, 21, drove to Virginia from his home in Maumee, Ohio, to support the white nationalists. As a large group of counterprotesters marched through Charlottesville singing and laughing, he stopped his car, backed up, then sped into the crowd, according to testimony from witnesses and video surveillance shown to jurors.
Prosecutors told the jury that Fields was angry after witnessing violent clashes between the two sides earlier in the day. The violence prompted police to shut down the rally before it even officially began.
Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist, was killed, and nearly three dozen others were injured. The trial featured emotional testimony from survivors who described devastating injuries and long, complicated recoveries.


Five Things on the France Protests
Antigovernment protests in France are rattling Emmanuel Macron's presidency. Here is a look at the protesters, known as gilets jaunes, and why they are so angry.
What is a gilet jaune?
Gilet jaune means "yellow vest." It is the fluorescent yellow vest that French drivers are required to have in their cars in case of a breakdown. Eric Drouet, a truck driver from the suburbs of Paris, created a Facebook event page calling for a nationwide protest on Nov. 17 against the government's proposal to raise taxes on fuel. Ghislain Coutard, a mechanic, uploaded a video suggesting that protesters wear their yellow breakdown vests.
What do the gilets jaunes want?
They want the government to cancel the proposed fuel tax increase. But the movement has expanded into a broader protest against Mr. Macron, whom many from the French hinterlands view as "president of the rich." Many want him to reverse a repeal of much of the wealth tax that he passed into law this year. Others want him and his government to step down.


Thank You, John Kelly
There are many unpleasant jobs in the world, but somebody has to do them. One is being Donald Trump's chief of staff, and so as he prepares to be liberated from White House bondage this month, John Kelly deserves the nation's gratitude.
Mr. Trump on Saturday announced the former general's departure "at the end of the year," after the typical death by a thousand White House whispers. "I appreciate his service very much," Mr. Trump said, and he certainly should.
The former homeland security secretary took the chief's job in summer 2017 when Mr. Trump needed someone to restore order after the Steve Bannon-Reince Priebus rivalry to nowhere. He tried to establish order in the President's schedule and meetings, to the extent that is possible, as well as a regular process for policy deliberations. Mr. Kelly did that well enough, and long enough, that the White House could negotiate tax reform.
But Mr. Trump hates discipline, especially self-discipline, and so he has chafed under Mr. Kelly's regimen. The wonder is that Mr. Kelly has lasted as long as he has considering the verbal abuse he has so often taken from his boss. The chief has also taken unwarranted abuse from the Beltway political class that wants to stigmatize anyone who works for Mr. Trump, as if it would be better if the White House were run solely by the Trump family.
A serious question is why anyone would take the job. Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, turned it down despite being the favorite of daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Perhaps the 36-year-old Mr. Ayers concluded that even having that title on his résumé isn't worth the grief he'd take externally and from the President. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney would be ideal, but he doesn't want it either.


Peace Officers Who Tried to Wrest Child From Mother Placed on Modified Duty
Two New York City peace officers were placed on modified duty Monday after they forced a woman holding a 1-year-old to the ground at a city agency's office and removed the boy from her arms with the help of New York Police Department officers, city officials said.
The two peace officers work for the city's Human Resources Administration, and at the time of the incident were assigned to a Brooklyn office that administers food stamps, according to city officials. They were placed on modified duty after cellphone video of the incident went viral on social media over the weekend, sparking demands for a probe into the officers' actions from politicians, lawyers and advocates.
The 23-year-old mother, Jazmine Headley, was arrested after the incident on Friday and charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child, obstructing governmental administration and trespassing, police said. The city's child welfare agency took her son and placed him with a relative, according to police officials. No one was injured in the incident, police officials said.
The cellphone video didn't capture the entire incident. It begins with Ms. Headley on the ground, cradling her child and shouting, "They're hurting my son," as the officers attempt to pull him away. A raucous crowd of bystanders surround the officers, and at one point, an NYPD officer stands up andpoints a stun-gun at onlookers, the video shows.
NYPD commissioner James O'Neill said police are reviewing video of the incident, which he described as "very disturbing." The NYPD's internal affairs bureau is investigating the incident, a police spokesman said.


Flynn's Lawyers Argue He Should Be Spared Jail Time
WASHINGTON—Two major figures targeted in the special counsel's investigation of Russian electoral interference appeared headed for very different sentences Tuesday.
Attorneys for former national security adviser Michael Flynn argued in a court filing that their client should receive up to a year of probation along with 200 hours of community service, in light of his cooperation with the government, his long service in the U.S. military and his lack of a criminal record. That builds on prosecutors' recommendation for a lenient sentence.
Earlier in the day, attorneys for President Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort suggested they might not challenge special counsel Robert Mueller's contrasting conclusion that Mr. Manafort lied to investigators and breached a plea agreement. Mr. Manafort faces eight to 10 years in prison based on a conviction in a federal trial in Virginia, and up to 10 years on additional charges to which he pleaded guilty in Washington, D.C.
Richard Westling, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, said in court it was possible that no hearing about the evidence of Mr. Manafort's alleged lies would be necessary—meaning Mr. Manafort could be sentenced without credit for any cooperation.
In Mr. Flynn's case, lawyers attached 50 letters of support attesting to his character and military service, mostly from current and retired military officers.


Federal Judge Deals New Blow to Affordable Care Act
WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Texas on Friday ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional now that Congress has eliminated a penalty for those who forgo health insurance, casting doubt on the embattled health law and coverage for millions of Americans.
U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, an appointee of President George W. Bush, ruled that the entire Obama-era health law is invalid, siding with the claims of 20 Republican states that brought a lawsuit seeking to strike down the ACA.
Republicans eliminated the ACA's penalty for not having coverage last year, although the measure doesn't go into effect until 2019. Mandatory health coverage was a linchpin of the original law, intending to draw healthier people into the insurance pool to help offset the costs of sicker enrollees. The Supreme Court has upheld the ACA as constitutional based on Congress's taxing power.
The Trump administration, which has long sought to repeal the ACA, applauded Friday's ruling.
"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!" President Trump wrote on Twitter. In a statement, the White House elaborated, saying, "Once again, the President calls on Congress to replace Obamacare and act to protect people with preexisting conditions and provide Americans with quality affordable healthcare."


The Yellow Jackets Are Right About Green Policies
Seek out the most basic cause of the French riots and you'll come to a bizarre answer: carbon dioxide. More specifically, the demonization by political activists of that vital element of the earth's atmosphere.
French President Emmanuel Macron stirred popular rage by trying to raise the gasoline tax by about 25 cents a gallon. He argued that higher taxes would reduce fuel use and hence emissions of CO2, helping France meet the lower emissions goals to which it is pledged as a signatory to the United Nations' Paris Agreement to fight climate change.
Mr. Macron has learned the hard way that voters don't see climate change as a threat demanding personal sacrifices. The rebellion is global. Green measures that caused energy prices to soar damaged Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's 2017 election. Green energy plans were repudiated by voters in Australia and helped cause a political upheaval in the Canadian province of Ontario.
Voters in Washington state and Arizona rejected November ballot measures aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. The Journal's William McGurnreported last week that 200 prominent civil-rights leaders have filed suit against the California Air Resources Board. Green policies, they argue, are saddling the poor with higher living costs.
The voter rebellion is on solid scientific ground. The global expenditure to curb CO2 emissions, estimated in 2009 by Danish scientist Bjorn Lomborg to cost $180 billion a year, stems from the U.N.-engineered 1997 Kyoto Protocol. That treaty was always about politics, not science. In recent years global weather stations have measured ups and downs, but data from U.S. and British monitoring agencies showed that global temperatures in 2017 were roughly what they were 20 years earlier.


A Shutdown Over Something
The country is yawning as Washington wrangles over another possible government shutdown this weekend, and no wonder. The fight is over a difference of merely $3.4 billion in funding for border security. If Donald Trump really wants a political fight worth having, and a chance to retrieve his public standing, he'd go much bigger and offer legalization for the Dreamers in return for his money.
At this late stage such a trade isn't likely. Republicans who lost in November want to get out of town, and Democrats figure they'll be in a stronger position in January when they run the House. We are left with one of those shutdown spectacles in which the rhetoric is so bitter because the stakes are so small.
The White House wants $5 billion for a border wall as the price of a deal. President Trump appeared to welcome a shutdown in a meeting with Democratic leaders last week. "So I will take the mantle," he said. "I'll be the one to shut it down."
But then on Tuesday the White House said it could find "other ways" to win the $5 billion and appeared to step off the shutdown ledge. The thinking is that perhaps some of the funding already in law could be rejiggered, though Democrats are sure to howl if the White House proceeds.
Another possibility is to pass a continuing resolution through the new year and delay the fight until the next Congress convenes. The gambit is that the politics will be cleaner for Republicans when they can blame Democrats who will then be running the House. Yet President Trump is even less likely to prevail on border funding next year without making even larger concessions.


Democrats Criticize Barr Over Mueller Memo; Nomination Proceeds
WASHINGTON—A newly disclosed memo by William Barr criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller's legal approach rippled through Washington Thursday, angering Democrats but providing little indication that Mr. Barr's confirmation as attorney general would be imperiled.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor that Mr. Barr's memo, especially his contention that acts taken by President Trump under his presidential authority couldn't amount to obstruction of justice, should rule him out as attorney general.
"The fact that he holds these deeply misguided views and chose to launch them in an unprovoked written attack on the special counsel unquestionably disqualifies Mr. Barr from serving as attorney general again," Mr. Schumer said.
Noting that Mr. Trump hasn't yet formally nominated Mr. Barr, who also served as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, Mr. Schumer said the president "must immediately reconsider and find another nominee who is free of conflicts and will carry out the duties of the office impartially."
White House officials gave no indication they were reconsidering the nomination, however. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, said he had been aware that Mr. Barr had written a memo about the Mueller investigation and was familiar with its arguments before The Wall Street Journal reported on it Wednesday.


Ex-Senate Staffer Accused of Lying to FBI Gets Jail Time
WASHINGTON—A federal judge sentenced a former Senate staffer who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with journalists to two months in jail and a fine of $7,500, in a case that has drawn scrutiny from those concerned about press freedom.
James Wolfe, the former security chief for the Senate Intelligence Committee, was charged with lying about his contacts with several reporters, including a New York Times reporter with whom he had a romantic relationship. In rendering her sentence, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson rejected a government push for a tougher sentence above the typical guidelines.
"Making false statements to a government agent is a federal crime precisely because of the risk that such lies will thwart legitimate law enforcement inquiries, making it impossible for the truth to be known and for justice to be served," said Judge Brown Jackson in imposing the sentence. "There is no question you have committed a serious crime."
Prosecutors had sought a 24-month prison term, which would have been an unusually long sentence. Sentencing guidelines suggest zero to six months in jail for a defendant with no prior criminal history who is charged with making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The judge said Mr. Wolfe's service as a top Senate intelligence staffer with access to classified information made her more inclined to impose jail time.


The Syria Fallout
The implications of Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria will play out over many months, but a portent was apparent Wednesday. While Mr. Trump was defending his Syria pullout during his visit with U.S. troops in Iraq, Russia was condemning Israel's defensive air strikes in Syria. This is only some of what will fill the vacuum left by America's departure.
Israel rarely acknowledges its military actions, but for months it has been hitting targets inside Syria to deter and degrade the buildup of Iranian proxy military forces. Russia accused Israel of "provocative" actions, and Israel later said that its aerial defense system had been activated in response to an antiaircraft missile launched from Syria.
Mr. Trump said with his typical bravado that Israel can defend itself well enough without the U.S. "And I spoke with Bibi [Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu]. I told Bibi. And, you know, we give Israel $4.5 billion a year. And they're doing very well defending themselves, if you take a look," Mr. Trump told reporters at the Al Asad Air Base in Iraq.
But Israel's sorties are getting more dangerous as Russia builds up its regional air defenses in Syria. The Institute for the Study of War reports that Russia has deployed at least three new S-300 surface-to-air missile battalions in Syria since October, which will significantly complicate the missions for Israeli pilots and perhaps even for standoff weapons.
Vladimir Putin isn't eager for a war that costs Russian lives, but his willingness to take down an Israeli aircraft may grow as the U.S. abandons the theater. The Russian strongman may also want to test Mr. Trump's vow, which the U.S. President repeated Wednesday, that the U.S. will defend Israel in a fight. Iran will not stop arming its proxies and expanding its own presence in Syria, so some kind of Iran-Israel-Russia conflict is no small risk in 2019.


Trump Mulls Slower Syria Pullout, Senator Says
WASHINGTON—President Trump is re-evaluating a rapid pullout of U.S. troops from Syria but remains committed to pursuing the withdrawal he announced earlier this month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday after a White House meeting.
"I think we're slowing things down in a smart way," Mr. Graham (R., S.C.) said. "But the goal has always been the same: To be able to leave Syria, to make sure ISIS never comes back, our partners are taken care of and Iran's contained."
The president's decision earlier this month marked an abrupt shift in U.S. Middle East policy and helped prompt the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis amid broad concerns in Washington a withdrawal could squander gains made by U.S. allied forces and allow Islamic State militants to regain a foothold in the country.
Critics have warned the exit of more than 2,000 U.S. forces could also bolster Iran's power and fuel worries about U.S. commitment among other allies around the world.
"All of this strengthens Iran at a time when Trump claims to have a policy of pressuring Iran," said Jeffrey Feltman, a former senior State Department official and United Nations undersecretary general for political affairs.


Court Officials Blast Mayor de Blasio for Delays on Judges
Mayor Bill de Blasio has failed to fill nine judicial seats that were vacated on Jan. 1, leading to expected backlogs and delays in New York's justice system, state court officials say.
"Today we have 12% fewer judges sitting on the criminal court than we did on Monday, the last day of the year," said Lawrence Marks, the court system's chief administrative judge. "The fact that they aren't on the bench today will have a significant adverse impact on the criminal court's operations."
On Dec. 12, Chief Judge Janet DiFiore wrote a letter to Mr. de Blasio, asking him to fill four family court and 11 interim civil court judgeships. Interim civil court judges are usually moved to criminal court because of a greater need for judges there.
In the letter, the chief judge said filling judgeships would help reduce the number of criminal cases involving people detained at the jail complex on Rikers Island, an effort Mr. de Blasio has supported.
A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said choosing qualified judges is essential to maintaining the integrity of the justice system.


Costs Convert Hospitals Into One-Stop Shops
I have worked in hospital administration for the past 40 years, almost 30 years now as the CEO of small community hospitals. There is no doubt that services provided in physician offices or free-standing outpatient centers are often less expensive than the same services provided in a hospital setting ("Hospitals Push Doctors To Keep Referrals In-House," page one, Dec. 28).
Hospitals are open and staffed with registered nurses, imaging techs, laboratory techs, pharmacists, housekeepers, plant-services staff, registrars, nutrition services staff, etc.—24-hours a day, seven days a week. There's an Emergency Department for those who need it, a birth center for mothers-to-be, surgeons and anesthesia providers available at the drop of a hat, and hospitalist physicians available to take care of inpatients. This is all fixed overhead that is figured into the cost of services. So the next time someone wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain, or falls off a ladder on a Sunday afternoon, or goes into labor at 9 o'clock in the evening, or doubles over with lower-flank pain on Christmas Day, perhaps they should knock on the door of a physician's office or outpatient center and see how far they get.
Of course, if enough business goes to nonhospital options there won't be sufficient hospital revenue to cover all of the overhead inherent in operating a hospital, and hospitals will close, as many already have. Then where will people go for care?

Key Numbers Behind Immigration
Cracking down on illegal immigration was a central piece of President Donald Trump's campaign for the White House and is now at the center of his fight with Congress over funding for a wall on the border with Mexico.
Republicans and Democrats have different views on the extent of the problem associated with undocumented immigrants and how to address the issue. Mr. Trump says it is an important contributor to crime and a big cost to the government. Democrats say he overstates the problem.
Here is a look at some key numbers behind U.S. immigration:
STEADY NUMBERS: The exact number of people living in the U.S. illegally is unknown. As of 2015 the Department of Homeland Security estimated there were about 12 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, compared with 10.5 million in 2005 and 11.6 million in 2010. The Pew Research Center recently released a report estimating that the population of unauthorized immigrants had declined as of 2016 to about 10.7 million people and was down over the past decade. Taken together, a rise of undocumented workers in the U.S. appears to have slowed after large increases in the 2000s.
SUBSTANTIAL SHARE: About 45.1 million people in the U.S. are foreign born, according to Pew's estimates. Undocumented immigrants make up almost a quarter of that total, and naturalized citizens make up nearly one half.


Protecting Tenants and Expanding Ferry Service on Mayor's Plate This Year
In Mayor Bill de Blasio's sixth year in office, New York City residents should expect to see more safeguards against bad landlords, stronger workplace protection and improved transportation.
Mr. de Blasio highlighted these priorities Thursday during his State of the City speech before a crowd at Symphony Space on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
"Do you see your life getting better this year? Or are you just holding on?" he asked. "I'm here to tell you, you're not alone."
Mr. de Blasio—a Democrat whose 2013 campaign focused on a "tale of two cities"—has spent his two terms as mayor determined to ease the disparity between the rich and poor throughout New York City.
"You haven't been paid what you deserve. You haven't been given the time you deserve. You're not living the life you deserve," the mayor told the cheering audience. "There's plenty of money in the city. It's just in the wrong hands. You deserve a city that gives you the share of prosperity that you have earned."


Obama-Era War on Executive Power Foreshadowed Trump's Wall Fight
Angered by what they saw as presidential overreach, lawmakers said the president was acting like a king.
The president at the time was Democrat Barack Obama, and the lawmakers warning of an imperial presidency were Republicans, who protested Mr. Obama's moves to implement the Affordable Care Act and extend protections for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
The Obama-era fights over executive power foreshadowed in some ways the current standoff over President Trump's insistence on building a wall on the southern border. Mr. Trump is considering whether to invoke national-emergency powers to bypass Congress to build a wall he says is crucial to U.S. border security.
Democrats warn that such a move would amount to an abuse of power—echoing arguments made by GOP lawmakers during Mr. Obama's presidency—and an illegal encroachment on Congress's power to set federal spending.
As with Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama vowed he wouldn't let his agenda stall. He said he would use his "pen" and "phone" to make headway where possible, refusing to wait for a consensus between his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress to take shape.


China Sentences Canadian to Death for Drug Conviction
A Chinese court ordered the death penalty for a Canadian national in the latest example of how deeply ensnared Canada has become in a battle between the U.S. and Beijing over the detention of a prominent Huawei Technologies Co. executive.
Canadian Robert Schellenberg was convicted of taking part in methamphetamine smuggling and sentenced to death in a one-day proceeding just days after the court announced he would be retried. Two months earlier, the same court sentenced Mr. Schellenberg to 15 years in prison for the same offense, but this time around prosecutors charged him with being a key figure, not just an accessory, in an international drug-smuggling ring.
The 36-year-old, who was arrested more than four years ago, has maintained his innocence throughout. On Monday he stood impassively when the judge delivered the sentence.
Western legal experts have called the trial an attempt by China to pressure Canada over the arrest, at U.S. request, of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Co., the world's biggest telecommunications networking-gear maker and an influential Chinese national champion.
"We are a bit like the meat in a sandwich right now," said Peter MacKay, Canada's former foreign minister and now a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie. He added his main concern is Chinese officials using the detention and sentencing of Canadian citizens to warn other nations about aligning with the U.S. in its cold-war approach against Beijing. "They wouldn't dream of doing this [to] the U.S.," he said.


Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to Launch Exploratory Committee for 2020 Presidential Bid
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Tuesday that she is forming an exploratory committee for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, seeking to mobilize women opposed to President Trump.
Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview on CBS's "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" that she would file the required paperwork on Tuesday evening but that she was launching a full campaign.
"As a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own," she said.
Her announcement, part of an 11-minute interview, was interrupted by cheers several times. Ms. Gillibrand said she would bring people together and find common ground to tackle problems like the current federal-government shutdown. She pointed to her past efforts to secure health-care funding for first responders of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The 52-year-old senator from New York has positioned herself as a leading voice of Democratic dissent during the Trump presidency, opposing Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees. She has also carved out a role as a prominent voice in the movement against sexual harassment and assault.


For Sanity's Sake, Delete Your Account
One Saturday morning last fall, I sat down at my desk and deleted my Twitter account.
I did it for a variety of reasons. Privacy, for one: The thought of people unknown to me prowling around my account made me uneasy. It was also a distraction. Most Twitter regulars will confess to wasting hours following the idiotic spats and tirades for which the medium has become famous.
That leads me to the primary reason for deleting my account: I am not God.
Twitter—and I gather this applies to a lesser degree to other social media—gives one an awareness, or at least the impression of an awareness, of what hundreds or even thousands of people are thinking at the moment. If you follow more than a small number of accounts, you're likely to find, in addition to some fine wit and the occasional useful link, an immense quantity of material that's by turns obtuse, absurd, mean and mendacious. Yet such tweets will arouse your ire or curiosity. You'll look further into the exchanges in which they occur, and after a short time you will have considered a vast array of vicious, defamatory and inane utterances.
Complaints that too many people are publishing their ill-formed thoughts are not new. In 1802 the Scottish critic Francis Jeffrey groused in the Edinburgh Review that "hairdressers and valets write amatory verses; coffeehouse waiters publish political pamphlets; and shoemakers and tailors astonish the world with plans for reforming the constitution." That sounds hopelessly elitist in our egalitarian era, but Twitter is the ludicrous conclusion of the propensity Jeffrey lamented.


New Jersey Lawmakers Push to Know Who Hired Official Accused of Sexual Assault
After days of testimony from the highest-ranking members of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's administration, lawmakers still don't know who hired a state employee accused of sexual assault.
Lawmakers have formed a special committee to investigate how Mr. Murphy's transition team and administration handled the hiring of Al Alvarez, a former outreach director for the governor's campaign who some transition officials and Mr. Murphy's former chief of staff knew had been accused of sexual assault.
Mr. Alvarez has denied the allegation.
A spokesman for Mr. Murphy has said Mr. Alvarez was hired as chief of staff at the New Jersey Schools Development Authority after transition officials learned prosecutors had investigated and declined to charge him.
Mr. Murphy's chief counsel, Matt Platkin, testified before the legislative committee Friday that he didn't hire Mr. Alvarez and doesn't know who did. Lawmakers, who heard the same answer from the governor's former chief of staff and the executive director of his transition team at previous hearings, expressed frustration that they haven't been able to determine who offered Mr. Alvarez his state job.


U.S. and North Korean Spies Have Held Secret Talks for a Decade
WASHINGTON—U.S. intelligence officials have met with North Korean counterparts secretly for a decade, a covert channel that allowed communications during tense times, aided in the release of detainees and helped pave the way for President Trump's historic summit last year with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The secret channel between the Central Intelligence Agency and spies from America's bitter adversary included two missions to Pyongyang in 2012 during the Obama administration by Michael Morell, then deputy CIA director, and at least one by his successor, Avril Haines, say current and former U.S. officials.
The channel appears to have gone dormant late in the Obama administration. Mike Pompeo re-energized it while CIA director, sending an agency officer to meet with North Korean counterparts in Singapore in August 2017.
By early 2018, a whirlwind of secret and public talks were underway, which brought together Messrs. Trump and Kim in a pomp-filled Singapore meeting in June. The intelligence channel played a role. The two sides are preparing for a second summit in late February.
A few details of the contacts have been previously reported. This article represents the most comprehensive description of how it worked.


Israel Hits Iranian Targets in Syria After Golan Heights Attack
TEL AVIV—Israel said Monday it struck several Iranian targets in Syria in response to a missile attack, sending what appeared to be an increasingly forceful public message to Tehran to stay away from its borders as U.S. troops prepare to leave Syria.
Israel's military said it hit Iranian targets including munition storage sites, a military training camp and a site at the Damascus International Airport in overnight strikes. Israel also struck several Syrian aerial-defense batteries after Syria fired dozens of missiles at its jets, the military added.
The strikes came after Israel's military accused Iran's Quds Force, an elite arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, of firing a missile at the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on Sunday.
Israel's attack adds to the hundreds of strikes in Syria carried out by its military in a yearslong operation to foil Iranian military entrenchment on its northern border. But it marked only the third time Israeli strikes have targeted Syria in response to a direct attack by Iran.
Israel's military generally avoids commenting on its frequent individual strikes in Syria to maintain ambiguity and avoid retaliation. But an apparent change of tack in recent weeks has seen Israel going public following strikes, despite concerns that it could prompt the Iranians to respond and potentially escalate the exchange of fire into a wider regional war.


Catholics Against Columbus
Father John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, announced Sunday that the school would cover a dozen murals depicting the life of Christopher Columbus. "The murals' depiction of Columbus as beneficent explorer and friend of the native peoples hides from view the darker side of this story," he asserted in a letter. While this decision may give the university a brief respite from its critics, it will never be enough. Columbus may be the momentary object of hatred, but the real target is the Catholic faith itself.
What exactly is the dark side of the Columbus story? The facts do not add up to rash charges of genocide and murder made by his critics. If anything, they reveal a man who was not perfect but still ahead of his time.
Brown University anthropologist Carol Delaney has defended the explorer's reputation extensively, noting that his interactions with Native Americans tended to be "benign." And Bartolome de las Casas, the most outspoken defender of the Native Americans in the colonial period, also supported the explorer's intentions and motivations.
The colonial experience was often traumatic and certainly had its faults. But as a Peruvian-American of color, I still believe there is much to celebrate in how the Americas have changed in the past 500 years. As a Catholic, I particularly value Columbus for bringing the first of many missionaries who showed millions of people the path to salvation.
Any reasonable analysis also must acknowledge that the indigenous world was not perfect either. Take one example.


NYC to Pay $3.3 Million to Kalief Browder's Family
New York City will pay $3.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of the teenager who spent three years at the Rikers Island jail complex after being accused of stealing a backpack, becoming a symbol of dysfunction in the criminal-justice system.
In 2010, 16-year-old Kalief Browder, originally from the Bronx, was arrested and held at Rikers on $3,000 bail. He spent time in solitary confinement and returned to court dozens of times. In 2013, the charges were dismissed. After his release, Mr. Browder died by suicide in 2015 at the age of 22.
"Kalief Browder's story helped inspire numerous reforms to the justice system to prevent this tragedy from ever happening again, including an end to punitive segregation for young people on Rikers Island," a spokesman for the New York City Law Department said on Thursday. "We hope that this settlement and our continuing reforms help bring some measure of closure to the Browder family."
The city didn't acknowledge wrongdoing in the settlement.
"This was a fair and reasonable settlement," said lawyer Sanford Rubenstein, who represents Mr. Browder's estate.


U.S. to Start Returning Some Asylum Seekers to Mexico
The Trump administration on Friday will start returning some asylum-seeking migrants to Mexico to wait for their U.S. immigration court hearings, the first step in implementing a new border policy announced last month.
A U.S. official said under the program, starting at the San Diego border, selected migrants will be turned back after being processed by American immigration authorities and given a notice to appear in a U.S. immigration court in about a month, U.S. officials said.
A Trump administration official said the U.S. will determine how many migrants are sent back to Mexico each day, but didn't indicate how many that would be.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the plan in response to the large number of migrants, mostly from Central America, crossing the border illegally or asking for asylum at ports of entry. Ms. Nielsen said in congressional testimony that change was needed because current policy allows asylum applicants to "disappear into the United States."
In December, the Mexican government said it would allow Central American migrants back into the country while they wait for U.S. hearings. They will get humanitarian visas to stay and work. Officials there also said they have had multiple meetings with their American counterparts to discuss timing, technical details and logistics to ensure that asylum seekers have access to their lawyers.


Roger Stone Was Longtime Associate of Donald Trump
Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser who was indicted Thursday by special counsel Robert Mueller, has had a relationship with the president for four decades.
While Mr. Stone never had an official White House role, the political strategist played a key part in getting Paul Manafort—his former business partner—to run Mr. Trump's campaign for a time in 2016, according to people on the campaign and Mr. Manafort himself. Mr. Manafort was charged and convicted of several crimes relating to his work for pro-Russian politicians and is awaiting sentencing.
Mr. Stone, 66 years old, has long been known as a colorful and controversial political consultant, working for Republicans like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. He has said in numerous interviews that he became fascinated with politics as a teenager after being given a copy of Barry Goldwater's "The Conscience of a Conservative."
He, along with Mr. Manafort, was part of the consulting firm Black, Manafort & Stone, which was particularly powerful in the 1980s.
Mr. Stone was introduced to Mr. Trump by hard-driving attorney Roy Cohn in 1979 when Mr. Stone was in New York organizing for Mr. Reagan's presidential campaign, he has said publicly. Two years later, the Trump Organization hired a lobbying firm run by Messrs. Stone and Manafort.


The State of the Union Is Missing
Donald Trump's signature, which he enjoys displaying after signing bills and executive orders, is unusually big, sharp and jagged. It's like the lines a seismograph makes during an earthquake, or what a polygraph shows when you're telling a whopper. Lately it has looked bigger and sharper.
He's in a crisis he summoned. There is now a plan to reopen the government for three weeks. His numbers are down. His foes, delighted at his struggle, refused to help him get out—even as they claimed concern that employees were going without pay and air-traffic controllers are calling in sick, even when the longer the shutdown, the likelier something really bad would happen.
The State of the Union address was to be sacrificed. It is fair that the president would not give the address—and that the House speaker not leave Washington, even to visit troops—during a shutdown in which others, not they, suffered. But it would have been much better if both sides had met and issued a statement: "We acknowledge that a shutdown is always the result of failure, and while it continues the president and the Congress will forgo benefits of office. We will continue to talk and attempt to end the impasse. As soon as we do, this important address will take place."
They couldn't say that because they weren't talking. Which was amazing in itself, and a scandal.
Nancy Pelosi's original excuse for disinviting Mr. Trump, security concerns, was lame and disingenuous, and being obviously those things it was also aggressive.


President Trump, After Shutdown Ends, Says 'We Will Build the Wall'
WASHINGTON—President Trump showed no sign this weekend he was prepared to give up his insistence on a border wall, as negotiators prepare to begin talks aimed at keeping the government open and resolving a bitter impasse over funding for the wall.
On the day after Mr. Trump and congressional leaders reached a deal reopening the government for three weeks, Mr. Trump tweeted, "We will build the Wall!"
He also suggested underlying partisan divisions that set off the monthlong government shutdown remain in place, writing on Twitter, "both parties very dug in."
On Sunday, his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Sunday news shows the president was willing to do "whatever it takes to secure the border," including shut down the government once more or declare a national emergency. "The president takes this deadly seriously. It's his No. 1 priority to secure the border," Mr. Mulvaney told CBS's "Face the Nation."
Under the deal struck Friday, House and Senate negotiators appointed by congressional leadership will use the next three weeks to see if they can settle the dispute over funding for a wall along the Mexican border.


Tulsi Gabbard's 2020 Contribution
The left is ascendant in the Democratic Party, as likely presidential candidates outdo each other with promises of free college, single-payer health care and a guaranteed income. Yet the party's direction on foreign policy is still up for grabs, which makes Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential bid more interesting.
Elizabeth Warren says "it's time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans," whatever that means. Kamala Harris vows not to conduct international relations by tweet, while Kirsten Gillibrand promises the opposite of whatever President Trump does.
Ms. Gabbard is different in making foreign policy a focus. "There is one main issue that is central to the rest and that is the issue of war and peace," said the four-term Hawaii Congresswoman, 37, in a recent CNN appearance announcing her candidacy. Her vision for a more limited American role in the world will be the campaign's central theme.
First elected to the Hawaii House at 21, Ms. Gabbard steadily climbed the island's political ranks. Along the way she joined the Hawaii Army National Guard and served in Iraq. She says her time in the military has made her more hesitant to support U.S. involvement abroad.
She is best, or worst, known for bringing the Aloha spirit to Damascus and meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in January 2017. She says she doesn't regret the meeting and has since defended the Assad regime. This is part of a consistent skepticism regarding U.S. military missions from Africa to Afghanistan.


China's Huawei Reckoning
The twin U.S. indictments of Huawei on Monday provide enough detail to make a compelling case for criminal acts. Huawei says it's innocent, and the telecom giant deserves its day in court, but the message is that China and its companies can no longer violate global norms with impunity.
Justice claims in one indictment that Huawei employees in the U.S. stole T-Mobile technology at the direction of superiors in China. In 2006 T-Mobile designed a robotic phone-testing system known as "tappy." T-Mobile then provided Huawei access to a high-security lab where the robot tested phones.
The indictment says Huawei employees abused their security clearances by taking pictures and admitting an unauthorized Chinese engineer. One Huawei employee removed a robotic arm in his laptop case but claimed he had merely made a "mistake" when caught. Huawei conducted an internal investigation and fired two employees it said had "acted on their own." But the charges say Huawei paid bonuses to workers for stealing trade secrets.
The other indictment says Huawei and CFO Meng Wanzhou used a shell scheme to conceal its business in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions for a decade. Justice says Huawei operated the Hong Kong telecom company Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary and misrepresented this relationship to the government and banks. This let Huawei clear transactions from its Iranian business in U.S. dollars and euros.
In 2007 Huawei's founder—Ms. Meng's father Ren Zhengfei—told the FBI Huawei did not violate U.S. sanctions. Huawei also denied a 2012 Reuters report that it used Skycom to dodge sanctions. After one bank terminated its Huawei relationship in 2017 because of "risk concerns," Huawei turned to another unspecified bank that it also allegedly deceived.


Judicial Scramble Drill
Our editorial Wednesday on White House negotiations with California Democrats over judicial nominees struck a nerve, and it's good to know we get results. The Trump Team appears to have backed off this bad idea, though not without treating one nominee as collateral damage.
On Wednesday evening the White House announced more judicial selections, including two of the three Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals nominees who were originally nominated last year but went missing from a renominations list earlier in January. The rushed release was damage control after our reporting that the White House counsel's office had withheld the names while negotiating over nominees with Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris.
Kenneth Lee and Daniel Collins have now been renominated for seats on the Ninth Circuit, and both are lawyers in private practice who have considerable government experience. The White House also nominated Daniel Bress, an appellate lawyer and former clerk for Antonin Scalia, to the Ninth Circuit.
Mr. Bress is certainly qualified, but he replaces Patrick Bumatay, who was nominated to the Ninth Circuit last year but this time was nominated for the federal district court. District judges typically handle trials, while circuit judges handle appeals and constitutional claims. Appellate judges are also the bench from which Supreme Court nominees are often selected.
The 40-year-old gay Filipino-American was the prime target of Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Harris, and this White House concession makes no sense. Mr. Bumatay may now be years away from a circuit-court seat if he ever wins one. Worse, the White House has lent credence to the specious Democratic claims that he isn't qualified.


Trump to Begin Releasing Fiscal 2020 Budget Plan on March 11
The White House is expected to begin releasing the president's fiscal year 2020 budget proposal on March 11, about a month later than usual due to the partial government shutdown.
Administration officials have told lawmakers the proposal will be unveiled in two parts. The president's budget message, top priorities, and summary tables will come March 11. The remaining materials, including proposed spending cuts, detailed budgets for each agency. and the analytic perspectives document, including the economic assumptions underlying the plan, will be released the following week, according to a Senate GOP aide.
A senior Office of Management and Budget official said Monday the agency is aiming to release the president's fiscal blueprint in mid-March.
The White House is technically required to submit a budget proposal to Congress by the first Monday in February, but the 35-day shutdown delayed the scheduled release.
About two-thirds of OMB staffers were furloughed from Dec. 22 to Jan. 25, according to the agency's contingency plan.


'El Chapo' Jury Ends Third Day of Deliberations Without Verdict
NEW YORK—Jurors in the trial of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera will continue deliberations Thursday over whether the infamous Mexican drug lord is guilty of 10 criminal counts related to drug trafficking, after ending a third day of deliberations with no verdict.
The 12-person jury in Brooklyn federal court faces the daunting task of digesting evidence from a three-month trial, during which the government called more than 50 witnesses and showed hundreds of exhibits. To reach a decision, the jurors must go through an eight-page verdict sheet and answer 53 questions.
So far, the jury has deliberated for 17 hours.
The first count alone, which charges Mr. Guzmán with leading a "continuing criminal enterprise" as head of the Sinaloa cartel, lists 27 violations. To convict him of that charge, the jurors must agree unanimously that the government proved Mr. Guzmán committed at least three of the violations, which include conspiracy to murder and distribution of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
That count also requires jurors to answer whether the government proved the cartel received $10 million or more during at least one 12-month period from the distribution of cocaine.


Cyberattack Rattles Australian Parliament
CANBERRA, Australia—Australia's parliament was hit by a cyberattack that authorities believe came from overseas, the latest in a string of infiltrations into government computer systems globally.
Australian authorities said the attack targeted computer systems in both houses of parliament early Friday, but was intercepted early and there was no breach of confidential information. They said it did not appear to be an attempt to influence coming national elections due by May.
"We have no evidence that this is an attempt to influence the outcome of parliamentary processes or to disrupt or influence electoral or political processes," Speaker of the House Tony Smith and Senate President Scott Ryan said in a joint statement.
Still, more than 5,000 political and administrative staff in Canberra had been advised to change computer passwords and access codes.
The source of the latest Australian attack is not yet known, but the country's main cyber defense agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, said "necessary steps are being taken to mitigate the compromise and minimize any harm".


After Synagogue Shooting, Pittsburgh Gun-Control Bills Meet Resistance
PITTSBURGH—A little more than three months after 11 people were shot to death while worshiping at a synagogue here, city leaders and residents are battling over proposed gun restrictions.
The legislation put forward by the city's mayor and City Council members would ban within city limits semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks and certain types of ammunition, as well as expand the ability of courts to seize guns from people determined to be a threat to family members or law enforcement.
The measures have drawn a swift backlash in a liberal-leaning city ringed by more conservative suburbs where there is a long tradition of gun ownership. Opponents have called for the mayor's impeachment or arrest, and the local district attorney has said that instituting the gun restrictions would violate state law.
"Arrest me. Sue me. Impeach me," Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Jan. 28. "I was elected to protect my constituents and that is exactly what I will do."


Deadly Bombing Targets Indian Security Personnel in Kashmir
A bombing attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group against a convoy carrying Indian security personnel killed dozens in the troubled region of Kashmir.
Thursday's strike, for which the armed Pakistani militant group Jaish e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, was the region's deadliest in recent memory and immediately ignited calls within India for retaliation.
Neighboring countries and the U.S. have long accused Pakistan's military and spy agency of nurturing jihadists as proxy warriors for use in Afghanistan and India, but attacks claimed by militant groups in Pakistan have become rare in recent years. Instead, Kashmir—for decades the site of a bloody partisan divide between Hindus and Muslim separatists—has suffered growing violence from among its local population that India has struggled to contain.
Those attacks lead to rising casualties within Kashmir last year. But cross-border tensions had remained in check as infiltrations by groups based in Pakistan have tailed off.
After Thursday's attack, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency meeting of his cabinet committee on security Friday morning, an Indian official said.


Israeli Summit of European Powers Collapses Amid Holocaust Dispute
Israeli plans to hold a summit aimed at improving relations with Eastern European countries fell apart Monday after acrimonious exchanges over who was to blame for the murder of Jews during World War II.
Poland first pulled out of the meeting, planned to take place in Jerusalem on Tuesday, after a series of comments by Jewish leaders regarding Poland's alleged participation in the Holocaust.
In solidarity with Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic said they would hold bilateral meetings with Israeli leaders instead of attending the summit. Israel said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would meet separately with the countries' prime ministers ahead of a group lunch.
Mr. Netanyahu has aimed to cultivate stronger ties with these right-leaning nations in a bid to drive a wedge between them and the rest of the European Union, which his government considers to be harshly critical of Israel in international forums. The dispute comes ahead of Israeli elections in April: Mr. Netanyahu is drawing on his ties to world leaders to pitch himself as being in another league and the best face for Israel on the world stage.
Plans for the summit unraveled Monday after Israel's top diplomat said Poles had "suckled anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk," in the latest clash between two governments largely aligned except on where to apportion blame for the wartime murder of Jews.


Everyday Catholics Can Fight Sex Abuse
More than 15 years after Americans learned of gross abuse of children by Catholic priests, this week the Vatican hosts its first-ever summit on the "protection of minors." For four days bishops from across the world will hear victims' testimony and recommit to eradicating abuse. Pope Francis deserves praise for convening this gathering, but American Catholics should heed his warning last month to "deflate the expectations."
This week's summit will cover well-worn ground for the U.S., where reform already has dramatically reduced priestly predation. And there's no indication it will deal with two related crises that directly bear on the protection of the innocent: unaccountable bishops, and priests who break their vows of celibacy. These problems also demand the Vatican's full attention.
American Catholics have been grappling with how to prevent abuse since the exposure of grave crimes against minors by priests in the Archdiocese of Boston. It led the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2002 to adopt the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People." The Dallas Charter, as it's known, instituted a zero-tolerance policy for proven abuser priests and mandated immediate removal from ministry of priests credibly accused of abuse. It also ordered the formation of local review boards, run primarily by lay Catholics, to create long-overdue policies and investigate accusations.
The results have been heartening. In 2018 the U.S. bishops' latest annual report found 373 credible allegations of abuse. Only four took place in 2017, the most recent year with available data. Nearly 90% occurred or began before 2000, shortly before the Dallas Charter was enacted, with nearly 75% occurring between 1960 and 1990. While there will always be more to do to safeguard children, the church is on the path to accountability and healing.
Even the recent Pennsylvania grand-jury report and the revelations about former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick support this conclusion, as both primarily deal with decades-old abuses. Yet these disturbing revelations still highlight other issues.


Mexican Meth Fuels an American Crisis
The opioid crisis grabs the headlines, but what about the meth crisis? Methamphetamine, produced by Mexican cartels and smuggled over the southwestern border, killed 10,333 Americans in 2017, more than in any previous year. Worse, preliminary statistics show an increase to more than 12,000 in the year ending last July. President Trump says there's a "crisis" at the border, and he's right—its result is the meth-overdose epidemic.
Meth first made its mark on American society in the mid-1980s. But a spike in meth deaths beginning in 2003 prodded Congress to pass the 2005 Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This restricted the sale of cough medicines that meth makers used to cook up the drug. Deaths dropped and Congress stopped paying attention.
Then something alarming happened. Meth-overdose deaths exploded between 2008 and 2017. Over that period, the annual death rate from meth overdoses per 100,000 people rose from 0.4 to 3.2, an eight-fold increase. This rise coincided with a new wave of meth on America's streets. Methamphetamine was the single most common drug reported by police forensic scientists to the Drug Enforcement Administration's database of laboratory samples in 2017—more than marijuana, cocaine or opioids.
The new meth isn't homegrown. Thanks to DEA crackdowns—shuttering backyard labs and controlling Sudafed—domestic production has virtually evaporated. But that left a hole in the market, which Mexican drug-trafficking organizations moved in to fill. Today the methamphetamine on American streets is synthesized in Mexican labs using ingredients made in Mexico or sourced from China, taking advantage of struggling foreign regulators. This new drug—typically 90% methamphetamine—is less diluted and more potent and sells at rock-bottom prices. Old trailer-made meth has been replaced with industrial-grade product.
The cartels' dominance of the meth trade is why U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has each year since 2007 reported a huge increase in the volume of methamphetamine it interdicts at America's southwestern border. It seized 67,292 pounds in the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, nearly five times the haul from 2012. Even still, eight DEA field divisions reported increases in meth's availability in 2017. From Portland, Ore., to Louisville, Ky., to Philadelphia, meth is back.


Venezuelan Official Breaks With Maduro
The former chief of Venezuela's military intelligence broke with President Nicolás Maduro on Thursday and pledged his support for U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó amid a deepening political crisis in the South American nation.
Hugo Carvajal, a retired general and current congressman for the ruling Socialist Party, called for authorities to allow into Venezuela the humanitarian aid that the U.S. is stockpiling on the Colombian border.
"People of Venezuela, we find ourselves in the worst humanitarian crisis of our modern history," he said reading a statement before directing his words to Mr. Maduro. "It's been more than enough, Nicolás. Assume your responsibility."
Mr. Carvajal, who spent more than three decades in Venezuela's military, also had a sobering message for active troops, many of whom have been appearing in propaganda videos meant to rile up nationalist sentiment against what the Maduro regime says is an imminent U.S. invasion.
"Today we do not have the technical capacity to confront any enemy," he said. "He who says otherwise lies."


Kim Jong Un Heads to Hanoi for Meeting With Trump
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un left Pyongyang by train for Hanoi, North Korean state media reported Sunday morning, in its first official acknowledgment of the closely watched two-day summit meeting with President Trump.
The meeting in the Vietnamese capital, which follows a historic first summit between the two leaders in Singapore in June last year, is set to take place on Feb. 27 and 28. President Trump announced the plans on Twitter three weeks ago, and Vietnam's Foreign Ministry has officially confirmed the meeting.
But North Korea had refrained from making any mention of the coming summit through official channels until the last minute, as it has done ahead of other planned summit meetings, including with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.
The summit is aimed at dealing with North Korea's growing nuclear program and "advancing the cause of peace," Mr. Trump said in announcing the meeting earlier this month.
Mr. Pompeo said in an interview on Thursday that "complete denuclearization" remained the goal of the Trump administration.


Bernie Sanders Says He Plans to Release 10 Years of Tax Returns
WASHINGTON—Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Monday he intends to release 10 years of his tax returns at the start of his second presidential campaign, joining Democrats who have sought to contrast themselves from President Trump, who has refused to release his own tax records.
The independent senator, asked during a CNN town hall meeting if he would release a decade of his tax returns, said he would make the records public "sooner than later." He added, "Our tax returns will bore you to death."
Democrats running in the 2020 primaries have aimed to present transparency in their campaigns. Mr. Trump's refusal to disclose his tax records breaks with presidential tradition dating back four decades.
During his 2016 campaign fight with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders released a seven-page federal tax return from 2014. But he declined to release earlier tax records, while Mrs. Clinton released several years of her own.
Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have posted at least a decade of their tax returns online, while Kamala Harris of California said this past weekend that she intends to do so.


Syria's Assad Visits Tehran, Looking to Cement Ties
TEHRAN, Iran—Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sought to boost economic ties with Iran as he met the country's leaders on Monday, his first public visit to a regional ally that has helped him reassert control over Syria after eight years of war.
Iran "stood beside us [in the war] and it is necessary to congratulate you and all the Iranians for the current success," Mr. Assad told Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to Iranian state media.
Mr. Assad said his country and Iran should "constantly develop their economic relations" to help them take on those who are plotting against them, Iranian state media added. The two countries have often talked about boosting economic ties, but haven't signed any significant deals yet.
Mr. Khamenei, in turn, was quoted by the state media as calling Mr. Assad "the hero of the Arab world."
Mr. Assad's unannounced visit to Tehran comes as Russia and Iran have consolidated their influence in Syria through their support for Mr. Assad, without which he likely wouldn't have prevailed. His government, backed by Moscow and Tehran, has nearly defeated all its armed opposition after a bloody war that started in 2011. Also, the Islamic State terror group is close to being ousted from its last sliver of Syrian territory—after which the U.S. plans to drawdown its troops in the country, The U.S. move would create a void for Russia and Iran to fill, analysts say.


Patients Face Monthslong Waits for New York Specialists
New York City Health  Hospitals chief Mitchell Katz told members of the City Council during testimony Monday that wait times to see medical specialists at some of the city's public hospitals can stretch to months, depending on where a person seeks care and incremental staffing changes.
A patient at North Central Bronx, for example, might wait as long as three months to see a cardiologist, said Dr. Katz, the president and chief executive of the city's 11 public hospitals and 70 clinics. Patients of Jacobi, also in the Bronx, might have to wait three months to see an endocrinologist, cardiologist, renal specialist, neurologist or ophthalmologist, Dr. Katz said. Meanwhile, Harlem Hospital in Manhattan has the shortest wait times to see a cardiologist and gastroenterologist, but it would take three months to see a podiatrist, he said.
The question of wait times comes as the city seeks to deliver health care to some 600,000 uninsured and undocumented residents. Last month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, announced the NYC Care program which will promote care offered at the city's hospitals and encourage those eligible to sign up for insurance. Already, the city's hospitals take all patients, regardless of ability to pay, and offer a sliding-scale fee system. The city will invest some $100 million annually when NYC Care is at full scale.
The wait time for a primary-care visit at one of the city's facilities is within one to two weeks, said Dr. Katz, and those needing a specialist urgently are accommodated. Generally, he said, wait times to see a specialist can be greatly affected by a small staffing change like a doctor retiring.
"I am trying and making some progress to get Health  Hospitals to see itself as a system, to help one another," Dr. Katz said.


House Votes to Block Trump's Border-Emergency Declaration
WASHINGTON—The House voted to block the White House from redirecting federal funds toward building a border wall, and the Senate inched closer to doing the same, raising the specter of President Trump exercising his veto power for the first time.
As newly empowered House Democrats moved to assert congressional authority over government spending, there appeared to be nearly enough Republican support for the measure to clear the Senate in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump has already said he would veto the measure should Congress send it to his desk.
The House measure was the first of its kind to pass since lawmakers in 1976 wrote the National Emergencies Act, which allows Congress to terminate an emergency declaration. The law also limits an emergency to 180 days unless the president renews it. The measure cleared by a vote of 245-182, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats.
Mr. Trump recently declared a national emergency over the southern border after Congress passed a spending bill that appropriates $1.38 billion for 55 miles of barriers—significantly less than the $5.7 billion he had demanded. Dissatisfied with the lower figure, the president said he would pull together $6.7 billion from the military and other sources, saying it was needed to properly secure the border.
Democrats said their effort to block the president was about upholding the checks and balances in the Constitution, which bestows upon Congress the power of the purse.


A Day of Jarring Images for Trump
Americans got a choice on Wednesday: They could view President Trump as contender for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with North Korea, or see him as a criminal and con man because of how he was portrayed by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen.
Those were the jarring, head-spinning television images that emerged from what will surely be remembered as one of the most memorable days of the Trump presidency. And if ever there was a day that encapsulated the promise, peril and extraordinary nature of that presidency, Wednesday was it.
By day's end, it was less clear whether, beyond the drama and theater, the ground had actually shifted in a substantive way. Nothing concrete has yet happened on North Korea. Meanwhile, legal analysts immediately began debating whether Mr. Cohen opened significant new fronts of vulnerability for the president, or merely added vivid details to a narrative already generally known.
Moreover, views of Mr. Trump are so divided, and so entrenched, that even such a momentous day may leave Americans only more deeply locked in to what they already believe about the 45th president—and increasingly sputtering with rage at those on the other side of the divide.
Of course, Americans have some experience holding conflicting images of their presidents. They watched President Bill Clinton be impeached while he was overseeing a period of sustained peace and prosperity. They saw President Richard Nixon move from a historic opening up of China to a Watergate crisis that led to his resignation.


I Inherited Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Regarding Susan Pinker's "Mind & Matter: Inheriting the Trauma of Genocide" (Review, Feb. 23), in which she reviews a recent study that found PTSD symptoms in the adult children of surviving Tutsis of the Rwanda genocide: The devastating intergenerational effects of trauma are seen in the children of refugees as well. My colleagues Drs. Sheila Gahagan and Wael Al-Delaimy and I conducted a similar study in which we interviewed 200 Somali refugee mothers and their 10-year-old children currently living in San Diego. The mothers had experienced significant trauma and some torture in refugee camps or in the Somali civil war. Interestingly, most of the mothers gave birth to their children in the U.S., thus the children weren't directly exposed to trauma.
Our findings showed that the extent of the mothers' trauma and torture strongly related to their current PTSD symptoms, which in turn contributed to their children's depression, bullying victimization and racist experiences. Sadly, these findings are relevant to the millions of displaced persons around the world and indicate that the effects of trauma on refugees can linger across time and across generations.

New York State Budget Talks Stall Over Revenue Projections
New York state budget negotiations broke down over the weekend as Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democrats in the state legislature continued to disagree over revenue projections for the coming fiscal year.
Talks between the two sides, which have until April 1 to agree on a budget, began on Thursday but stalled on Saturday.
Under state law, the impasse means Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli will issue a revenue forecast on or before March 5. Legislators consistently push for higher numbers than the governor, but the current situation represents the first time in Mr. Cuomo's three-term gubernatorial tenure that he and the Legislature have been unable to reach consensus.
"It means they are getting off to a testy start, but it doesn't mean they are doomed and they are not going to be able to do a budget," said E.J. McMahon, research director at the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank.
The disagreement marks another point of tension between Mr. Cuomo and the legislature, which for the first time in his tenure is fully controlled by his fellow Democrats. Mr. Cuomo has been trading barbs with Senate Democrats over the collapse of a deal to develop a headquarters campus for Amazon.com Inc. in Queens.


Hillary Clinton Says, 'I'm Not Running' for President
Hillary Clinton for the first time Monday ruled out seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
Mrs. Clinton, who lost the 2016 general election to President Trump and the 2008 nomination to Barack Obama, told a local cable TV news station in the New York suburbs that "I'm not running."
Aides to Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign have long said she would not make a third attempt at the White House in 2020, but the former secretary of state had yet to speak publicly about her plans.
Mrs. Clinton, who has met or spoken with several of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, said she plans to "keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe."
Asked if she would declaratively rule out ever seeking elected office again, Mrs. Clinton demurred but didn't rule it out.


Bail for Ghosn—but Justice?
Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan CEO arrested at a Tokyo airport last November, is finally being released on $9 million in bail. It's a step forward for the Japanese legal proceeding—such as it is—even if it comes with onerous terms. Twice Mr. Ghosn's bail requests were denied, until a new lawyer proposed he would live under surveillance and with restrictions on his phone and computer use.
Perhaps the Japanese are beginning to see how this harsh treatment of an automotive icon is making their justice system look almost Third World. Mr. Ghosn's family has denounced the "medieval rules" and "deplorable" conditions, while preparing an appeal to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Mr. Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said last month the case "could signal that Japan is unpredictable and excessive in what it allows authorities to do to individuals, in terms of conducting business."
No kidding. Mr. Ghosn denies wrongdoing. "I am innocent," he said Tuesday, "and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations." Prosecutors have had months to interrogate him without a lawyer present, yet they haven't offered a convincing case.
Mr. Ghosn has been accused of failing to report deferred compensation; of having Nissan cover some collateral for foreign-exchange contracts he used because he was paid in yen; and of having Nissan pay a Saudi businessman who aided him personally. Mr. Ghosn countered that there was never any contract for undisclosed compensation; that the collateral was a temporary fix during the 2008-09 crash that caused Nissan no losses; and that the Saudi provided "critical services that substantially benefited Nissan."
If there's evidence to the contrary, prosecutors haven't provided it. The case looks on the public evidence like the kind of disagreement about a CEO's actions that could have been handled in the board room rather than a courtroom. The actual trial against Mr. Ghosn isn't expected to start for many more months. But at least he won't have to wait from a jail cell.


House Democrats Say Shush
House Democrats are voting as early as Friday on H.R. 1, a campaign-finance reform bill that they allege is an attempt to rinse politics of "dark money." But even their pals on the left aren't buying it.
One of the more searing indictments of the bill is a March 1 letter from the American Civil Liberties Union, normally found these days supporting the left. In a 13-page letter, the ACLU said that some of H.R. 1's provisions "unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations." Such measures, the group said, would silence "necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day." Indeed.
Provisions in the bill would require groups that, say, run ads to disclose the names of donors above $10,000. That would force political groups, the ACLU notes, "to make a choice: their speech or their donors. Whichever they choose, the First Amendment loses."
The bill covers groups that run ads about, say, climate change that refer to candidates but don't endorse them. What this means, the ACLU says, is "advocacy groups speaking about the issues that matter most to them, like abortion or gun rights, may see no alternative but to steer far clear of the regulated zone to avoid penalties" or "mandatory disclosure of their private associations."


Iranian Court Sentences U.S. Navy Veteran, Human-Rights Lawyer
DUBAI—An Iranian court has sentenced a U.S. Navy veteran for an unspecified crime, according to Iranian state-linked media, in a move that threatens to further strain relations between Washington and Tehran.
Michael White was detained last year in the northeastern city of Mashhad after an individual accused him of wrongdoing, while authorities also were investigating possible security-related charges against him, an Iranian prosecutor said in January.
On Monday, the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted the prosecutor, Gholamali Sadeghi, as saying Mr. White had been sentenced but the report didn't give any details of the verdict.
A court in Tehran, meanwhile, sentenced Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human-rights lawyer who has become an international symbol of resistance in Iran, to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes, her husband wrote on Facebook Monday. State-linked media reported a different verdict, quoting the judge in the case as saying Ms. Sotoudeh had been sentenced to seven years in prison, five for conspiring against the state and two for insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Ms. Sotoudeh's husband, Reza Khandan, insisted that his wife had received the longer reported sentence, though he didn't know the exact charges, according to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, which spoke to him.


Solitary Confinement Helps Control Prison Gangs
Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, former head of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel, will likely spend the rest of his life in a supermaximum security prison. He will be among the 60,000, or more than 4% of inmates in U.S. state and federal prisons, living in solitary confinement—physically and socially isolated for 23 hours a day in a cell smaller than a parking space. That's torture, according to the United Nations, and in 2015 President Obama called on the Justice Department to review federal solitary-confinement practices and offer guidance to reduce its use. Many reformers would like to abolish it altogether.
There are good reasons to support reform. But solitary confinement remains necessary to counter the threat of gangs. Prison officials endorse the practice as one of the few effective ways of stopping violence and keeping prisons safe.
A study of ours published last week in Justice Quarterly shows that gang affiliation is a major driver of placement in solitary confinement. Based on a survey completed by 39 of 50 state correctional agencies, we found that gang-affiliated prisoners constitute only about 15% of U.S. prisoners, but 36% of inmates in solitary confinement. Gang affiliates were three times as likely to be housed in solitary confinement as unaffiliated prisoners and were overrepresented in 90% of state prison systems.
There are generally three reasons to place inmates in solitary confinement, and gang members check all the boxes. First, they earn their placement for disciplinary reasons. Gang members are involved in more misconduct behind bars, including violence. Second, many gang affiliates, such as dropouts or snitches, need solitary confinement for their protection. They're targets for violence. Third, some inmates are administratively segregated—placed in solitary for managerial purposes—because of threats they pose to the prison system, such as escape risk, violence, participation in uprisings or, more controversially, gang affiliation.
Gang affiliates were overrepresented across all three categories of reasons, but the disparity was greatest for administrative segregation. Correctional employees have great discretion to classify an inmate as a gang affiliate, and placement in solitary confinement can be indeterminate or last until the threat wanes. But if gang affiliation is deemed the source of the threat, when does it end? There are few ways to leave a gang in prison.


U.S. Swipes at International Court Over Afghanistan Investigations
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is imposing visa restrictions against International Criminal Court officials, citing investigations by the ICC into the activities of Americans and their allies in Afghanistan.
Mr. Pompeo said the visa restrictions had begun, and he declined to provide details on the number or identities of the individuals affected. He warned that the U.S. is prepared to take additional steps, including economic sanctions, in an effort to head off what he called improper investigations.
The announcement comes in response to moves by the ICC, kicked off in late 2017, to solicit information on alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan since May 2003. The ICC said it has received about 700 submissions from alleged victims, and it is working to determine whether to authorize an investigation.
The ICC, which began in The Hague in 2002, is intended as a court of last resort for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, when national justice systems can't or won't take action. American elected officials from both parties have long been wary of the court because of the potential to prosecute American officials for military operations.
John Bolton, national security adviser to President Trump, has long opposed the ICC, and before assuming his post urged Mr. Trump to "strangle the ICC in its cradle."


The Establishment Clause and That Other Wall
Regarding your editorial "A Supreme Court Cross-Roads" (Feb. 27): The court's messy jurisprudence on the Establishment Clause derives from errant court rulings that separation of church and state means that a "wall" blocks incursions by either side.
While Thomas Jefferson's oft-cited reply to an apprehensive clergyman assured him that the Establishment Clause would prohibit government interference in religious matters, Jefferson's letter never contemplated the converse that the exercise of religion would be walled off from the public square; after all, would that not dilute the Establishment Clause's absolute prohibition against government interference in the people's free exercise of religion? Jefferson, himself, attended public worship services in the Capitol.
It's a matter of competing equities. Preventing public-school students from huddling in prayer on the football field or barring a cross, nativity creche, Star of David or star and crescent from public property only gains the complainant a paper win but deprives devoted people of their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion. Allowing such acts of religious expression hurts no one to any comparable degree.
Let's hope a fifth justice steps up in the Bladensburg cross case to clarify that the government should not be prohibiting private acts of religious expression on public property unless a constitutional amendment to the Establishment Clause says so.

Warren's Populist Puritanism
H.L. Mencken defined puritanism as the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. Remember that amid the deluge of demands to break up Facebook , Google, Amazon and Apple .
Columbia law professor Tim Wu insists that bigness is bad. "We've let Facebook have their ride, they've made their money and they've been very successful," he told the American Enterprise Institute last month. "I just think there's a very good track record in tech of trying to put pressure on the monopolist and break things up a little bit." Basically, Facebook got big and now it's someone else's turn.
Wannabe president Elizabeth Warren wants to "break up Big Tech" and split the companies into heavily regulated "platform utilities." She told crowds at South by Southwest: "The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits. Boohoo." The politics of envy is the populist playbook.
Yet the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits two specific types of business practices: anticompetitive agreements, or collusion, and conduct to limit competition. Judges define these violations by a consumer-welfare standard, assessing whether consumers are harmed by a lack of competition. "Innocent monopolies" earned by merit are not illegal. Antitrust says nothing about bigness.
No matter. The calls are getting louder for Facebook to split off Instagram and WhatsApp. Same for Amazon carving out Whole Foods. Or Google divesting its 2007 acquisition DoubleClick. Or spinning out the App Store from Apple, as Spotify is seeking in the European Union. There's little sign of consumer harm in any of these cases.


NYC's Elite Public High Schools Admit A New Class—With Little Change in Diversity
As in recent years, black and Latino students received less than 11% of the offers Monday to New York City's eight specialized high schools, which admit applicants through a single exam.
At Stuyvesant High School, for example, only seven black students and 33 Latino students got one of its 895 offers.
Although notices went out, it is still too early to know what the exact racial makeup of these sought-after schools will be next fall.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who wants to scrap the admissions test to make the schools more diverse, doesn't have the power to do so for Stuyvesant, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School, where admissions are governed by state law.
What he has done instead is announce a major expansion of the program called Discovery, which offers seats at specialized high schools and free tutoring to talented, disadvantaged students who miss the test-score cutoff.


After Mass Detentions, China Razes Muslim Communities to Build a Loyal City
URUMQI, China—In this old Silk Road city in western China, a state security campaign involving the detention of vast numbers of people has moved to its next stage: demolishing their neighborhoods and purging their culture.
Two years after authorities began rounding up Urumqi's mostly Muslim ethnic Uighur residents, many of the anchors of Uighur life and identity are being uprooted. Empty mosques remain, while the shantytown homes that surrounded them have been replaced by glass towers and retail strips like many found across China.
Food stalls that sold fresh nang, the circular flatbread that is to Uighur society what baguettes are to the French, are gone. The young men that once baked the nang (or nan in Uighur) have disappeared, as have many of their customers. Uighur-language books are missing from store shelves in a city, the capital of China's Xinjiang region, that has long been a center of the global Uighur community.
Supplanting the Turkic culture that long defined large parts of Urumqi is a sanitized version catering to Chinese tourists. On a recent morning in the Erdaoqiao neighborhood, the once-bustling heart of Uighur Urumqi, nang ovens were nowhere to be seen—but souvenir shops sold nang-shaped pocket mirrors, nang bottle openers and circular throw pillows with covers printed to look like nang.


Houses of Worship Upgrade Security After Shootings
So far this year, 18 faith-based groups have reached out to security consultant Steve Padin for help developing safety plans, more than twice as many as in all of 2018.
Simon Osamoh, whose Minnesota company also handles security consulting for houses of worship, said more than 150 religious organizations attended his group's annual conference last year. In 2016, fewer than 50 showed up.
Last week's massacre at two mosques in New Zealand is the latest in a raft of mass shootings to hit churches, synagogues and mosques, prompting places intended to serve as havens from bloodshed to seek professional security services. Religious leaders now want guidance on safety measures, like fortifying entrances and exits, spotting troubled congregants and deciding whether to hire their own armed security teams, experts say.
"In the last decade specifically, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of churches who are intentional about security," said Carl Chinn, who runs a new network of faith-based security personnel that he says numbers more than 200.
According to FBI data, attacks on houses of worship accounted for 4% of 250 active-shooter incidents in the U.S. from 2000 through 2017. But the 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas; last year's synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh; and last week's attack at two Christchurch mosques that left 50 dead are spurring religious groups to change fundamentally how they approach safety issues.


Concern Grows for U.S. Citizens Detained in Venezuela
The State Department is demanding that a dozen U.S. citizens and permanent residents being held in detention in Venezuela be granted access to proper nutrition and medical care, and be afforded fair judicial treatment.
Concern has grown for the detainees in the days since the Trump administration closed the U.S. embassy in Caracas and withdrew all American personnel.
"The United States is gravely concerned about the welfare and safety of all U.S. persons detained in Venezuela, and by reports of Venezuelan prison officials preventing attorneys and families of detained U.S. citizens from delivering food and denying routine communication," State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement Friday.
Twelve U.S. citizens or permanent U.S. residents are being held by the Maduro regime, including six who were executives at Citgo and who have been in custody since November 2017 as part of an alleged anticorruption probe. At the time, Mr. Maduro claimed the U.S. embassy had petitioned for their release—an assertion not confirmed by U.S. officials.
"These people were born in Venezuela," Mr. Maduro said then. "They're Venezuelans and they'll be tried for corruption, for being thieves and traitors against the fatherland."


Political Dynamics Raise Risk for Israel-Hamas Clash
TEL AVIV—Exchanges of fire between Israel and Hamas resumed late Tuesday, breaking a fragile calm, as political pressures on both sides threatened to spark a wider conflict.
Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, faces tensions at home over a deteriorating economy that triggered recent protests. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is campaigning in a tough re-election battle, aware that a tough stance on security is paramount for voters.
Israel and Hamas have been marching closer to war over the past year, with several rounds of violent flare-ups followed by frail cease-fires. The latest incident happened Monday when a rocket launched from Gaza injured seven people in a Tel Aviv suburb, prompting Israel to pound Hamas targets for hours.
More exchanges followed even after Hamas declared an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire Monday night—unacknowledged by Israel. The clashes died down Tuesday morning but flared up again at night after militants launched rockets towards Israel and Israel said it then struck Gaza military targets.
Earlier on Tuesday Mr. Netanyahu had ordered additional troops to the country's south. The army chief of staff approved calling up additional reserve soldiers.


Barr Plans Mid-April Release of Redacted Mueller Report
WASHINGTON—The Justice Department expects to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference by mid-April, the attorney general told Congress, in the face of continued pressure from Democrats demanding to see the full document.
In a letter to congressional leaders Friday, William Barr provided an update on the efforts by the Justice Department to make public as much of the report outlining the special counsel's findings as possible. The 22-month investigation probed Russian activity during the 2016 election, as well as whether President Trump obstructed justice.
In his letter, Mr. Barr said the report was nearly 400 pages, excluding tables and appendices, and that officials had no plans to submit the report to the White House for review of any confidential or privileged information. He said material related to intelligence sources, ongoing investigations, grand-jury matters and the privacy of individuals not charged with crimes will be redacted from any version made public.
"I share your desire to ensure that Congress and the public have the opportunity to read the special counsel's report. We are preparing the report for release, making the redactions that are required," Mr. Barr told leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. "Our progress is such that I anticipate we will be in a position to release the report by mid-April, if not sooner," he added.
The letter marked an attempt to defuse a brewing fight on Capitol Hill over access to the report, which was submitted under wraps to the attorney general last week. Mr. Barr released a four-page summary of the top-line findings of Mr. Mueller's investigation but hasn't shared any of the details.


A Rule to Speed Up Confirmations
The U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to confirm or reject presidential nominees, and the Senate's pace in the Trump era is slower than it has ever been. The reason is deliberate and persistent Democratic obstruction and abuse of Senate rules, so three cheers for Republicans for advancing a modest change in those rules to let President Trump form a government before his first term ends.
Senate Republicans are moving this week to limit Senate debate on most executive and judicial nominees to two hours. The current "cloture" process triggers 30 hours of debate on the floor, even after candidates have been vetted and passed out of committee. Democrats have hit the cloture button regardless of their views on the nominee because it absorbs floor time and slows the Senate to a stall.
Democrats forced some 128 cloture votes in Mr. Trump's first two years, including for the first time in history on 42 executive-branch jobs. These included five cabinet secretaries, six deputy secretaries, six ambassadors (including to the strategically crucial state of Luxembourg), and a slew of lower-level positions that weren't at all controversial.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has offered the example of President Trump's nominee—drum roll, please—to the Federal Railroad Administration. Ronald Batory had worked in the railroad industry for 45 years and attracted no opposition, yet the Senate blocked his nomination for more than 200 days. Another classic: A cloture vote on a nominee to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Who knew seasonal adjustment could be so controversial?
Republicans have been discussing how to speed up this grind. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma has put forth a proposal that would trim debate time to two hours for most nominees and district court judges. The exceptions would be cabinet secretaries and appellate court and Supreme Court nominees, all of whom would be kept at the 30-hour standard.


Trudeau Expels Lawmakers From Party Caucus Over SNC-Lavalin Uproar
OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled from the Liberal Party caucus two former ministers, among them a former attorney general, who had criticized his administration for allegedly trying to interfere politically in a criminal prosecution.
The decision Tuesday to remove Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the caucus, the group of Liberal Party members elected to Parliament, is the latest development in a political crisis that has haunted Mr. Trudeau for nearly two months. The uproar stems from allegations that Mr. Trudeau and his senior aides tried to pressure Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general, to drop a prosecution against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., a Montreal engineering and construction company facing bribery-and-fraud charges. Instead, the former attorney general has alleged, senior Trudeau aides tried to direct her to seek an out-of-court settlement with the company.
Mr. Trudeau and other senior government officials have denied any wrongdoing, adding any conversations with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and her aides were appropriate and part of the cut-and-thrust of policymaking.
Mr. Trudeau said he made the decision after consulting with senior members of the Liberal Party caucus. Pressure among Liberal lawmakers to expel Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott escalated in recent days after it was disclosed the former attorney general recorded a mid-December conversation with a senior Trudeau adviser about SNC-Lavalin 's legal fate.
Ms. Philpott also angered Liberal Party lawmakers by saying she had lost confidence in the government, and she suggested in a recent interview with Maclean's magazine there was more to emerge from the SNC-Lavalin controversy.


Ex-Intelligence, Military Officials Sue Over Manuscript Screening Rules
WASHINGTON—A group of former U.S. intelligence and military officials filed suit against the Trump administration over rules that require them to submit book manuscripts and other writings for review long after leaving government service.
The lawsuit, filed in the federal district court in Maryland Tuesday against several intelligence leaders, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, argues the system of pre-publication review amounts to unconstitutional censorship.
Noting that federal law already prohibits disclosure of classified information, the plaintiffs say "arbitrary and discriminatory" pre-publication review rules violate former officials' First Amendment free speech rights, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.
"The government has a legitimate interest in protecting bona fide national-security secrets..But the imposition of a prior restraint is an extreme measure," the suit alleges.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.


Don't Count Joe Biden Out
Prospective Democratic presidential candidates now get opposition-research packets dumped on them before they enter the contest. Ask Joe Biden, who is edging closer to joining the 2020 Democratic primary. The former vice president was attacked Friday by a Bernie Sanders supporter for encroaching on her personal space at her 2014 campaign rally, smelling her hair and kissing the back of her head, leaving her uncomfortable. Conservative internet wizards then made the touchy-feely Mr. Biden into a meme as "Creepy Uncle Joe."
Mr. Biden's subsequent apologies and his promise Wednesday to be "more mindful" because "social norms are changing" are acknowledgments that he is struggling in today's #MeToo culture. This reinforces the sense that his first day as a presidential candidate will be his best one. Mr. Biden's lead in early polls is usually attributed to his strong name identification, an advantage that can quickly erode as the race progresses.
Mr. Biden also may be out of touch with a party that is increasingly progressive on policy. This could leave him apologizing endlessly for his Senate votes, including for the 1994 crime bill, welfare reform, the repeal of Glass-Steagall and the Iraq war. Factor in a March 28 Quinnipiac poll that found Democrats prefer, by 51% to 45%, a candidate who shares their views to the most electable candidate, and Mr. Biden could be in trouble.
Some observers say he made a mistake in not entering the race earlier. Talented staffers and operatives joined other campaigns, and Mr. Biden's lack of organization was evident in the slow-rolling response to Friday's accusation. Democrats also worry a Biden campaign wouldn't be nimble enough for the social-media age because the candidate himself isn't. And with no proven ability to rake in the small-dollar online donations fueling other campaigns, Mr. Biden is expected to have money problems.
But what if Mr. Biden's 7-point lead in the RealClearPolitics poll average is real?


Trump's Lawyer Urges IRS to Reject Democrats' Tax-Return Demand
WASHINGTON—A lawyer for President Trump said that House Democrats' request for the president's tax returns flouts constitutional constraints and should be rejected by the Internal Revenue Service.
In a letter to the Treasury Department's top lawyer, attorney William Consovoy began laying out a legal case that the Trump administration could use to refuse the congressional request. Mr. Consovoy argued there are limits to a 1924 law that requires the IRS to turn over any tax returns sought by Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), chairman of the House's tax-writing committee.
"If the IRS acquiesces to Chairman Neal's request, it would set a dangerous precedent," Mr. Consovoy wrote to Treasury Department General Counsel Brent McIntosh. "Once this Pandora's box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation."
Mr. Trump broke a four-decade tradition among presidents and major-party candidates in 2016 when he refused to disclose his tax returns. He sometimes has said he would release his returns once audits are complete, and he sometimes has said that no one cares about his taxes.
Mr. Neal on Wednesday used his power to turn the yearslong rhetorical fight over Mr. Trump's refusal to disclose his tax returns into a procedural and legal case. Mr. Neal is seeking six years of the president's personal returns and six years from some of Mr. Trump's business entities.


Thankless Duty at Homeland Security
Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation Sunday as secretary of Homeland Security is best understood as a ritual sacrifice for the failures of the American political system on immigration. Ms. Nielsen wasn't responsible for the surge of Central American migrants arriving at the border to claim political asylum, but Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress both needed a fall guy.
As he so often does, Mr. Trump had undercut Ms. Nielsen's authority recently by pulling the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to run the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But the President and White House staff had long set her up to take the blame for border failures with death by a thousand media leaks.
The real fault lies with a President and Congress who would rather exploit the migrant surge than do what it takes to stop it. Democrats want to blame Mr. Trump for family separations and supposed cruelty to immigrants. Mr. Trump wants to sound tough on border security to appeal to his political base. Ms. Nielsen was left to cope with the consequences of a system with perverse incentives for migrants to enter the U.S. illegally and stay for years as their asylum claims wait to be heard.
Mr. Trump named Kevin McAleenan, the head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary of Homeland Security. He is smart and highly competent. Mr. Trump could do much worse than nominate him as the permanent replacement. Some of the other names mentioned in the press—losing GOP gubernatorial candidates Kris Kobach and Ken Cuccinelli—are immigration grandstanders who don't inspire confidence.
Mr. Trump's immigration strategy is failing even on his own top priority of border security. He needs to get past his fixation with the border wall and make the case to the public and Congress for bipartisan immigration solutions.


Fix the VA, but Honor the Military Contract
Regarding Karl Zinsmeister's "If You Like Socialism, You'll Love the VA" (op-ed, April 3): I am a third-generation veteran and my oldest son is a veteran, but I am open to changing the system. Veterans Affairs benefits aren't "socialist," they are valid elements of the contract with the veteran. Our military personnel are under a binding agreement with the U.S. and can't quit at will without being prosecuted.
Whether the veteran's benefit is Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, medical benefits, a VA housing loan or one of the G.I. Bill education programs, these benefits are part of his or her contract with the government.
Ask a military pilot, infantryman, artilleryman or other soldier, sailor, airman or Marine how much life insurance would cost for someone flying a military aircraft or serving on the ground or at sea in a combat zone. It's unaffordable and in most cases isn't even obtainable.
I have also worked with veterans who returned from combat duty in Afghanistan and Iraq over the last 20 years. Several of them had been physically wounded and received recurring medical attention from the VA for their wounds. If they tried to sign up for civilian medical insurance those wounds would be considered a pre-existing condition.
If there is a problem with VA benefits, then let's have our elected officials fix it and quit bellyaching about the cost and whether or not it is "socialism."


Trump Plans to Sign Executive Orders to Expedite Pipelines
WASHINGTON—In a move to expedite oil and gas pipeline projects, President Trump plans to sign a pair of executive orders that would overhaul some environmental permitting rules and limit shareholder resolutions aimed at environmental concerns, according to a senior administration official.
The orders, which Mr. Trump plans to sign Wednesday, are in part aimed at blunting the ability of environmental activists and state regulators to use the Clean Water Act to obstruct oil and gas pipeline projects, the official said.
"There are a lot of problems with the way the Clean Water Act is being interpreted," the official said. "These two executive orders will promote the development of new energy infrastructure, create jobs and provide affordable energy to consumers."
Mr. Trump is seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to streamline government reviews and speed up energy projects. Interstate pipeline projects, in particular, have faced delays, with new lines to take natural gas to coastal consumers stalled for years under court and regulatory challenges.
But decades of law and court precedent often underpin those challenges, and even some of Mr. Trump's supporters agree with legal experts and analysts who say his ability to make changes is limited without new laws from Congress or the states.


House Freshmen Grab Attention, but a Sophomore Democrat Is Changing the House Agenda
WASHINGTON—House Democratic freshmen have captured the limelight, but lawmakers said behind the scenes, second-term Rep. Pramila Jayapal is steering the progressive legislative agenda.
While Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) may have the most famous initials inside the Beltway, with nearly four million Twitter followers and international media scrutiny, the influence of the sophomore Democrat from Washington state is becoming a force party leaders must reckon with.
The co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Ms. Jayapal in February introduced the Medicare for All bill that sparked a national debate on the 2020 campaign trail over its merits. During the government shutdown, she highlighted Democrats' demands to counter the administration's immigration-enforcement policies. And this week, she led a rebellion among liberals over federal spending levels that thwarted Democratic leaders' plans to pass a two-year budget proposal.


Ex-Lobbyist David Bernhardt Confirmed as Interior Secretary
WASHINGTON—The Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as interior secretary, putting another former advocate for business interests at the forefront of the Trump administration's environmental and energy policy.
Mr. Bernhardt, 49 years old, was confirmed by a vote of 56 to 41, largely on party lines. A handful of Democrats voted for him despite opposition from some liberal critics who said Mr. Bernhardt is too cozy with energy companies and agricultural businesses.
Like the new Environmental Protection Agency leader, Andrew Wheeler, Mr. Bernhardt was once a lobbyist and lawyer for several businesses that still have frequent business with his department. He has pledged to maintain an ethical culture at the Interior Department, including creating safeguards designed keep his former energy-industry clients at arm's length.
Mr. Bernhardt also has pledged to balance the need for environmental safeguards with the administration's priority on opening public lands to miners and drillers to boost the nation's energy production.
After the vote, the department in a brief statement noted "significant bipartisan support." Democrats Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona voted for him, as did Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats.


Ex-Venezuela Military Spy Chief Arrested
CARACAS, Venezuela—A former Venezuelan military intelligence chief long sought by U.S. prosecutors on drug charges was arrested Friday in Spain, Spanish and U.S. authorities said.
Hugo Carvajal was detained in Madrid by Spanish police acting on an indictment from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. The indictment was unsealed Friday as Washington pushes its allies in Latin America and Europe to dial up the pressure on Venezuela's leftist leader, Nicolás Maduro, and get him out of office. It isn't clear, however, that the arrest will have the intended effect.
The U.S. indictment accuses Mr. Carvajal, one of the few high-ranking former military officers to have broken ranks with Mr. Maduro, of having coordinated the transport of 5.6 metric tons of cocaine from Venezuela to Mexico in April 2006 with the intent of getting it to the U.S. There was no immediate response from Venezuela's government to his arrest.
Trump administration officials have called on high Venezuelan military officials to abandon their support for Mr. Maduro's authoritarian regime. But Mr. Carvajal's arrest could undermine rather than boost that effort, said Geoff Ramsey, an analyst who tracks Venezuela for the Washington Office on Latin America, a research group.
"It's logical to fear that now if you break from the regime, you'll end up in a prison cell in Miami," Mr. Ramsey said. "Rather than incentivizing a break, instead they only provide incentives for people to stay and go down with the ship."


Powerful Storms in South Kill at Least Three People
Powerful storms that killed at least three people swept across the South on Sunday after spawning suspected tornadoes that left more than 20 people injured and multiple homes and businesses damaged or without power.
One person was killed in northeastern Mississippi when a tree crashed onto his trailer, Monroe County Road Manager Sonny Clay said at a news conference, adding that a tornado had struck. Another 19 were taken to hospitals, including two who were in critical condition.
A tornado was reported in the area 140 miles southwest of Memphis, Tenn., at the time.
National Weather Service meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down Saturday in the Vicksburg, Miss., area. No injuries were reported there, but officials said several businesses and vehicles were damaged. Trees were down throughout the hilly city on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi.
The roof of a hotel in New Albany, Miss., was damaged, although the cause was unclear. Mississippi State University's 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado came near the school's campus in Starkville.


The West and Middle East Dictators
Another spring, another set of political crises in the Arab world. This time autocratic rulers, long past their "sell by" dates, have fallen in Algeria and Sudan. In both countries, factionalized ruling elites, insulated for decades from political pressures other than backstairs intrigue, now scramble to satisfy angry throngs of protesters without any idea how this can be done.
We can recite the mantras of development theory and democracy promotion: Economic reform and political opening are what the region needs. Such platitudes are as useless as they are true. An inexorable buildup of economic and social pressure, like an upwelling of molten rock from beneath the Earth's crust, threatens to engulf the dysfunctional postcolonial social orders in states from Pakistan to North Africa, and nobody, in the region or in the West, has the slightest idea what to do about it.
The region's political elites lack the technical competence, political coherence, public legitimacy and disinterested ethos required both to impose the necessary reforms and to make them a success. The protesters in the street lack the organization, political experience, ideological clarity and technical knowledge that a new ruling class would need. Growing populations, stagnant or falling hydrocarbon revenues, and the cumulative effects of corruption and poor investment decisions have combined to produce economic and social dysfunction on a late-Soviet scale. Governments are losing their ability to stave off the day of reckoning by passing out a few more subsidies or a few more make-work jobs to dull the sharp edge of public discontent.
To understand the limited and unhappy choices the West has today in the Middle East, we must give up the expensive delusion that we know how to cure the region's ills. The Western mix of technocratic administration, market innovation, centrist democratic politics and social liberalism will do well to survive where it is already established; at the moment there is not much it can do for underdeveloped regions.
The Middle East will have to find its own way, and while some societies are considerably better prepared than others to do so, the process is likely to be painful and prolonged. For the foreseeable future there won't be enough jobs for young people. Governments will fail to provide the political fulfillment that educated populations seek. The attractions of life in the West will glitter tantalizingly, but neither Europe nor anywhere else will voluntarily accept anything like the numbers of people who seek to immigrate.


The Longest War Needs Fresh Thinking
Three American Marines and a civilian contractor were killed in Afghanistan last week, the latest casualties in America's longest foreign war. After almost 18 years of fighting, the U.S. still seems to have no clear goals, no clear measures of success or failure, and no clear prospect of victory in Afghanistan or the broader war against terrorism. To refocus and make good on the nearly 7,000 American lives lost combating this threat, Congress should mandate a comprehensive review of U.S. counterterrorism strategy.
An important first step is to complete a comprehensive history of the war on terror. The Army recently released a military history of the Iraq war, but a broader accounting is needed, including other theaters as well as diplomacy, reconstruction and stabilization, homeland security and efforts against terrorism financing.
To ensure prompt access to information not yet available to the public, Congress should charter the review in a statute. Given the tendency in Washington for every debate to divide along party lines, the review should be conducted by an evenly divided panel, so that recommendations would necessarily be bipartisan. Inevitably some commissioners or staff members will have been participants in some part of the war. But a sufficiently broad commission and staff should have enough offsetting personal experiences to prevent this exercise from becoming an opportunity to fight long-past bureaucratic battles.
Senior policy makers who served in the past three administrations may object that such a review would still inevitably become politicized. But a case could be made that U.S. national-security policy isn't politicized enough. American voters should be made more aware of what their leaders have done to combat terrorism and how it has failed and succeeded.
With nearly 60,000 casualties across all theaters of the war on terror, it's time to take stock of how the U.S. has conducted itself in a war that is still not won (or lost).


Getaway Driver in 1981 Brinks Heist Is Granted Parole
Judith Clark, the getaway driver in a 1981 armored car robbery in suburban New York that left two police officers and a security guard dead, has been granted parole after spending nearly four decades in prison, state officials said Wednesday.
As a member of the radical group Weather Underground, Ms. Clark drove the getaway vehicle for the robbery in Rockland County, in which $1.6 million in cash was stolen. Three victims, Nyack police Sgt. Edward O'Grady and Officer Waverly "Chipper" Brown and Brinks guard Peter Paige, were fatally shot.
Although Ms. Clark, now 69 years old, wasn't at the immediate scene of the shootings, she was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery and sentenced to 75 years to life in prison for her role in the heist.
Over time she became a model inmate who received various degrees and trained service dogs. Some Democratic politicians and legal groups began lobbying for her release, saying she was sentenced to a longer prison term than others involved in the crime. Gov. Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence in 2016. She would otherwise not have been eligible for parole until 2056.
Dozens of current and former elected officials signed a letter in support of Ms. Clark ahead of an April 3 hearing. In a 2-1 decision released Wednesday, the parole board members said Ms. Clark's "callous disregard for the wellbeing of some, in favor of others, is a disgrace."


Democrats Diverge in How to Respond to Mueller's Report
Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants impeachment. Sen. Cory Booker doesn't want it on the table yet. Many, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, say Congress's investigations should continue. Mayor Pete Buttigieg says the ultimate arbiter should be the voters.
Democratic presidential hopefuls are calibrating how to respond to special counsel Robert Mueller's report amid concerns the issue could backfire with swing voters and drown out their broader agendas.
The moves on the campaign trail come as House Democrats are set to review their next steps on the Mueller report during a Monday conference call. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said she doesn't support impeachment, saying it would be too divisive and distract from the Democratic Party's efforts to win the White House in 2020.
Mrs. Pelosi is expected to convey a continued wariness of impeachment proceedings on the call, according to a House Democratic aide. It was unclear Sunday whether Democratic leaders would support another move, a formal reprimand, or censure, of President Trump, but some House Democratic aides thought it was unlikely.
Mrs. Pelosi faces differing opinions from Democratic House members, with some eager to begin impeachment proceedings and others concerned about how such a move would play out politically.


Libya Says Trump's Talk With Militia Leader Could Drive Up Oil
President Trump's outreach to a rogue Libyan general could push oil prices higher, the head of the country's United Nations-backed government said Sunday.
Mr. Trump spoke last week with militia leader Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive earlier this month to seize the Libyan capital of Tripoli, signaling a potential reverse of longstanding U.S. support for the U.N.-recognized government. The two men discussed a "shared vision" for the country in a phone conversation, the White House said Friday.
Messrs. Trump and Haftar talked about "ongoing counterterrorism efforts and the need to achieve peace and stability in Libya," the White House said. Mr. Trump recognized Mr. Haftar's efforts in "fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources, and the two discussed a shared vision for Libya's transition to a stable, democratic political system," the White House said.
Fayez al-Sarraj, prime minister of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord, said he had no confirmation from the Trump administration that it has changed course, but added that the continuation of the conflict would boost oil prices.
"Oil prices..usually rise if wars or unrest occur in oil-exporting countries," he said in an emailed interview from Tripoli.


The Most Telling Impeachment Poll
When asked by a reporter at the White House on Monday if he's worried about impeachment, President Donald Trump responded, "Not even a little bit." Most Democrats running for President don't seem to think he should be worried, either. In fact they don't even want to talk about it.
The reaction of this particular cohort of Democrats is interesting because after Donald Trump and his team, they are the people with the most at stake in the issue this year. Eventually one will earn the right to face Mr. Trump in the 2020 general election but right now they are vying for Democratic votes and donations.
Unlike Mr. Trump's principal House inquisitors who occupy safe seats and whose only genuine political risk is attracting a primary challenge for insufficiently "resisting" the President, the presidential candidates need to build national coalitions. And with one notable exception they are generally signalling that the Mueller report failed to deliver an obstruction case against the President.
Mr. Trump for his part seems happy to address the issue. Yesterday he tweeted:
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Then this morning, Mr. Trump took to his favorite social media platform again to say:


NSA Recommends Dropping Phone-Surveillance Program
The National Security Agency has recommended that the White House abandon a surveillance program that collects information about U.S. phone calls and text messages, saying the logistical and legal burdens of keeping it outweigh its intelligence benefits, according to people familiar with the matter.
The recommendation against seeking the renewal of the once-secret spying program amounts to an about-face by the agency, which had long argued in public and to congressional overseers that the program was vital to the task of finding and disrupting terrorism plots against the U.S.
The latest view is rooted in a growing belief among senior intelligence officials that the spying program provides limited value to national security and has become a logistical headache.
Frustrations about legal-compliance issues forced the NSA to halt use of the program earlier this year, the people said. Its legal authority will expire in December unless Congress reauthorizes it.
It is up to the White House, not the NSA, to decide whether to push for legislation to renew the phone-records program. The White House hasn't yet reached a policy decision about the surveillance program, according to the people familiar with the matter.


On the Russian Front in Ukraine
Berdyans'ke, Ukraine
The morning of Ukraine's presidential election, Razumova Lyudmyla stood in the kitchen of her new house, less than a mile from the front line of a five-year war between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. Holding her infant grandson, who smiled as he occasionally spit up, she explained how violence has upended life in this coastal village.
In 2016 Russian artillery shells struck Ms. Lyudmyla's property, leaving her old house and a detached garage damaged and burning. Despite living among military checkpoints and minefields, she refused to leave. "I have lived here for 44 years—my whole life," Ms. Lyudmyla said. "My parents and grandparents lived here."
Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidency Sunday, trouncing incumbent Petro Poroshenko by nearly 50 points. Ms. Lyudmyla wouldn't tell me whom she supported. What she most wants is direct aid and an end to the war. Such fatigue is widespread in the Donetsk region, where 87% of voters picked Mr. Zelensky.
Some 13,000 people have been killed since Russian forces and sympathetic locals stormed Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and declared sham republics. The war mostly faded from American headlines as it became a bloody stalemate: It produces a steady stream of military and civilian casualties but the fundamentals don't change. Countless Ukrainians lack basic necessities like gas, electricity and running water. Land mines have produced more than 1,000 casualties since 2014 and will put innocents at risk for years to come.


Biden Raised $6.3 Million in First 24 Hours, Topping Rivals
WASHINGTON—Joe Biden's team said it raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours since launching his presidential campaign, surpassing his rivals' first-day hauls as he seeks momentum at the start of his third run for the White House.
The former vice president's campaign-opening fundraising spree exceeded that of former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who pulled in $6.1 million during his first day, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who collected $5.9 million in his first 24-hour span.
Mr. Biden, who announced his campaign on Thursday, entering a field of 20 major Democrats vying to challenge President Trump, said in an email that it was "proof we are running a truly grass-roots campaign." His quick financial start came on a day in which the 76-year-old fielded questions about his lengthy tenure in the Senate and said he wouldn't commit to only a single term if elected.
The former vice president has lacked a large online fundraising apparatus compared with rivals like Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke, and has sought to make up for that with a strong showing among traditional fundraisers. Mr. Biden's first-day showing, while large, was the result of months of planning, and his campaign team will need to sustain a quick pace against rivals who used their head start to build their war chests and networks of small donors.
Mr. Sanders leads the pack with more than $18 million raised during the quarter ended March, while Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported more than $12 million and Mr. O'Rourke had $9.3 million.


Pentagon Approves More Troops for Southern Border
The Pentagon has approved a request from the Department of Homeland Security for 320 additional U.S. troops at the southern border, and has approved expanded authorities that allow them to come into direct contact with migrants and asylum seekers, defense officials said.
Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan, who signed the order Monday to send lawyers, cooks and drivers, also agreed to provide the waivers on troops' interactions with migrants and asylum seekers.
The Defense Department in 2006 instituted an internal policy prohibiting military personnel from coming into contact with migrants, a response to the deployment that year of more than 6,000 National Guard members. U.S. law also prohibits the military from acting in a law-enforcement capacity on U.S. soil, and Monday's order states the troops won't perform law-enforcement functions.
"Unlike we have been doing since 2006, this new mission requires some of our personnel to come into closer contact with migrants," one defense official said.
The expanded authorities are likely to heighten concerns over the military's latest border deployment, which began just before the 2018 midterm election amid the Trump administration's concerns about large groups of people headed to the U.S. to seek asylum.


House Ethics Panel Reopens Probes of Three Republicans
WASHINGTON—The House Ethics Committee is reopening investigations into three Republican lawmakers accused of campaign-finance and insider-trading crimes and other violations, the committee said Friday.
The panel named lawmakers to lead inquiries into Reps. Chris Collins of New York, Duncan Hunter of California and David Schweikert of Arizona for the new session of Congress. The investigations of Messrs. Collins and Hunter will be on hold until the Justice Department concludes criminal cases launched against them.
The ethics committee is investigating Mr. Schweikert on allegations he misused government funds and failed to comply with rules regarding campaign contributions from congressional employees. An aide for Mr. Schweikert declined to comment.
Mr. Collins was arrested in August and charged with participating in an insider-trading scheme to sell the shares of an Australian biotechnology company before the public disclosure of a failed drug trial. He pleaded not guilty and initially suspended his campaign, but later said he would stand for re-election and won his seat. An aide to Mr. Collins didn't return request for comment.
Mr. Hunter and his wife were indicted by a federal grand jury last year on charges they had used more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for expenses they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford, including family vacations, the Justice Department said. Mr. Hunter and his wife pleaded not guilty and will go to court later this year. An aide to Mr. Hunter said the lawmaker is cooperating fully with the Ethics Committee and "is very much looking forward to resolving the matter at hand."


Sen. Enzi Won't Seek Re-Election
WASHINGTON—Sen. Mike Enzi (R., Wyo.) said Saturday that he wouldn't run for re-election in 2020, the latest Senate Republican to announce he would retire rather than seek to keep his seat.
Saying he wanted to use his remaining time on priorities such as controlling the debt, Mr. Enzi, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said, "I don't want to be burdened with the distractions of a campaign. After this term I will find other ways to serve."
It isn't clear who would run to replace Mr. Enzi. Some people have speculated that Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), who is chairwoman of the House Republican conference, may want the seat.
But other Republicans have said that Ms. Cheney may have ambitions to advance in the House, where her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, briefly served as minority whip.
Her office declined immediate comment on her thinking. In a statement, she praised Mr. Enzi as someone who "always put the interests of Wyoming first."


Roads and Bridges Can Bridge the Parties
'Finally—something America can agree on!" That was my thought seeing President Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer discuss infrastructure last week.
Transportation, which is only possible with safe, solid infrastructure, is essential to the U.S. economy. A nation that grows and makes things must also be able to move things. Yet transportation infrastructure hasn't kept pace with states' most pressing needs.
That problem won't be solved by piling even more debt on our children to finance central planning from Washington. Unfortunately, it appears that Congress and the White House are heading toward a $2 trillion federal spending plan. That's getting it wrong. Getting it right would require returning money and control back to the states.
When I became Ohio's governor in 2011, we got creative. With an infrastructure funding shortfall and no help in sight from Washington, we leveraged the untapped value of the Ohio Turnpike. By issuing bonds against future turnpike revenue, we put an additional $1.5 billion into our highways—all without raising the state gasoline tax. During my eight years as governor, Ohio invested a record $16.4 billion in transportation infrastructure, financing important repairs and construction.
We found solutions in Ohio despite a flawed system that leaves states and municipalities responsible for building and repairing their streets, highways and bridges but leaves most of the fiscal and decision-making power in Washington. The problem is made worse by stagnating federal gasoline-tax revenue, which weakens federal support to the states for transportation infrastructure.


U.S. Issues Warning to Venezuelan Military Officials
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration warned Venezuela's military and intelligence officials that continued support of President Nicolás Maduro's regime puts them at risk of targeted sanctions, in a fresh effort to encourage defections to the U.S.-supported political opposition.
Friday's message—issued by the U.S. Treasury Department as it blacklisted two more oil tankers allegedly shipping banned Venezuelan oil—follows disappointment within the administration that the military didn't abandon Mr. Maduro when opposition leader Juan Guaidó earlier this month called for the country's security forces to back him instead.
"Treasury's action today puts Venezuela's military and intelligence services, as well as those who support them, on notice that their continued backing of the illegitimate Maduro regime will be met with serious consequences," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on more than 150 government officials and state-owned businesses loyal to Mr. Maduro. Earlier this week, the administration lifted sanctions on a Venezuelan general who broke ranks with Mr. Maduro's regime in an effort to encourage other government officials and military officers to abandon the regime as well.
Mr. Mnuchin said Friday that the U.S. would take further action if Cuba, Mr. Maduro's longtime ally, continued to import Venezuelan oil.


Mueller's Restrained Approach May Clash With Democrats' Agenda
WASHINGTON—When he was FBI director, Robert Mueller operated on the principle that it was best to limit interactions with Congress in order to protect the agency from partisanship.
"Only go when it is unavoidable," wrote Andrew McCabe, a former deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in his book "The Threat," about Mr. Mueller's attitude toward journeys to Capitol Hill. "Minimize your exposure time, don't get too close to fissile material, keep something in between you and the danger."
Mr. Mueller's longstanding reluctance to be in the political arena now runs headlong into Democrats' desire that he walk the public through the decisions he made as special counsel in writing his report on Russian election interference.
The report didn't establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow and avoided concluding whether the president obstructed justice, though it said it wasn't exonerating him. Attorney General William Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, then decided that the incidents of possible obstruction cited in the report didn't rise to the level of a crime.
"No collusion, no obstruction," Mr. Trump has repeatedly said.


Crossing the Aisle to Streamline Regulation
Bipartisanship isn't dead, even when it comes to streamlining regulation. Sens. James Lankford (R., Okla.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) have introduced two bills with surgical fixes to the regulatory process—one to promote public engagement; the other, a review of existing regulations with an eye toward changing course if they aren't working. Presidents from both parties have pursued both objectives with uneven results, so a legislative fix would be salutary.
Government agencies have long been required to seek public comment on regulatory proposals. Yet the opportunities for public engagement often come after agencies have invested time and energy in researching problems and potential solutions, analyzing alternatives, and justifying their preferences within the agency and during interagency review. They may become locked into their proposals and less receptive to modifications, let alone dramatically different approaches.
The Early Participation in Regulations Act would require agencies to issue advance notices of proposed rule-making for significant regulations. Agencies would use these notices to share their early thinking on whether a problem requires a regulatory solution and what the options are. They could gather input from knowledgeable entities on what direction to take, available data, models, etc., before framing decisions or establishing positions.
If an agency takes this step at the outset of its internal deliberations, it should not slow the rule-making process. To the extent the advance-notice process invites input on deliberations that would otherwise have taken place behind closed doors, it may make the overall rule-making process more efficient.
Meanwhile, retrospective evaluation has a long tradition in the private sector and in programs financed through the fiscal budget, but it has gotten little traction in the regulatory arena. The Setting Manageable Analysis Requirements in Text Act—the Smart Act—would address that problem by requiring agencies to include in major regulations a framework for measuring effectiveness and to incorporate plans for gathering the information necessary for an ex post evaluation. Planning for retrospective review when the agencies (and commenters) are in the process of developing the final rule would focus their attention on how to evaluate a rule's ultimate costs and benefits at a time when the rule (and its alternatives) are foremost in their minds. After 10 years, agencies would be expected to assess the rule's outcomes, evaluate how well it is accomplishing its objectives, and determine whether it could be modified to achieve better results.


Disciplinary Trial Begins for Officer Accused in Eric Garner's Death
NEW YORK—Nearly five years after Eric Garner died following an altercation with a police officer, prompting protests across the U.S. over law-enforcement practices and race, a prosecutor repeated the Staten Island man's last words to a packed courtroom.
"I can't breathe," prosecutor Jonathan Fogel said Monday inside the New York Police Department's Manhattan headquarters, echoing the phrase Mr. Garner repeated 11 times before his death. "I can't breathe. I can't breathe."
Officer Daniel Pantaleo faces disciplinary charges of recklessly using force by chokehold and intentional strangulation in connection with Mr. Garner's death. The trial, prosecuted by lawyers from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, is an internal disciplinary proceeding within the NYPD.
Under a 2012 agreement with the police department, the watchdog agency has the authority to prosecute certain misconduct cases.
After the trial, an NYPD judge will make a recommendation to Police Commissioner James O'Neill. Mr. O'Neill has final say about possible punishments, ranging from dismissal to losing vacation days. The trial is expected to last about two weeks.


Liberals Who Cry Roe
Who would have thought that a Supreme Court ruling in an interstate tax dispute would devolve into a brawl over abortion politics? Such are our political times as the four liberal Justices on Monday chided their conservative colleagues for overturning a 40-year precedent, which progressives warn will create a stare decisis slippery slope to banning abortion.
At issue in Franchise Tax Board v. Hyatt was whether states enjoy sovereign immunity in other states' courts. California urged the Court to overturn its Nevada v. Hall (1979) precedent, which held that states aren't required to grant legal immunity to other states. Most do for comity purposes, and state courts have entertained only 14 cases by private citizens against other states in the past four decades.
The Court reasoned in Hall that states have a sovereign interest in protecting their citizens, and the Constitution doesn't explicitly require interstate sovereign immunity. But there are strong opposing constitutional arguments, which Justice Clarence Thomas explained in the 5-4 majority's opinion overturning Hall.
The Constitution "embeds interstate sovereign immunity" in its structure and design, Justice Thomas asserts. For example, states are required to afford citizens of each state "all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States." While interstate sovereign immunity isn't spelled out, the founders "took as given that States could not be haled involuntarily before each other's courts." In other words, conservatives aren't simply divining a constitutional penumbra.
The Hyatt case is a close call because originalist arguments swing both ways. "When a citizen brings suit against one State in the courts of another, both States have strong sovereignty-based interests," Justice Stephen Breyer observed in his dissent joined by his fellow liberals. Respect for stare decisis also cautions against overturning precedents willy-nilly.


U.S. Keeps Hungary Sanctions at the Ready Even as Trump Courts Orbán
The U.S. has readied sanctions against close associates of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán amid worries the Central European state is a growing liability for Western interests, people familiar with the matter said.
But the administration is choosing to stand pat for now in the hopes it can still persuade Mr. Orbán to deliver on longstanding security promises and remain in the Western fold, those people said.
The sanctions would target some of Hungary's wealthiest men under anticorruption powers. Several own media outlets that vocally support Mr. Orbán, prime minister for all but eight of the past 21 years.
Mr. Orbán, in Washington on Monday, drew praise from President Trump in his first Oval Office visit since 1998.
"Orbán is a highly respected leader all over Europe, a little bit controversial maybe, but that's OK," Mr. Trump said on Monday in the Oval Office, with the prime minister at his side. "You're doing a great job to keep your country safe."


Democrats in Swing Districts Are Torn Over Impeachment
WASHINGTON—House Democrats in swing districts said they were torn over whether Congress should launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, a decision that could play a central role in the 2020 election.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Democratic leaders see pursuing impeachment as politically risky, and potentially endangering their House majority. In the recent midterms, Democrats won 41 seats previously held by Republicans. To keep their majority, they must win many of those districts again in 2020, and the Democrats in those competitive seats have differing stances on how far to go in investigating Mr. Trump.
"I honestly feel like we're pretty split on that among the freshmen and even among the frontliners," said Rep. Katie Hill (D., Calif.), referring to the Democrats holding seats in more conservative-leaning districts. Ms. Hill, who said she was "on the fence" on impeachment, said many fellow newly elected Democrats were weighing the need to conduct congressional oversight, and potentially an impeachment inquiry, against the desire of some more centrist voters to move on.
Ms. Hill won her southern California district in 2018, flipping a seat Republicans had held since 1993.
On Wednesday, at a meeting of House Democrats, Mrs. Pelosi counseled patience. She has previously said impeachment wouldn't be politically worth it as Democrats prepare to defend their House majority, and that she wouldn't support impeachment proceedings barring significant new revelations.


The Consequences of Asking the Census Citizenship Question
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the decennial census.
The plan is controversial because it could lead to an undercount of the number of people living in the country.
The decennial population figures determine how many U.S. representatives each state receives, how congressional and state legislative districts are drawn and how much federal money each state gets.
New evidence filed Thursday in federal courts in Manhattan suggests that adding the question would intentionally disadvantage Latinos and Democrats by facilitating the use of citizen voting-age population—rather than total population—for redistricting.
But an undercount would likely have ramifications for states and the private sector as well. And because the census contributes baseline data to numerous other surveys, the consequences would extend well beyond 2020.


White House Special Counsel Emmet Flood to Depart
WASHINGTON—President Trump said Saturday that Emmet Flood, a lawyer who joined the White House to help with the Russia investigation, would leave the job on June 14.
"He has done an outstanding job – NO COLLUSION - NO OBSTRUCTION! Case Closed!" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. "Emmet is my friend, and I thank him for the GREAT JOB he has done."
Special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded report detailed a "sweeping and systemic" effort by the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trump's behalf. It also concluded that the special counsel couldn't establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
Mr. Mueller's report outlined Mr. Trump's myriad efforts to interfere with or shut down the special-counsel investigation but didn't recommend charges. "This report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him," the report said.
That has fueled calls among congressional Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has resisted those demands, saying investigations must continue before a decision is made on impeachment.


Notable & Quotable: Bill Barr on Bias
Jan Crawford interviewing Attorney General William Barr for "CBS This Morning," May 31:
Crawford: The president has tweeted and said publicly that some in the [FBI's] upper echelon, [James] Comey, [Andrew] McCabe, etc., committed treason. I mean do you agree with that?
Barr: Well, I—as a lawyer I always interpret the word treason not colloquially but legally. And you know the very specific criteria for treason—so I don't think it's actually implicated in the situation that we have now. . . .
Crawford: But it seems like you have a concern that there may have been a bias by top officials in the FBI as they looked at whether to launch and conduct this investigation?


'A Series of Trips': What Eisenhower Wrote His Wife on Eve of D-Day
The day before he launched the greatest amphibious landing in the history of war, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower paused to tell his wife not to take it personally if he didn't write her for a few days.
Ike's little-known letter to Mamie reveals the supreme Allied commander juggling martial and marital duties at the moment he ordered 155,000 troops to storm the Normandy beaches, which started the liberation of western Europe from the Nazi Germans.
"Starting tomorrow," Gen. Eisenhower wrote on June 5, 1944, "I have a series of trips that will last without interruption from six to ten days."
"So if you have a lapse in arriving letters, don't jump at the conclusion that I don't want to write—I'll simply have no opportunity to pick up a pen," Gen. Eisenhower assured his wife.
He kept the handwritten letter vague, apparently to avoid giving away war plans should it fall into German hands. He may even have mentioned his "series of trips" in an effort to persuade the enemy that the landing was still a week or more off.


Antitrust, Free Speech and Google
Donald Trump's 2016 campaign promised to use antitrust law against oligopolies it said were "destroying an American democracy that depends on a free flow of information and freedom of thought." The Justice Department's investigation of Google may appear to fulfill this pledge. But Makan Delrahim, who heads the antitrust division, has voiced skepticism.
In a 2018 address, he rejected the notion that "antitrust enforcers should step beyond consumer welfare and think about . . . values like the free speech the First Amendment protects." He worried it would lead to subjective enforcement because "Republican and Democrat prosecutors, or those of any party or political orientation, carry with them their own perceptions of what is good and bad for our democracy."
Yet platform neutrality isn't a strictly partisan issue. When Facebook temporarily blocked Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign ad in March, she tweeted: "I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTech." Her Republican colleague Ted Cruz agreed: "She's right—Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech."
The Justice Department does have authority to consider how Google's dominance affects the marketplace of ideas, and federal prosecutors routinely make decisions with partisan policy implications when enforcing campaign-finance, election-fraud, and voting-rights laws. Even in the antitrust context, regulators must consider viewpoint diversity in cable and broadcast mergers.
Special statutes apply to these industries, but there is also precedent to address similar concerns under the broader antitrust laws. In Associated Press v. U.S. (1945), the Supreme Court held that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 complemented the First Amendment, which "rests on the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public."


Get Rid of Surprise Medical Bills
Scott Kohan woke up in an Austin, Texas, emergency room after an attack that broke his jaw. The hospital was within his insurance network. But the oral surgeon who set his jaw wasn't. Mr. Kohan's insurer refused to pay the surgeon's $8,000 bill.
He's not alone. An estimated 51% of ambulance rides, 22% of emergency-department trips, and 9% of elective cases, in which patients have time for due diligence, lead to surprise bills. These typically come from providers who refuse to join insurance networks so they can charge astronomical fees.
Even patients who make all the right choices can't prevent surprise bills. Patients at in-network hospitals don't get to choose their anesthesiologists, for instance. It's hard for the market to discipline this behavior when patients can't avoid it. And because doctors and hospitals can implicitly threaten exorbitant surprise bills, they're able to extract higher rates from insurers, meaning higher premiums for everyone.
Congress should ban these predatory practices, but it should avoid the temptation of price controls. The Lower Health Care Costs Act, introduced last month by Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray aims to eliminate most surprise out-of-network medical billing. It's the most consequential bipartisan health-care reform of the ObamaCare era.
The bill offers three ways for Congress to address this problem. One would have policy makers regulate prices directly, while a second would establish an arbitration system to resolve disputes between health-care providers and insurers. Arbitration seems like a "light touch" solution, but it simply punts the problem to arbiters who will determine rates for each service. It's rate setting by fiat, only more expensive and opaque.


Sarah Sanders, Trump's Spokeswoman, to Leave White House
WASHINGTON—White House press secretary Sarah Sanders will leave her job at the end of the month to return to her home state of Arkansas, President Trump said Thursday.
"She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas," Mr. Trump tweeted.
Ms. Sanders assumed the role in July 2017, after Mr. Trump's first press secretary, Sean Spicer, left the job as the communications office struggled to find its footing. She has been a prominent defender of Mr. Trump, sparring regularly with the press, but has taken on a lower profile after the White House stopped holding regular press briefings.
Most news out of the White House now comes from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed and his impromptu question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Ms. Sanders hasn't held a formal briefing in the press room in months.
Mr. Trump interrupted an East Room event Thursday to call Ms. Sanders on stage. Ms. Sanders called the job an honor of a lifetime. "I've loved every minute, even the hard minutes," she said. "It's truly the most special experience. The only one I can think of that might top it, just a little bit, is the fact that I'm a mom."


England Needs a Slap, and So Does China
Now and then a country needs to get slapped. England does, or rather the United Kingdom, but I say England because I really mean London. Its entire leadership class has been undone since Brexit passed, three years ago this month. They've been overwhelmed, not equal to the moment.
They are like the hysterical blonde in 1940s and '50s movies. Something scary would happen, the monster was coming, and she'd start to scream and sob. Then another character, usually a man, would slap her hard across the face. In the shock of it she'd take hold of herself. I'm fairly certain this trope had to do with how directors saw their wives.
Anyway, London since Brexit has been the hysterical blonde. The British people passed Brexit in a national referendum many had requested for decades. It wasn't close—it won by a 3.8-point margin. Turnout was huge, 72% of eligible voters. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron, who opposed Brexit but called the referendum in a stupendous and foolish bet that his people saw things as he did, was forced to step down. Theresa May, who'd opposed Brexit but with less focus and commitment, rose from the debris and had a good start. "Brexit means Brexit," she said. And then she too misread the situation, on the ground and in Parliament. The argument didn't end. The European Union did what everyone knew it would do and tried to stop the jailbreak. Everything got drawn out and dragged down. The whole political class floundered under the strain.
If leaving the EU was a radical decision, it was deliberately and consciously so: For six weeks the question consumed the nation, and a decision was made.
Is it not obvious what must be done? This matter has to be resolved. A great nation can't function cut in two, with half the nation at the other half's throats. It can't go forward in history that way; it must be one thing or the other, as Lincoln said.


Government Watchdog Recommends Conway Be Removed From Post
WASHINGTON—A government watchdog recommended that top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway be removed from her post, citing repeated alleged violations of a rule that prohibits political activity by executive-branch staff.
In a statement Thursday, the Office of Special Counsel—which isn't affiliated with former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation—described Ms. Conway as a "repeat offender" of the Hatch Act for attacking Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity as a White House adviser.
"Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system—the rule of law," the letter said.
The office recommends to President Trump that he remove Ms. Conway from her post.
In response, the White House rejected the recommendation, calling the actions against Ms. Conway "deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process."


Egypt's Ousted Islamist President Morsi Has Died
CAIRO—Egypt's former President Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist leader freely elected in the aftermath of the country's 2011 uprising, died on Monday after spending the past six years as a prisoner following the military coup that deposed him.
A leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Morsi was a controversial figure in Egypt whose rise symbolized a fleeting moment of political freedom following the 2011 revolution that ended the three-decade dictatorship of his predecessor, President Hosni Mubarak, and helped catalyze a wave of rebellion across the Middle East.
Mr. Morsi, who was 67 years old, died after suffering a heart attack while appearing in a Cairo court where he was on trial on espionage charges, Egyptian state television reported.
Mr. Morsi's year in power divided Egyptians, and his downfall in a military takeover resulted in the crushing of the country's fledgling democracy and the dimming of democratic hopes throughout the region.
Mr. Morsi's family and supporters had long feared for his deteriorating health while in prison since 2013. His family and attorneys said in 2018 that he had been denied medical treatment for a range of conditions including diabetes and that he had been suffering from a recurring diabetic coma.


Supreme Court Sides With Property Owners in Local Land-Use Case
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Friday made it easier for property owners to challenge land-use regulations and seek compensation from the government, a ruling that revealed deep divisions between the court's conservative and liberal camps.
The court, in a 5-to-4 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, sided with a Pennsylvania woman who challenged a requirement by the rural community of Scott Township that she provide public access to a gravesite on her 90-acre property.
The chief justice, writing for the court's conservative majority, said landowner Rose Mary Knick could file a federal lawsuit that challenged a town ordinance on gravesite access and sought compensation for a "taking" of her property.
The decision overturned court precedent from 1985 that required property owners such as Ms. Knick to file litigation in state court first. Chief Justice Roberts said that requirement had proven to be "an unjustifiable burden" on property owners.
"Takings claims against local governments should be handled the same as other claims" for federal constitutional violations, the chief justice wrote in a 23-page opinion striking down the state-court-first requirement.


New York Farmers Bruised by Increased Labor Costs
New York farmers say they are straining under increased costs as a worker shortage has forced them to use a federal visa program to bring in temporary agricultural workers from other countries.
While farmers are grateful for the H-2A visas, which lets them import workers, some say their costs have ballooned while their revenue is mostly stagnant.
"For us, there is no non-H-2A labor," said Dennis Brawdy, partner with Amos Zittel and Sons in Erie County, which employs 72 workers this year. "Three to five years ago, we were 100% non-H-2A because there was an adequate amount of workers around," Mr. Brawdy said of the vegetable-growing and greenhouse operation.
As the U.S. has tightened border security in recent years, many agricultural companies that had relied on illegal immigrant laborers are turning to H-2A visas. More than 196,000 H-2A visas were granted in 2018, compared to about 89,200 in 2014, according to the U.S. Labor Department.
But getting H-2A workers is expensive. Farmers incur additional costs such as transportation, food and legal aid to bring them into the country, as well as guaranteeing them at least 75% of their pay. And once those workers arrive, the farmers also must provide housing and other amenities, unlike non-H-2A labor.


Trump Bucked Advisers on Proposed Iran Attack
WASHINGTON—President Trump bucked most of his top national-security advisers by abandoning retaliatory strikes in Iran on Thursday. In private conversations Friday, Mr. Trump reveled in his judgment, certain about his decision to call off the attacks while speaking of his administration as if removed from the center of it.
"These people want to push us into a war, and it's so disgusting," Mr. Trump told one confidant about his own inner circle of advisers. "We don't need any more wars."
In these conversations, Mr. Trump bemoaned the costs of a drone shot down by Iran—about $130 million before research and development—but told people the dollar figure would resonate less with U.S. voters than the potential casualties. The president has said estimates provided to him showed as many as 150 people could have been killed. He noted to confidants that each one of those Iranians had families, which would mean that hundreds more would be affected.
"I don't want to kill 150 Iranians," he told reporters on Saturday, adding that he has Iranian friends back home in New York. "I don't want to kill 150 of anything or anybody, unless it's absolutely necessary."
On Saturday, Mr. Trump backed a new course of action: another round of sanctions on Tehran to be formally announced on Monday, though he didn't offer any additional detail. The administration's current package of sanctions against Iran has pushed the country's economy into a multiyear contraction and increased tensions in the region. But the measures have yet to persuade Tehran to open negotiations with Mr. Trump, who is seeking an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.


Donald Trump's Iran Show
President Trump's Iran policy over the weekend was both erratic and masterful. Doves and isolationists, panicked by what they see as the administration's inexorable drift toward war, rejoiced when Mr. Trump announced that a military strike had been called back. Hawks criticized him for an Obama-like climb-down, but the announcement of cyberattacks and tightening sanctions helped smooth ruffled feathers.
The result? Mr. Trump more than ever dominates U.S. Iran policy; contending political factions within the administration and outside it must jockey for his support. And the more he talks and tweets about Iran, the less clear anyone is about his ultimate intentions.
None of this should be surprising. Consistently inconsistent on issues from trade with China and immigration from Mexico to Venezuela and North Korea and now Iran, Mr. Trump has been by turns more hawkish than any of his predecessors and dovish enough to thrill Sen. Rand Paul.
This president is first and foremost a showman. From his early real-estate days in 1970s New York through his time in reality television and into his third career in politics, Mr. Trump has understood and shrewdly deployed the power of fame. He has turned American politics into the Donald Trump Show, with the country and the world fixated on his every move, speculating feverishly about what will come next. Whether threatening on Twitter to rain down destruction from the sky, reining in the dogs of war at the last minute, or stage-managing high-stakes summit meetings, he is producing episodes of the most compelling reality show the world has ever seen.
Whether this helps or hurts American foreign policy is another question, but to turn intractable foreign-policy problems like North Korea's nuclear program into fodder for the Trump publicity machine represents a triumph of marketing ingenuity if not of national strategy. Unresolved foreign-policy crises normally weigh on a president's popularity; in Mr. Trump's case, they become plotlines that provide drama and suspense. When Kim Jong Un gives him lemons, Mr. Trump sets up a lemonade stand.


D.C. Squeezes Charters
The Washington, D.C. City Council on Wednesday is meeting to discuss charter schools. Let's hope someone asks Mayor Muriel Bowser why her administration is denying space to charters—at the same time it plans to spend millions to refurbish under-utilized traditional schools.
The most glaring example is the decision to evict AppleTree Early Learning Public Charter School from the campus of Jefferson Middle School, a traditional public school in the city's southwest. AppleTree is a top performing charter serving pre-K students with the aim of closing the achievement gap before these children get to kindergarten. For five years it has operated out of portable classrooms on the Jefferson Middle School campus while it looks for more permanent space.
But city officials now say AppleTree needs to be out by July 31 because they want to refurbish Jefferson. The eviction notice was signed by Deputy Mayor for Education Paul Kihn. The city plans to spend $80 million to modernize Jefferson and expand its capacity to 540 kids when it reopens—though there are only 340 kids enrolled now.
Meanwhile, the city has a waiting list of 11,000 children for charters. The advent of charters has been one of the great reforms of the D.C. school system, giving parents more good schools to choose from and providing competition for traditional schools. But as in New York, they often find themselves hostage to officials who deny them space.
If Mayor Bowser won't find space for well-performing charters such as AppleTree, maybe Congress—which passed the reform that led to charters opening in the district—should take steps to make it harder for city officials to jerk these charter kids around.


John Sanders Resigns as Head of Customs and Border Protection
A top U.S. border-enforcement official resigned amid growing clamor about the treatment of migrant children in U.S. custody, while the House approved billions of dollars in funding to address the surge of Central American families seeking asylum at the southwest border.
John Sanders, acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, submitted his resignation to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, effective late next week. He didn't give a reason for his departure, but people familiar with the agency's leadership said Mr. Sanders had been overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis and the frequent changes in personnel and policy direction inside the Trump administration.
President Trump said Tuesday that he hadn't spoken with Mr. Sanders about his resignation but that he knew of coming personnel changes at CBP. That raised the possibility of a new reshuffle involving Mark Morgan, installed a few weeks ago as acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The White House had previously sought to elevate Mr. Morgan at CBP, according to a former U.S. official.
The CBP has been one of the agencies charged with responding to the flow of adults and children from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The Trump administration has said this migration by people fleeing violence and poverty has brought the U.S.'s border infrastructure to a breaking point, and the surge has ignited an explosive public debate amid reports of worsening conditions of detained immigrants and several deaths of children in U.S. custody.
The changes in immigration-enforcement leadership come as attorneys and doctors have reported on squalid conditions at a holding facility in Clint, Texas, including disease outbreaks and dirty, hungry children caring for other children.


Warren vs. Warren on Government Day Care
Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week introduced the Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act, which would establish a network of federally subsidized and regulated day-care centers. The problem with this proposal is that it's bad for children.
Day care may be cost effective, but it is unhealthy for the emotional well-being of children under 3. Infants are neurologically fragile, and the first thousand days of life are a critical window of social-emotional right-brain development, which depends on the physical and emotional presence of the primary caregiver, usually the mother.
Mothers are biologically important to regulate children's emotions from moment to moment by soothing them when they are in distress—and also to buffer them from stress. Only after age 3 do children develop the ability to regulate their own emotions and become resilient to stress.
If the mother can't be with the child for the first three years, a consistent primary caregiver—ideally a relative—is the next-best alternative. If paid child care is necessary, the ratio of children to caregivers should be no greater than 3 to 1. That's simply not cost-effective in institutionalized day care. Even the most skilled, well-paid and empathic caregiver can't give sufficient care to more than three children under 3.
Some day-care advocates cite the benefits of early socialization. But children under 2 aren't equipped psychologically or emotionally to be social in a group setting. The day-care environment is stressful and overstimulating to an infant, whose nervous system is still developing, and who depends upon the primary caregiver for emotional security and feeling of safety.


Trump Is the Worst Kind of Socialist
"America will never be a socialist country," President Trump said as he launched his bid for re-election last week.
That declaration was an effort to frighten Americans and undermine growing support for expanding Medicare and Social Security—two popular programs that have long been derided as "socialist." Mr. Trump's declaration hypocritically ignores that he and his Republican colleagues are the nation's leading purveyors of an insidious form of corporate socialism, which uses government power and taxpayer resources to enrich Mr. Trump and his billionaire friends.
When we defeat Mr. Trump in this election, we are going to end his corporate socialism and use those resources to create a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that benefits all people.
Consider the corporate socialism we've seen on Wall Street, where the high priests of unfettered capitalism reign. As you will recall, Wall Street's deification of "free markets" went out the window in 2008 as they watched the financial crisis caused by their own greed and illegal behavior threaten the existence of some of the largest financial institutions in the country. Suddenly, Wall Street became strong supporters of big-government socialism.
They begged the federal government for unprecedented taxpayer assistance, and Congress provided them with the largest bailout in history. The major banks received some $700 billion from the Treasury and trillions in low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve.


Trump Offers to Meet North Korea's Kim
President Trump said he is willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, even if just to "say hello," which drew interest from Pyongyang.
Mr. Trump also said he would be willing, while at the demilitarized zone, to cross the border into North Korea, potentially becoming the first U.S. president to do so.
The offer by Mr. Trump and North Korea's apparent receptiveness came in a round of diplomacy conducted over Twitter, with Mr. Trump saying at a news conference that Mr. Kim learned of his offer through the social-media platform.
Mr. Trump arrived Saturday in South Korea after wrapping up a summit of leaders from Group of 20 nations in Osaka, Japan. In Seoul, he had dinner with President Moon Jae-in, and the two are scheduled to meet Sunday morning in Seoul.
His initial offer for a meeting with Mr. Kim came in a tweet Saturday morning in Japan.


Taliban Attack Kills Dozens in Kabul
KABUL—Taliban militants detonated a vehicle bomb and then stormed a government building in central Kabul on Monday, leaving dozens of people dead in the latest convulsion of violence to hit Afghanistan.
The morning rush-hour blast, which shook the center of the Afghan capital and sent smoke billowing into the clear summer sky, came as the latest round of talks between U.S. and Taliban negotiators to end the nearly 18-year Afghan war entered a third day in the Gulf state of Qatar.
In an indication of how a handful of militants can paralyze much of a city, more than eight hours after the initial explosion police commandos were still battling militants holed up in high-rise apartment buildings near the site of the blast in the Puli Mahmood Khan district of the capital.
The rattle of automatic-weapons fire and the thud of explosions could be heard several blocks away, as armored vehicles carrying police reinforcements raced to the buildings surrounding the still smoldering blast site.
As the vehicles raced by, an elderly man, Aref Noorullah, sat hunched on the ground near the curb, his knees to his chest, wiping tears from his eyes with his scarf. He said he had walked across much of the city, a distance of more than 6 miles, after learning that his 38-year-old son, the father of seven children, had been killed in the blast. His son's body was still half-buried in the rubble, and it would be hours before he could recover the remains.


Universities Settle Alzheimer's Expert Hiring Dispute
The University of Southern California has agreed to pay $50 million to the University of California to resolve a long-running legal dispute over Southern Cal's 2015 hiring of a leading Alzheimer's disease researcher from the University of California, San Diego, according to the settlement agreement.
The settlement resolves a conflict that highlighted the growing financial stakes for academic institutions when it comes to disease and drug research. Academic research centers manage significant corporate and federal grants, including large grants increasingly given to institutions with the experts who conduct cutting-edge research and drug trials.
The big money at stake, and the possibility to share in the fruits of any commercial successes, can lead to significant tension over ownership of intellectual work.
As part of the settlement, USC said in a statement posted on its website Tuesday that it and the researcher, Dr. Paul Aisen, regretted the manner in which he and members of his staff left UC San Diego and brought research assets to USC, saying it "created disruption to UC San Diego."
"These actions did not align with the standards of ethics and integrity which USC expects of all its faculty, administrators, and staff," USC said in the statement. A USC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the university's statement.


Military Brass, Troops Joining Trump at July 4 Event on National Mall
WASHINGTON—Top military leaders from across the services, as well as thousands of troops, will join President Trump for the July 4 celebration in Washington, the Pentagon said Wednesday, even as some defense officials privately expressed concerns about the military's role in the event.
Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper; Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the commandant of the Coast Guard and the No. 2 leaders of the Navy, Army and Marine Corps will attend the events on the National Mall. Civilian leaders of the services also will participate, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
In addition, the Pentagon said it distributed 5,000 tickets provided by the White House for the event to the services, passing them on to troops and their families.
The Pentagon has said it wouldn't have estimates for the costs of its participation in the parade until next week at the earliest. The cost will include staffing roughly 500 ceremonial troops, fueling and transporting airplanes and military vehicles, and other support, defense officials said.
In a tweet Wednesday, the president said the price tag was worth it.


Despite Feud Over Busing, Harris and Biden Agree on Current Policies
Sen. Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden cannot agree on the issue of federally-mandated busing in the 1970s. But for a modern-day approach to de facto school segregation, the Democratic presidential candidates are on the same page.
Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden clashed over school integration and busing last week, when the California Democrat confronted Mr. Biden on his past opposition to certain busing programs during the first presidential debate.
Ms. Harris cited her personal experience of being bused to school in the 1970s as part of integration efforts that Mr. Biden, then a senator from Delaware, spoke out against. The former vice president has said Ms. Harris misrepresented his record.
However, both campaigns say their respective candidates support the same congressional proposal designed to mitigate segregation in school in a way that is much broader than busing alone and doesn't include any federal mandates.
Mr. Biden, 76, and Ms. Harris, 54, support a bill written by Rep. Marcia Fudge (D., Ohio) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) that would give federal grants to "support voluntary local efforts to increase racial diversity and socioeconomic diversity."


Antibribery Group Presses Japan to Increase Its Enforcement
An international organization has called on Japan to step up enforcement of its foreign-bribery laws, saying the Asian nation has one of the least stringent enforcement rates given the size and range of its economy.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions said Japan has made some progress since the previous evaluation in 2011 and lauded implementation of new rules to close some loopholes in its regulation.
The report is part of the fourth phase of evaluation by the OECD Working Group on Bribery, which monitors and evaluates the implementation and enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention by its 44 member nations. This phase focuses on enforcement, detection and corporate liability, and assesses each country's needs and how it has implemented the recommendations from the previous evaluation.
Newsletter Sign-up Risk and Compliance Journal Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. PREVIEW
The group said that over the last two decades, Japan has detected 46 foreign bribery allegations, investigated 30 of them, and prosecuted five cases that resulted in conviction of 12 individuals and two companies.
The Working Group on Bribery also said Japan's police and prosecution lack proactivity in investigations, according to the report, which was adopted by the Group in June.
"Japan's enforcement rate is not commensurate with the size and export-oriented nature of its economy or the high-risk regions and sectors in which its companies operate," the group said in a statement Wednesday.
The report also acknowledges several antibribery legislative developments in Japan. For instance, Japan in 2017 amended its legislation to allow for the possibility of confiscating proceeds of foreign bribery and the criminalization of laundering of such proceeds, the report says.
The country in 2018 also introduced a new procedure that could encourage those with firsthand knowledge of a scheme to provide evidence or cooperate with authorities, according to the report.
Some key recommendations for Japan from the group include extending the time limit for filing charges and increasing the maximum fines for individuals and companies in foreign bribery cases. It also recommends that Japan review its laws so it can have jurisdiction over cases where bribes are paid by non-Japanese employees for Japanese companies operating abroad.
Japan will submit a written report to the working group by June 2021 on its implementation of recommendations and its enforcement efforts.

Adam Smith's Refreshing Idea of Justice
In a world full of people looking to impose their concepts of justice on others, it's refreshing to revisit Adam Smith's thinking. One of the best-known quotations from "The Wealth of Nations" (1776) defines natural liberty: "Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those of any other man."
Smith inserted the condition "as long as he does not violate the laws of justice" because it was central to his conception of liberty. Everyone remembers the phrase "free to pursue his own interest," which is often turned into "selfish interest." But Smith's conception of human sociability and economy—I like the word "humanomics"—was deeper than modern utilitarianism.
What did Smith mean by justice, and why is it so important for understanding his message? The carefully articulated answer was in his first book, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759).
For Smith, justice was the negative image of his definition of injustice. Intentionally hurtful actions alone deserve punishment because they cause a feeling of resentment in all the other members of the community. Rules that punished in proportion to social resentment emerged naturally in early communities before centralized government. Their only purpose was to defend the innocent against real, positive evil. Justice, therefore, was a residual—the infinite set of permissible actions remaining after a finite set of actions were ruled worthy of punishment out of common experience.
Imagine a large playing field on which people explore, discover and innovate, but only within well-defined boundaries beyond which they may not range without penalty. These "foul lines" will change, based on consent, with societal experience, culture and technology.


Trump Comments on Immigrants Could Factor in Census Case, Judge Says
WASHINGTON—A federal judge in Maryland said Wednesday that President Trump's public remarks about immigrants and personal insistence on placing a citizenship question on the census could help determine whether the government intended to discriminate against Hispanics by adding the query.
Justice Department attorneys had insisted over the past year that Mr. Trump had no involvement in adding the citizenship question. They argued that anything the president said about immigrants was legally irrelevant, since there was no proof Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, even knew Mr. Trump's views.
Government lawyers "repeatedly represented to this Court that Secretary Ross, and not President Trump, acted 'as the sole decisionmaker' as it relates to the addition of a citizenship question to the Census, and that, as a result, any evidence of statements made by candidate, President-elect, or President Trump suggesting discriminatory animus towards immigrant communities was not relevant," U.S. District Judge George Hazel's order said.
But with the Trump administration now seeking to replace its entire legal team, Judge Hazel said the new attorneys would have to account for potential discrepancies between the government's prior positions and "recent developments" since the Supreme Court, ruling last month in a separate case from New York, blocked the citizenship question on procedural grounds. The court found nothing wrong in principle with a citizenship question, but ruled that Mr. Ross "contrived" its rationale in claiming he needed more data to protect minority voting rights. The decision sent the issue back to the Commerce Department.
On the eve of the Supreme Court's June census ruling, however, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., told Judge Hazel to begin proceedings on the equal-protection claim, after an unrelated lawsuit in North Carolina turned up evidence tying a deceased Republican political consultant to Trump administration efforts to add the citizenship question.


Following Epstein's Arrest, Spotlight Shifts to His Longtime Associate
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a British media baron, was a fixture for years in Manhattan's social scene, often written about in tabloids for her close ties to British royalty and to a mysterious financier named Jeffrey Epstein.
But Mr. Epstein's arrest last week on sex-trafficking charges has brought renewed attention to her alleged role as one of his top aides.
Ms. Maxwell, 57 years old, has been accused by three women in affidavits and other court filings of recruiting young women for Mr. Epstein and training them for sex. Two of the women have alleged that Ms. Maxwell, together with Mr. Epstein, sexually assaulted them, according to the filings.
The accusations were made as early as 2009 in lawsuits covering conduct that allegedly occurred from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. Together with the federal indictment in New York against Mr. Epstein, the civil cases describe an enterprise centered on procuring and sexually exploiting young women, and intimidating them into silence.
One accuser in a 2017 lawsuit called Ms. Maxwell "the highest-ranking employee" of that alleged enterprise, a role in which she was said to have had managed Mr. Epstein's household and his sex life.


Trump Administration Appeals to Supreme Court in Border-Wall Case
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration filed an emergency appeal Friday with the Supreme Court that seeks to start construction on sections of a southern U.S. border wall with $2.5 billion in funds not approved by Congress.
The move comes after two lower courts based in California blocked the administration from building parts of the proposed wall without congressional approval. Those courts said Congress controls the power of the purse, and they noted that lawmakers specifically declined to give the president all the money he was seeking to erect border barriers.
The administration's latest legal move, filed by U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, thrusts the Supreme Court into another hot-button political issue related to immigration just two weeks after the justices began a summer break.
Last month, the court in a 5-to-4 ruling effectively blocked the administration from asking U.S. residents on the 2020 census if they are citizens.
Mr. Francisco said lower courts in the border-wall case misread the law and blocked the administration from taking steps "in the national interest." He also said the courts wrongly allowed environmentalists and southern border community organizations to proceed with their lawsuit.


Appeals Court Upholds Decision Barring Trump Birth-Control Exemptions
A federal appeals court unanimously upheld a lower court decision blocking a revised set of Trump administration rules allowing employers with religious or moral objections to opt out of providing their workers with birth-control coverage.
The ruling late Friday by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is a blow to the administration, which had prioritized weakening an Obama-era mandate requiring employers to offer free contraceptive health coverage to their employees—a top concern for Catholic and antiabortion groups. The court's decision, which applies nationwide, makes it much less likely that the administration will be able to fashion an exemption acceptable to the courts.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately return a request for comment. The agency is expected to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
The Trump administration's rules, issued in November by the DHHS, would have exempted a broad swath of employers from the mandate contained in the Affordable Care Act. Those rules represented a second attempt by Trump officials to create such an exemption, after a first set was blocked in 2017.
Judge Patty Schwartz, writing for the court, said the Affordable Care Act plainly states women must be provided preventive health services. "Nowhere in the enabling statute did Congress grant the agency the authority to exempt entities from providing insurance coverage for such services," she wrote.


Syrian Government Intensifies Strikes on Opposition Stronghold
BEIRUT—By his front door in northwest Syria, Ahmad Haraki keeps a suitcase packed with bare essentials in case Syrian government and Russian airstrikes force him to make a quick escape.
"We don't own much, since we've been moving from the beginning," the 32-year-old father of two said by phone from Idlib province, the country's last remaining opposition stronghold. "The airstrikes are taking a toll, not only on our daily lives, but also mentally."
While much of the world's focus on the Middle East centers on rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the Syrian government and its Russian allies have intensified airstrikes on Idlib and the surrounding areas in a monthslong campaign to recapture the territory, upending lives and leaving residents wondering where else they can go, eight years into a brutal war.
On Friday, airstrikes hit several cities in Idlib, killing 10 people, according to the White Helmets, a rescue group operating in opposition-held parts of Syria. Bakeries and residential neighborhoods were targeted as they have been in other recent attacks, which have also frequently hit hospitals.
Mr. Haraki said he and his wife have put off making any long-term decisions, including to have more children, as they constantly fear having to run for their lives. He and his family have already been uprooted several times since the 2011 uprising that precipitated the conflict.


Large-Scale Immigration Raids Fail to Materialize
Immigration officials carried out small-scale raids over the weekend, kicking off what President Trump had promised would be a broad effort to round up people in the country illegally.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents attempted raids in at least two neighborhoods in New York City on Saturday, according to a person familiar with the matter, a day prior to when the president had said the agency would begin national roundups of people illegally in the U.S.
In New York City, ICE agents went to residences in the Harlem section of Manhattan and Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, the person said. The agents were rejected by people at the residences because they didn't have warrants, according to the person. New York City officials said Sunday there was no indication that they had returned.
A spokeswoman for ICE in New York said that the agency won't offer specific details related to enforcement operations. "As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security," the spokeswoman said.
But there was no indication those raids were part of the nationwide roundup Mr. Trump had told reporters would happen beginning Sunday. Mr. Trump had announced a similar raid last month, but it was postponed amid concerns, including over officers' safety. Some Democratic critics of the president said he was using the threat of raids to help consolidate his political base.


Stick to the Public Option, Democrats
Commentators have focused on the aggressive health-care agendas of Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Yet of the 20 candidates in last month's debates, only four said they favored single payer, or Medicare for All. The rest favored a public option—a better approach.
Most Americans want universal coverage but not a radical change tearing up existing plans. Medicare buy-in for nonelderly Americans is an incremental reform that would improve access and lower costs.
Conservatives argue that Americans would resist any nationalization of health insurance. But the political system has been hospitable to public health insurance for the poor (Medicaid), veterans (Veterans Health Administration), and especially the elderly and the disabled (Medicare). Health-care costs continue to rise faster than inflation, and workers fear losing their employer-based insurance if they change or lose jobs.
In his book "Priced Out: The Economic and Ethical Costs of American Health Care," published posthumously this year, the late Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt (my husband) predicts: "Many Americans may now seek the comfort of permanence that a fully portable, reliable and permanent government-run health insurance plan would offer them, side by side with the possibility of choosing a private health insurance plan instead."
Even aside from its political appeal, a public option could save Americans tens of billions of dollars in health costs each year. The government could use its market power to force down prices. A recent RAND study shows that private insurers pay hospitals much more than Medicare does for the same services.


President of Planned Parenthood Is Ousted
Planned Parenthood Federation of America ousted its president after she had served just eight months, a surprise move that came as the organization faces growing political and legal challenges to abortion rights.
Planned Parenthood, which operates a network of women's health clinics, confirmed the departure Tuesday of Leana Wen.
Dr. Wen became the organization's first physician president in several decades, a move the organization touted at the time as a return to its roots as a health-care provider. She replaced several officials near the top of the organization with people aligned with her health-care focused mission.
In a statement, Dr. Wen said she had significant philosophical differences with the leaders of the organization's board. "I believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one," she said in the statement.
Planned Parenthood's board, which made the decision at a meeting Tuesday, expressed concern about Dr. Wen's leadership style, according to a person familiar with the situation.


Nationalism Doesn't Fit the American Nation
Suddenly, it seems, nationalism is being discussed everywhere, as in the conference on "national conservatism" I attended this week in Washington. The term is used to explain, and often to justify, the success of the Brexit referendum in the U.K., the election of Donald Trump in the U.S., and increasing skepticism about international institutions and norms throughout the West.
Nationalism, proponents argue, has nothing to do with aggression against others. Instead it points inward, to the desire of every nation to be left alone and govern itself in accordance with its own traditions, says Yoram Hazony, a leading theorist of nationalism. Many nationalists condemn universal principles of political right for supposedly undermining sovereignty and justifying imperial interventions.
Nationalism is often conflated with patriotism, which simply means love of country. But nationalism rests on the idea of the "nation," a term derived from the Latin word for "birth." A nation is a distinctive collection of human beings connected by shared characteristics and mutual sympathies, and often by their belief—however doubtful—in common descent.
Nationalism is connected to political sovereignty through a compound idea—the nation-state. In this theory, each state is the political representative of a single nation, and the perimeter of the nation corresponds to the boundary of the state.
In practice, this ideal generates two opposed difficulties. First, some members of the nation may be outside the sovereign state that represents their collective identity. Treaties signed after World War I left millions of Germans and Hungarians beyond the boundaries of their respective nation-states, and the demand to overcome this separation has had reverberations down to the present day. Hitler's demand that Czechoslovakia yield the Sudetenland to the Third Reich was a critical step on the road to World War II. Today, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán does not hesitate to speak for the Hungarians in what is now Romanian Transylvania—or to lecture them on the political course they should follow.


Neil Armstrong's 'Small Step' Brought the Moon Down to Earth
The full moon rose only a few nights ago. I watched it in rural upstate New York. At the instant the moon appeared, the coyotes that den among rocks on a neighboring farm commenced to howl and sing. Clouds gathered in the darkening southern sky, and the moon climbed up among them—the clouds moving as slowly and imperceptibly as the moon, and coalescing, I noticed, in the shape of a crocodile. The moon's light cast a nacreous luster, like the light you see on the inside of oyster shells.
Moonrise, the most elegant ceremony in the heavens, is the monthly ancient dream. Here I am, the moon announces, the Expected One.
The coyotes went silent after their first outburst. Fireflies blinked in the humid summer night. Mosquitoes came to us to claim their drop of blood.
Then the clouds cleared away, except for the crocodile's head. And the full moon, with impassive serenity, ascended, like a great communion wafer, into the cloud crocodile's jaws.
The moon for eons was a distant, mystic object and a metaphor—a favorite of Shakespeare's, as in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" or Cleopatra's "visiting moon." It was the force that caused the tides to surge and heave, and the Earth to bulge, like a child's iridescent soap bubble drawn swiftly through the air; it was the mysterious presence that caused lunatics in psychiatric wards—the "moon mad"—to grow crazier, so that nurses worked double shifts. The moon was Earth's calendar and measured out months as history cycled along through time. Time is, in part, the moon's invention. Its enigmatic brilliance and regularity called forth a pagan reverence. The moon was primordial and mysterious—intimate to women's physiology and their life force. It became a romantic and a sentimental totem, the objective correlative of love.


The Bipartisan Spending Party
The rap on Washington is that it's too partisan and accomplishes little. We'll take that if the alternative is this week's budget deal that is a win for the political faction that really runs the place—the bipartisan spending party.
The deal announced Monday between the White House and leaders in Congress blows past the spending caps of the 2011 Budget Control Act by $320 billion in 2020 and 2021, and kills the caps thereafter. The budget act was supposed to enforce fiscal discipline, but it has devolved into a bipartisan trade in which Democrats get more on domestic accounts in return for giving Republicans more on defense. Everybody's happy except the future taxpayers who will pay for it.
The good news—the only good news—is that the deal continues the Trump Administration's modest defense buildup. The U.S. military was degraded in the Obama years by reduced and unpredictable funding.
The deal lifts the cap on defense spending to $738 billion in 2020 from $716 billion this year, and in 2021 the Pentagon will receive $740.5 billion. Several years in a row of predictable, higher funding will allow the Pentagon to improve the readiness of fighter squadrons, build a few more ships, improve missile defenses and invest in technology—all necessary for maintaining the military's competitive edge.
The price Democrats extorted for essential national security is another two-year blowout in domestic accounts. Domestic discretionary spending will increase to $632 billion in 2020 from $605 billion in 2019 and hit $634.5 billion in 2021. That's in addition to the entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid that will grow 4% or more as they always do.


New York's Public Housing Misery
Democrats claim that affordable housing is a basic human right, and the 2020 presidential candidates disagree mainly on how many more tens of billions to spend. How about first creating affordable housing that isn't a human-rights violation, a la a new report on the New York City Housing Authority?
Rats, roaches, mold and leaks have long abounded at the nation's largest public housing authority with some 174,000 apartments. "Elevators often fail, leaving elderly or disabled residents trapped in their apartments or sleeping in building lobbies because they cannot return to their homes," the feds reported in a 2018 complaint against Nycha. The housing authority narrowly escaped federal takeover, agreeing to a settlement in January that includes a new federal monitor to supervise its overhaul.
Monitor Bart Schwartz filed his first quarterly report Monday, and it would embarrass Mayor Bill de Blasio if he were embarrassable. Housing and Urban Development gives Nycha some $30 million a week for day-to-day operations, but this is often squandered. Mr. Schwartz describes "an organization fraught with serious problems in structure, culture, and direction" and a "tendency to avoid personal responsibility and accountability."
Waste and inefficiency abound. Billions of dollars in roofing, windows, doors and other infrastructure are likely subject to warranties that would cover the cost of repairs or replacements "at no additional expense to Nycha." But the housing authority hasn't sufficiently kept track of them, so taxpayers cover the costs—or the repair never gets done.
Nycha often brags about the number of work orders closed as "a measure of productivity and success," but Mr. Schwartz reports that "often there is little, if any, correlation between closing work orders and completing the repair of a problem." Mr. Schwartz says Nycha's data "is often incomplete, imprecise, and/or inaccessible, creating an inaccurate perception" of its performance.


Alleged 9/11 Mastermind Open to Helping Victims' Lawsuit if U.S. Drops Death Penalty
WASHINGTON—Alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has opened the door to helping victims of the terrorist attacks in their lawsuit against Saudi Arabia if the U.S. government spares him the death penalty at a Guantanamo Bay military commission, according to court documents.
Mohammed's offer was disclosed in a Friday filing in the victims' federal lawsuit in New York, which accuses the Saudi government of helping coordinate the 2001 suicide attacks. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when terrorists crashed hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and, after passengers resisted, a Pennsylvania field. Riyadh has denied complicity in the attacks.
Separately, President Trump signed legislation Monday that pays for medical claims from victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including first responders, for the rest of their lives.
In the lawsuit against Saudi Arabia, plaintiffs' lawyers had requested depositions from three of the five Guantanamo detainees accused in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. In the Friday filing, a status letter to U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, the lawyers wrote that earlier Friday, Mohammed's counsel told them their client wouldn't consent to a deposition "at the present time."
Mohammed's lawyer said, however, that "the primary driver" of the decision was the "capital nature of the prosecution" and that "[i]n the absence of a potential death sentence much broader cooperation would be possible," according to the filing.


New York State Bill Would Make Dousing a Police Officer a Felony
New York state Republican lawmakers unveiled a bill Wednesday that would make throwing water on police officers a felony punishable by up to four years in prison.
State Assemblyman Michael Reilly, who is from Staten Island and a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the police soakings should be stopped before someone gets hurt.
"It's only a matter of time until we see that someone is throwing something more that water," said Mr. Reilly, who is a former New York Police Department officer. "It's going to be gasoline or lye, or bleach."
The proposed measure was announced a day after NYPD officials launched a probe into the July 24 dousing of two officers in Queens. The NYPD already had been investigating the dousing of two officers in Brooklyn on July 20 and one in Harlem on July 21.
Investigators arrested one man in the July 20 incident, accusing him of dumping a bucket of water on an officer. Courtney Thompson faces misdemeanor charges for criminal nuisance and obstruction of governmental administration, as well as a felony charge for criminal mischief, stemming from damage to the officer's body camera.


Joshua Harris Kisses Christianity Goodbye
Not all those who wander are lost, J.R.R. Tolkien observed. The corollary is that not all who lead know where they're going. Both these statements are true of Joshua Harris, the former pastor and author of "I Kissed Dating Goodbye" (1997), who acknowledged on Instagram last week that "by all the measurements that I have for defining a Christian, I am not a Christian."
Mr. Harris's announcement carried strange poignancy for millennials who grew up in evangelical churches. In the 1990s, when they were teens, the mood was countercultural. Parents pondered their disillusion with the sexual revolution and observed the high rate of teen pregnancy and the AIDS epidemic. Dads attended Promise Keepers, moms considered home schooling, and both urged their kids to save sex for marriage.
The Purity Movement, also known as the True Love Waits Movement, caught on. In July 1994, some 210,000 teenagers gathered on the National Mall in Washington to sign virginity pledges. Others made the same vow at church youth groups and home-school conferences.
Mr. Harris, son of a prominent Christian home-school advocate, took the idea to its extreme. "I believe that the fundamental problem with relationships today is that we've disconnected romance and commitment," Mr. Harris, then 22, argued in "I Kissed Dating Goodbye." In his view, intimacy wasn't just about sex. The risk of dating before marriage was emotional promiscuity, even if the relationship never got physical, he argued. "Intimacy without commitment, like icing without cake, can be sweet, but it ends up making us sick," he wrote.
Mr. Harris imagined a bride watching her groom walk down the aisle, accompanied by all of his ex-girlfriends. Teens at purity conferences were given a paper heart, then told to rip it in half for each past relationship. What remained was all they had left to offer. Or they were compared with a piece of gum: Would you want to chew it after someone else already has?


Israeli Jets Appear to Have Struck Iraq for the First Time Since 1981
Two airstrikes on Shiite militia targets took place in Iraq last month. No country or organization has taken responsibility, but there are strong reasons to think they were carried out by Israel. If so, these would be the Jewish state's first air raids on Iraq since the destruction of Saddam Hussein's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981.
The first of the raids, on July 19, targeted a militia base near the town of Amerli in Salah al-Din province, north of Baghdad. The second, three days later, struck Camp Ashraf, a former U.S. military base in Iraq's Diyala Province. Both the Ashraf and Amerli bases are now controlled by the Badr Organization, a Shiite militia cum political party, in apparent cooperation with Iran.
According to Arabic media reports, the second raid was of considerably larger dimensions than the first. Al-Ain, the Emirati news website that broke the news of the Camp Ashraf action, reported about 40 dead Iranian Revolutionary Guard personnel and Iraqi Shiite militiamen.
The Saudi Sharq al Awsat newspaper last week attributed the attacks to Israel. Officials in Jerusalem have remained silent, but their country is the only serious candidate. The only other main enemies of the Shiite militias in Iraq are Islamic State and the U.S. and its coalition. The former lacks the capacity to mount air raids. The latter are engaged in high-stakes diplomacy intended to force an Iranian climbdown on the nuclear issue while avoiding a further deterioration in the relationship; open conflict is the last thing the U.S. and its allies want right now. That leaves Israel.
This is almost certainly not Israel's first strike on Iraqi Shiite militias, which have been vital both to the advance of Iranian power in Iraq and to Tehran's defense of the Assad regime in Syria. According to U.S. security sources quoted by the Journal, in June 2018 Israel bombed a facility that housed members of the Kata'ib Hezbollah militia and Iran's Revolutionary Guards near Abu Kamal, a town in southwest Syria, near the Iraqi border. The raid was intended to prevent the transfer of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.


El Paso Murder Spree Renews Spotlight on 8chan Online Forum
The man suspected of killing 20 people and injuring 26 more in a shooting rampage at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, allegedly posted a hate-filled manifesto on the same fringe online message board used earlier this year by the suspect in the Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque massacre.
The message board, known as 8chan, was founded in 2013 as a no-holds-barred bastion of unconstrained speech devoted to critiquing what its creator saw as the dominance of left-wing views in culture and politics. It is available on the open internet, though it is often blocked by corporate firewalls and isn't indexed by Google's search engine.
Authorities on Sunday said they were looking into the shooting as a possible case of domestic terrorism.
Pressure on 8chan mounted late Sunday after Cloudflare, which provided some of the internet infrastructure for 8chan, said it would withdraw its support for the site. Cloudflare's technology helps websites protect themselves from the floods of hacker traffic that can knock sites offline in so-called denial of service attacks.
Cloudflare has faced criticism for its willingness to support websites promoting any content or mission, including those run by neo-Nazis. Cloudflare has previously said it wasn't its duty to police content, though in 2017, it made a notable exception by ceasing service to the Daily Stormer, a bulletin board for self-proclaimed white supremacists, after the site began claiming that Cloudflare secretly supported its ideology.


American Decline? We've Been Here Before
After two decades of relentless setbacks abroad, it's time to ask whether the decline in American influence is irreversible.
Since the turn of the century, even America's apparent successes have turned sour. Afghanistan and Iraq became quagmires. Al Qaeda metastasized in new forms throughout the Muslim world. Russia and China became more hostile. The Arab Spring turned quickly to winter. Democracy everywhere encountered new headwinds. The Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and the Trans-Pacific Partnership were concluded, then rejected. An ever-growing number of books and articles bemoan the demise of the liberal world order, the erosion of democracy, and the end of the American century.
The Trump administration's response can be characterized as "no more Mr. Nice Guy." This view holds that while the U.S. has been busy propping up the international order and safeguarding the global commons, its friends and adversaries have been taking unfair advantage by encroaching on American markets and free-riding on American security guarantees. The time has come, it's argued, to renegotiate America's most solemn undertakings, those underpinning both the global trading system and the Western security architecture—and withdraw from them if better deals cannot be struck.
The response from the left is less belligerent and less unilateral, but it shares President Trump's aversion to further trade liberalization and foreign security entanglements.
The most fully articulated version of this approach comes from self-described realist writers on the left or the libertarian right who call for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from overseas locations including Europe, East Asia and the Middle East, advocating a strategy of "offshore balancing," or relying on regional allies to check the rise of hostile powers, rather than forward defense.


Colombia Grants Citizenship to Babies Born to Venezuelan Refugees
BOGOTÁ, Colombia—President Ivan Duque's government is granting citizenship to more than 24,000 children born here to Venezuelan refugees and considered stateless, providing relief to anguished parents who had fled economic calamity in Venezuela but worried about accessing services in their new home.
"This is such good news," said Mariela Martiarena, 31 years old, whose 10-month-old daughter, Isabella, was born here in Bogotá after she and her husband, David Hernandez, had fled the Venezuelan capital. "I think this is very good because this is the best for her. She needs everything, like health care. She needs it for her future."
About 1.4 million of the estimated four million Venezuelans who have fled their country have wound up here in Colombia, which shares a long border with Venezuela and has received more Venezuelans than anywhere else. Hundreds of thousands of them settled here without papers, and Colombian government officials and international aid organizations expect many more as Venezuela's economy continues to disintegrate.
Until now, the babies born to Venezuelans who are undocumented—and to those on temporary visas that permit a two-year stay—had been unable to obtain Colombian citizenship. Because Venezuela's authoritarian government no longer operates consular services in Colombia, new parents couldn't register their newborns as Venezuelans, either.
Those babies, until now, have officially been citizens of no country.


Portrait of Dayton Shooter: 'Uncontrollable Urges' and Violent Talk Couched as Jokes
DAYTON, Ohio—Caitlyn Johnson dated Connor Betts for several months until she broke up with him in May because she found his interest in mass shooting and other behaviors disturbing, she said.
"I started to get uneasy when he called me drunk and was talking about wanting to hurt people," the 24-year-old college student said, adding that she urged him to get help but could only do so much.
Early Sunday morning, Betts killed nine people including his own 22-year-old sister, and injured more than two dozen others in a 30-second burst of gunfire before he was killed by police.
Ms. Johnson said she didn't alert authorities because she didn't want to believe he was capable of hurting others.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday it was launching its own probe into the shooting focusing on violent ideologies that the shooter had been exploring before the attack.


Some Senior Voters Waver on Trump as 2020 Campaign Picks Up
The fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate is seniors. They supported President Trump in 2016 but aren't squarely in his camp as the 2020 campaign picks up.
In 2016, despite polling showing an advantage for Democrat Hillary Clinton, voters over 65 backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election by a 52%-45% margin, according to exit polls. With still more than a year before next year's election, 41% of seniors in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in June said they would prefer to see Mr. Trump re-elected, while 48% favored a generic Democrat to win in 2020. That comes as 46% of seniors said they approve of Mr. Trump's performance in office, slightly higher than his 44% overall approval rating.
Among 18-to-34 year-olds, Mr. Trump's approval rating is just 33%, the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows, and Democratic candidates have paid great attention to young voters this cycle, announcing support for plans like student-debt forgiveness. But the fastest-growing generation of voters isn't millennials, it is seniors. Voters over age 65 are projected to make up nearly a quarter of the electorate in 2020, the highest such share since 1970, according to the Pew Research Center.
"Given the antipathy that younger voters have toward [Trump], he really needs support among seniors to reach at least the support he received in 2016," said Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster with Hart Research Associates who helps conduct Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls.
Seniors are the likeliest to actually cast ballots, with two-thirds of them voting in the 2018 midterms compared with 53% of the overall voting-age population. While the electorate in presidential years skews younger than in midterm ones, no Democratic presidential candidate has won seniors since Al Gore in 2000, and for the past five presidential-election cycles, every Republican nominee has won a larger share of seniors than his predecessor.


New York City Considers Lifting Hostel Ban
New York City could legalize hostels under a bill set to be introduced this week in the city council, the second attempt to reauthorize the budget hotels after a state law made them illegal.
Councilman Mark Gjonaj and Councilwoman Margaret Chin are co-sponsors of the bill, which would give hostels their own department and classification in the city.
Hostels diminished in New York City after a 2010 state law changed the city's multiple dwelling rules. The law was meant to curb illegal hotels—especially illegal Airbnb rentals, which later saw more regulation through a city council bill passed last year.
But that earlier measure also restricted hostels, known for dormlike accommodations and favored by younger travelers looking for a cheaper stay, the lawmakers said. Hostels were never clearly defined in the city's building codes and, before the ban, were subject to the same rules as apartments. Although a handful of hostels still operate legally around the city, they are limited.
Mr. Gjonaj, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx, said the lack of more affordable options makes the city less accessible to some tourists. The bill would standardize hostels and allow more to be built, he said.


The Flash Mobs of Hong Kong
Hong Kong
I heard tear gas was filling the air and Molotov cocktails were flying, so I rushed to the scene. By the time I arrived in the Wan Chai commercial district Sunday night, demonstrators were retreating into the metro station. I followed them onto the train that took them to the next protest.
When Hong Kong's protests began in June in response to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland, they were orderly, scheduled and well-attended. Turnout twice exceeded a million. But as police have responded more violently, protesters changed tactics. Smaller groups rally at spur-of-the-moment demonstrations organized by word-of-mouth, on the Telegram messaging app, or on the LIHKG online forum.
The movement is leaderless. "There is a variety of opinions and different people thinking of different strategies," says Isaac Cheng, a protester who is also vice chairman of the pro-democracy party Demosistō. "Each person participating in the crowd can express their opinions and change the movement" by making a persuasive case.
The "flash mob" protests make their statement, sometimes damage government property, and disappear—with any luck, avoiding injuries and arrests. Nonetheless, participating is risky.


FDA Approves New Pill for Drug-Resistant TB
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to help treat deadly, drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, the world's biggest infectious-disease killer.
The drug, called Pretomanid, was greenlighted Wednesday for use in combination with two existing pills to treat the airborne disease.
Tuberculosis, or TB, is spread by droplets that are sneezed or coughed by someone infected and typically attacks the lungs and then other parts of the body, if not treated. Like other bacterial infections, TB must be treated with a cocktail of drugs, rather than a single therapy, to prevent the microbes from developing resistance and roaring back.
About 10 million people globally developed TB in 2017, and of them, about 558,000 had a form that was resistant to at least one TB drug, according to the World Health Organization. An estimated 1.6 million died of the disease in 2017.
Developing new, more effective treatments has been a priority of public-health authorities alarmed by the rise of versions resistant to current antibiotics. One barrier has been a lack of interest from many for-profit drugmakers, partly because of the limited commercial market for such drugs.


Iran-Aligned Houthis Strike Major Saudi Oil Field
Yemen's Houthi rebels struck Saudi Arabia's Shaybah oil field, one of the kingdom's largest, Saudi officials and the Houthis said, deepening tensions between Iran and its rivals that have engulfed the region's energy facilities.
The Houthis said in a statement Saturday that they had targeted Shaybah with 10 drones. The Iran-aligned rebels said the attack was their largest of its kind on Saudi Arabia, which they have been fighting for control in Yemen since 2014.
The Saudi oil ministry confirmed what it called a terrorist attack on Shaybah, which is owned by Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco, and holds about 14 billion barrels of oil reserves. A military spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen didn't respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, Aramco said it had controlled a fire at a natural gas production facility at Shaybah. The company said there were no injuries and no disruption to the field's production of about 1 million barrels a day.
A Saudi oil official and an Aramco executive said the Houthis were exaggerating its size.


Justice Department Drops Foreign Bribery Probe Into Medical Device Maker
The U.S. Justice Department has closed a foreign bribery investigation into medical device maker Misonix Inc.'s former distributor in China, the company said.
The Farmingdale, N.Y.-based manufacturer of ultrasonic medical devices received a letter from the Justice Department last week saying there won't be any enforcement action in connection with its China business, the company said in a securities filing made last Friday.
The decision follows a separate move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June to end its own foreign bribery probe into the company. The investigations came to a close nearly three years after Misonix voluntarily alerted U.S. authorities to potential issues at its business in China, illustrating how long it can take for the government to decide whether a matter warrants an enforcement action. The matter under scrutiny was related to the business practices of an independent Chinese entity that previously distributed Misonix's products, according to its filing. Misonix cooperated with the government in their parallel investigations, the company said. Misonix didn't respond to a request for further comment. Write to Dylan Tokar at 


China Resists Charge by Twitter, Facebook of Disinformation Effort
China's government pushed back against moves by Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. to curb accounts the companies said were part of a state-sponsored disinformation campaign against Hong Kong protesters, saying the posts were simply Chinese citizens overseas expressing their views.
These citizens, including students, "have the rights to express their opinions and viewpoints," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said a regularly schedule press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.
China has been closely monitoring political unrest in Hong Kong where pro-democracy protesters have demonstrated for more than two months after Hong Kong's government introduced a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The Hong Kong government in June shelved the bill but protesters have persisted, demanding the bill be dropped, an inquiry into police conduct against protesters and other requests. China has repeatedly criticized the protestsand suggested it could deploy its own security forces, and even its military, to restore order in the semiautonomous Chinese city if local officials can't manage it themselves.
Twitter on Monday said it took down 936 accounts linked to a "significant state-backed information operation" originating in China. "These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground," Twitter wrote in a blog post.
Facebook said that following a tip from Twitter, it removed five accounts along with seven pages, with a reach of more than 15,000 accounts, as well as three groups that included more than 2,000 members. "Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government," Facebook said on Monday.


China Threatens Sanctions Over Planned U.S. Sale of Jets to Taiwan
BEIJING—China said it would sanction any U.S. firm involved in a planned $8 billion sale of advanced jet fighters to Taiwan, in retaliation against what it describes as Washington's attempt to undermine Chinese national security.
Beijing's countermeasure against the proposed sale of 66 F-16V fighters isn't expected to have much impact on the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin Corp. , but it could complicate efforts to resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute.
"China will take all necessary measures to safeguard its interests, including the imposition of sanctions against the American companies that participate in this arms sale to Taiwan," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday.
Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan as part of its territory and refuses to rule out achieving unification by force. China repeatedly has criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as harmful to its sovereignty.
If Washington goes through with the F-16V sale, all of the ensuing consequences must be borne by the U.S., Mr. Geng said, without elaborating.


Arun Jaitley, a Confidant of India's Modi, Dies at 66
NEW DELHI—India's former finance minister, Arun Jaitley, who was one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's closest aides, died Saturday after a prolonged illness. He was 66.
Mr. Jaitley had health problems over the past five years. He had weight-loss surgery in 2014 and a kidney transplant last year. Early this year, he developed serious health conditions and flew to the U.S. for treatment.
He was admitted to the New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Aug. 9 after he complained of breathlessness.
"It is with profound grief that we inform about the sad demise of Arun Jaitley at 12:07 pm on 24th August, 2019," the hospital said Saturday.
Mr. Jaitley held the portfolios of finance and corporate affairs in the first five-year term of Mr. Modi's government from 2014. He was also a minister for defense and information and broadcasting, briefly.


Iran's President Won't Meet Trump Unless the U.S. Lifts Sanctions
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani rejected the possibility of meeting with President Trump as long as the U.S. sanctioned his country, a day after both leaders appeared to be opening up to possible talks following months of heightened tensions.
The Iranian leader's return to his default position illustrates the pressure he faces at home from hard-line factions opposed to talking to the Trump administration and the challenges of resolving the crisis between the U.S. and Iran.
"We seek to resolve the issues and solve the problems in a reasonable way. But we don't seek photos," Mr. Rouhani said in a televised speech Tuesday. "If you lifted all the sanctions, bowed respectfully to the Iranian nation, well then the conditions are different."
Mr. Rouhani said Monday he would meet with "anyone" if it served his country's interest, departing from months of rejections of any talks and raising hopes of a possible thaw. President Trump indicated he would be open to meeting with his Iranian counterpart, in what would be the first meeting between the leaders of the two countries since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
"If the circumstances were correct or right, I would certainly agree to that," Mr. Trump told reporters at the Group of Seven summit in France.


No Sign Venezuela's Maduro Willing to Exit, U.S. Says
WASHINGTON—The top U.S. envoy for Venezuela said there has been no sign that the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, was willing to negotiate an exit deal, the Trump administration's most direct acknowledgment yet that U.S. efforts to force a change in government have stalled.
The comment by envoy Elliott Abrams followed disclosures about secret talks between the U.S. and top officials of the Maduro regime as part of the U.S. push to replace Mr. Maduro with opposition leader Juan Guaidó, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Abrams said that the U.S. regularly communicates with the Maduro government but that the two sides aren't involved in a negotiation about Mr. Maduro's departure.
"I have to say, I have not yet seen any sign of a willingness to negotiate that kind of compromise, which is of course very unfortunate," Mr. Abrams told reporters, adding that an exit was the only possible solution to the crisis.
Administration officials have held talks involving Venezuelan officials including Maduro lieutenant Diosdado Cabello, who heads the country's National Constituent Assembly and has been sanctioned by Washington for drug trafficking, the Journal reported.


The Free Spirits of Burning Man Meet the Man
Pershing County, Nev.
Desert dust obscures the road. When it clears for a moment, strange revelers come into view. They wear fluorescent tutus, boots, sequins and faux fur. "Welcome home!" a security volunteer bellows, offering newcomers a hug and a hearty roll in the sand.
Along with about 80,000 others, I made the pilgrimage this week to the annual pop-up city in the middle of Nevada's Black Rock Desert. Burning Man—now in its third decade—isn't "a festival," organizers insist. "It is an event, a community and a global cultural movement." Whatever it is, Burning Man adds some $63 million a year to the Nevada economy, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.
Burning Man has a reputation for anarchism. But the event occurs on federal land, so its organizers have grown skilled at navigating government bureaucracy. Interior's Bureau of Land Management ultimately approves the permit every year, but more than a dozen other federal, state, county and tribal regulators also have their eyes on the event.
Environmental concerns are paramount. Burning Man prides itself on being a "leave no trace" experience. Attendees are expected to haul off their own garbage, down to the last pistachio shell and sequin. BLM demands that no more than a single square foot of debris per acre be left behind, and "they've done an excellent job of meeting that criterion," says Rudy Evenson, a BLM spokesman in Nevada.


Cease-Fire in Syria Holds, Bringing Relief to Last Rebel Holdout
BEIRUT—A fragile cease-fire in northwest Syria held Monday, months after the United Nations warned of a humanitarian crisis developing in the last rebel stronghold fighting against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
Russia declared the unilateral cease-fire in Idlib province on Friday and it went into effect Saturday morning. The province has suffered daily airstrikes since the end of April as the regime of President Basha al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, attempts to retake the province and reassert control over the entire country after eight years of conflict.
The province is home to about three million people, half of whom have been displaced from elsewhere in Syria. Aircraft have regularly fired missiles and dropped barrel bombs on the province, targeting civilian areas including hospitals and schools, according to the nonprofit Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations
Some civilians took advantage of the rare lull in violence, worried that the cease-fire would soon collapse.
"We came to the town because there is no way we can come here when the airstrikes are happening," said Obeida Omar, a local resident who went back to his house in a town close to the front lines to pick up some of his children's clothes. He has been living with his family of four in nearby groves to escape the airstrikes.


The National Battle for Redistricting
To the degree Americans are following politics right now, the presidential contest draws their attention. But the Democratic primary isn't the only race that matters. Many politicos in both parties are keenly focused on the bottom of the ballot. Democrats and Republicans will spend tens of millions on a handful of state legislative seats in 16 states for one main reason: congressional redistricting.
As required by the Constitution, the federal government will conduct the census in 2020. Then it will reapportion the House, taking seats from states whose populations haven't kept pace and transferring them to those that are rapidly growing. In 2021 states must draw new lines for congressional and state legislative districts for the next decade.
In 2010, aided by President Obama's unpopularity, the GOP picked up 720 state legislative seats and took over 20 additional state legislative chambers. Combined with a wave of gubernatorial victories, this put the GOP in control of redistricting in states with a combined majority of U.S. House seats.
The Democratic Party was caught napping in 2010 by the GOP, whose efforts were driven by Ed Gillespie at the Republican State Leadership Committee. Wanting to avoid a repeat in 2020, former Attorney General Eric Holder formed the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2016. While Mr. Holder says he's working for a fair drawing of district lines, when his organization filed for nonprofit status it told the IRS its goal was to "favorably position Democrats for the redistricting process." Mr. Obama has thrown in with his former attorney general, rolling his personal political committee, Organizing for America, into Mr. Holder's NDRC.
Nearly $90 million in spending from national groups helped the Democrats pick up eight chambers in 2018, all in states with Democratic governors. But this was a middling performance. The nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 12 chambers change partisan control in an average election.


Texas Governor Seeks to Plug Law Enforcement Holes After Mass Shootings
AUSTIN, Texas—Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued eight executive orders Thursday in response to a pair of recent mass shootings, while resisting legislative Democrats' calls for a special session to consider new gun legislation.
The orders by Mr. Abbott, a Republican, call for the Texas Department of Public Safety to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to better assess threats and share information more effectively. Mr. Abbott ordered DPS to develop questions to better identify when a person calling should be reported as suspicious, to create regional "threat assessment teams," and to mandate training and public outreach on reporting potentially dangerous people. The orders also make future law-enforcement grants to counties contingent on them reporting at least 90% of criminal convictions to DPS.
The effort to close what an announcement referred to as "information gaps" comes after a shooter who killed seven in the West Texas towns of Midland and Odessa on Saturday first called local and federal authorities before his rampage, expressing anger about having lost his job and other issues.
The mother of the shooter who killed 22 people in El Paso last month had previously called police to express concerns about a firearm her son had bought.
"Texas must achieve several objectives to better protect our communities and our residents from mass shootings," Mr. Abbott said in a statement. "One of those objectives is to marshal law enforcement resources to stop violent criminals before they commit mass murders. But more must be done."


Can the Climate Cause Survive the Democratic Primaries?
Conservatives have often suspected that radical environmentalism is simply a vehicle to expand government. Democratic presidential candidates seem eager to confirm it.
Campaigning against everything from plastic straws to cheeseburgers at CNN's Wednesday night "Climate Crisis Town Hall," the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination agreed that to avoid a climate catastrophe they're willing to do almost anything—except support a proven zero-emission energy source.
Former Vice President Joe Biden called climate change "an existential threat" and spoke at length about his $1.7 trillion plan to move America to "net zero emissions." But he never mentioned nuclear power, which produces zero emissions.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), who promotes a $10 trillion plan, promised to do "whatever is necessary" to address the climate "emergency." But when asked about zero-emission nuclear power, which has operated safely in the U.S. for decades, she expressed only reservations. Sen. Harris said she opposed a federal nuclear waste facility in Nevada because the state's politicians don't like it.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said, "Life on Earth is at risk." She warned that the alternative to a massive effort to reduce U.S. emissions by 70% is "unthinkable' and "morally wrong." But she too was quick to rule out the most obvious solution to the alleged crisis. Here's part of the transcript of her appearance with CNN's Chris Cuomo:


Bahamas Officials Struggle to Coordinate Recovery from Massive Hit by Dorian
Days after Hurricane Dorian deluged the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama with rain and massive storm surges, the logistical challenges of getting aid where it is needed are staggering, a top health official in the Bahamas said.
"The level of damage is so intense that it's almost difficult to conceptualize what force or convergence of forces could have led to the shattering, the splintering of buildings of stone, of concrete and wood," Duane Sands, minister of health in the Bahamas, said in an interview Sunday.
Local air-traffic controllers are struggling to coordinate 600 humanitarian aid flights into Abaco a day, he said. There is only one working ambulance on Grand Bahama, floodwaters severely damaged the Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport, and local nurses and physicians are among those who have lost their homes and loved ones, the minister said. Meanwhile, vehicles capable of moving supplies to victims are in short supply, even when roads to affected areas are passable.
To date, 44 deaths in the Bahamas have been attributed to Dorian, the strongest hurricane on modern record to hit the northwestern Bahamas. Officials expect that number to rise significantly as search-and-recovery teams make their way through the rubble on Abaco and Grand Bahama.
"The human loss of life could be staggering or unimaginable," Mr. Sands said. "This is our Katrina moment."


Notable & Quotable: Call Sign Chaos
From "Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead" (Random House) by Jim Mattis and Bing West:
Policies can change based on political goals established by our elected leaders. Yet those goals must remain realistic and coherent if they are to enable an achievable strategy. Any war, even a war of limited political ends, must be fully resourced for its mission. Acting strategically requires that political leaders make clear what they will stand for and what they will not stand for. We must mean what we say, to both allies and foes: no more false threats or failing to live up to our word. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, the decision of going to war is too great a matter to stumble into or to half-step toward once the decision is taken.


How Myanmar's Military Duped the West
Yangon, Myanmar
Is the American foreign-policy community wise enough, disciplined enough, and knowledgeable enough about Asia to build an effective coalition to balance a rising China? The example of Myanmar is a worrying one.
Myanmar received extraordinary attention from the last administration, with visits from both Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama. But the crucial Southeast Asian country turned out not to be the human-rights miracle many in both parties envisioned. And when events in Myanmar failed to follow the idealistic script written in Washington, the U.S. responded in ways that undermined the country's reformers, empowered its military and strengthened China's hand. The U.S. failed even to demonstrate a balanced approach to human rights the people of Myanmar might have respected.
In the early years of the Obama administration, many Americans fell in love with a fantasy: the idea that Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese political leader who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and endured 15 years of house arrest, was in the process of taking power from a defeated military junta. They misread the situation fundamentally.
In 2010 the military was frustrated. Decades of failed socialist planning had left the economy relatively backward, even as other Asian countries grew rich. Myanmar was largely dependent on Chinese investment, which made the generals nervous. They decided to begin to liberalize their domestic economy to promote faster growth and attract investment from Japan, the U.S. and Europe.


Canada's Trudeau Kicks Off Re-Election Bid in Dead Heat
OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered the start of his campaign toward an Oct. 21 election, in which he will try to overcome damage from an ethics scandal and persuade voters to give the Liberal government another term based on the strength of its economic and environmental record.
Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party enters the campaign in a dead heat with its main rival, the Conservative Party, with support in the low-to-mid 30% range. The Liberal Party won its mandate in 2015 parliamentary elections with 40% of votes cast. At this juncture, neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives appear to have the support required to win a majority of the seats in Canada's Parliament.
Canada has a fixed-election date system, and Mr. Trudeau was required by law to trigger the start of the election campaign no later than Sept. 15 to allow for a minimum number of campaigning days by political leaders.
Mr. Trudeau's popularity has declined markedly this year under the weight of allegations that he and his senior aides tried to interfere in the criminal prosecution of a Montreal engineering company. A probe by Canada's ethics watchdog ruled last month Mr. Trudeau broke rules in trying to steer his then-attorney general away from proceeding with a trial against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Ottawa, Mr. Trudeau, 47 years old, said the election would be a choice between inclusive politics and economic progress under the Liberals and austerity measures under a Conservative government.


Lawmakers Make Long-Shot Bid to Check Presidential Tariff Powers
In Sen. Jerry Moran's home state of Kansas, support for President Trump remains high. But so does anxiety among farmers and manufacturers about the economic fallout from the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed.
"This has gone on longer than I think people expected it," Mr. Moran said. "And so the financial consequences are increasing."
Mr. Moran and some other Republicans—including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee—are searching for ways to team up with Democrats to reassert congressional authority over the levying of tariffs. They aim to curb the type of tariff-by-tweet policy-making that has whipsawed markets and stressed U.S. businesses in recent months.
The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump has said the U.S. has long been taken advantage of by other nations and that tariffs are the best way to make trading partners comply with U.S. demands. Some of his tariff threats have helped the president meet policy goals: Mexico in June agreed to act to reduce the flow of migrants at the U.S. border in exchange for the U.S. suspending planned levies.
Those Republicans who back having more control over tariffs say they aren't attacking Mr. Trump but rather trying to rebalance trade powers between the legislative and executive branches without hampering the president's ability to protect national security.


The '50s Social Contract, Run by White Men
Regarding Barton Swaim's review of Nicholas Lemann's "Transaction Man" (Bookshelf, Sept. 12): It is amusing to see Mr. Lemann and others on the left wax nostalgic about the U.S. economy in the 1950s when privileged, white, male technocrats in government colluded with privileged, white, male CEOs to generously share corporate profits with union employees and Washington tax collectors. The good ol' days ended when countries that were decimated during World War II recovered and their businesses began to clean corporate America's clock. By the 1970s, U.S. corporate leaders had to worry about profit margins, growth and shareholder value, and that is when "transaction man" climbed the ladder to squeeze unions and make money for stockholders.
Anyone not revered by the left who finds something to like about 1950s America is pilloried as a racist and hater. Poor Prof. Amy Wax at the University of Pennsylvania Law School made the mistake a couple of years ago of saying that 1950s bourgeois values had merit. Those values included completing school (college, if possible), getting a job before marriage, getting married before having children and staying away from drugs and crime. She then doubled down on her hateful reference to the 1950s by saying that there is something admirable in American culture relative to other cultures—e.g., individual rights, free markets and fair elections. The left was incensed.
Someone needs to tell Mr. Lemann and Democratic socialists that the 1950s are now calling to ask for their economic policy back because the days of giant, unionized American manufacturers dominating the world have been over for 50 years.

U.S. Sanctions Chinese Firms for Allegedly Shipping Iranian Oil
The Trump administration blacklisted several Chinese companies including units of a state giant for allegedly shipping Iranian oil in violation of U.S. sanctions, attempting to cut off the last vestiges of Iran's crude exports.
The action signaled the administration's commitment to its "maximum pressure" campaign as European allies and other nations push Washington to ease sanctions and cool rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
The move Wednesday hit state-owned companies that collectively represent some of the biggest movers of oil and petroleum products in the world. The action is expected to strain ties further between Washington and Beijing as the two superpowers clash over trade, security and a host of other topics, former U.S. officials warn.
"We're telling China and all nations: Know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in announcing the measures Wednesday on the sidelines of a United Nations summit in New York.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, while not addressing the specific sanctions imposed Wednesday, called the U.S. campaign "merciless economic terrorism" and said his government wouldn't negotiate with the U.S. unless Washington lifted sanctions


New York Attorney General, Brooklyn District Attorney Sue ICE Over Courthouse Arrests
New York Attorney General Letitia James, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez and advocacy groups filed a pair of lawsuits in New York on Wednesday to prevent federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from arresting illegal immigrants who appear in New York courts on unrelated matters.
Ms. James, Mr. Gonzalez and advocates said the presence of ICE in and near courthouses discourages immigrants from appearing in court as witnesses or complainants in crimes or matters of civil litigation and thereby inhibits the legal system and harms public safety.
Some data show ICE actions in New York courthouses have become more frequent. The nonprofit advocacy group Immigrant Defense Project tallied 202 reports of ICE arrests and sightings in New York state courthouses in 2018 compared with 11 in 2016.
ICE spokeswoman Rachael Yong Yow said Wednesday that the agency only rarely makes arrests in courthouses but could provide no data on the number of ICE actions in or around courts.
Ms. James said at a news conference on Wednesday in Manhattan that the presence of ICE in state courthouses has had a negative effect on hundreds of active cases, causing a "major disruption to state court operations."


Democrats Set a Bear Trap
Every time I imagine Elizabeth Warren debating Donald Trump, I picture him rumbling onto the stage like a big white bear—roaring "Grrr grrrr," towering over her, paws flailing, claws extended. She'll stand there looking up at him in the lights, and you'll wonder if she's trembling, cowering, because clearly she's about to be crushed. And then she'll take a brisk step forward and punch him hard and sharp in the kidney. And he'll howl—"Aarrrrggg!"—because he's surprised and it hurts and he assumed he'd easily chase her around the stage.
She'll say, "Mr. President, I know everyone's supposed to be afraid of you and your rough ways, but I don't find you so tough. And I'm not afraid of you." (Transcript: "Applause, cheers.") Then she'll call him soft, corrupt, incompetent—a phony martyr who doesn't respect his own supporters enough to fake respectability.
He'll call her a left-wing nut who'll ruin the economy, destroy capitalism, kill our greatness, steal our private health insurance.
We'll be off. And no one will know where it's going.
That is my impeachment thought: Nobody knows where this is going. The politically obsessed may think they do, but something wild and unpredictable has been let loose. The charges are serious and credible. But America is as divided as it was in 2016, America is still in play, and it's all up for grabs.


Intelligence Chief Joseph Maguire Defends Handling of Whistleblower Document
WASHINGTON—Democrats pressed America's top intelligence official to explain his handling of a politically explosive whistleblower complaint, as lawmakers squared off in the first hearing related to President Trump's July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The three-hour hearing marked the first major investigative move by Democrats since launching a formal impeachment process earlier this week.
Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire faced questions Thursday over the delay in passing along the Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint to Congress, as required by law. The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint Thursday morning shortly before Mr. Maguire testified before the panel.
Mr. Maguire testified that after learning of the whistleblower complaint, which focuses on Mr. Trump's call, he first consulted with the White House to see whether the information was privileged. After that, he said, he consulted with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
"I am not authorized as the director of national intelligence to provide executive privilege information," Mr. Maguire told the House Intelligence Committee, under questioning from panel chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.). "I think it is prudent as a member of the executive branch to check to ensure that in fact it does not" contain privileged material, he said.


Justice Department Got Early Word of Concerns About Trump's Ukraine Call
WASHINGTON—Justice Department officials learned about allegations of impropriety concerning President Trump's July conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart before the formal whistleblower complaint was passed along from the intelligence community, people familiar with the matter said.
The revelation sheds new light on how the administration handled the allegations, which are now driving House Democrats' impeachment probe.
The Justice Department had initially blocked sending the whistleblower report to Congress, but relented this week after a legal dispute and pressure from lawmakers. The report was released to the public Thursday.
New information also emerged Friday about the White House's handling of the records of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a central focus of the whistleblower complaint.
According to the complaint, several U.S. officials told the whistleblower that senior White House officials had "intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call" by moving the transcript to a computer system typically reserved for the most sensitive of American secrets, such as U.S. covert actions in other countries. One White House official described the move as an "abuse of this electronic system" given the lack of sensitive material discussed in the call, according to the complaint.


Hong Kong Deploys Water Cannon as Thousands Rally on Anniversary of Umbrella Movement
HONG KONG—Tens of thousands gathered at the scene of pro-democracy protests five years ago Saturday evening, as part of a series of protests ahead of a mass event on Tuesday to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China.
Saturday's rally also marked the fifth anniversary of the beginning of a mass street occupation called the Umbrella Movement. That 79-day demonstration, which politically awakened many young people driving this summer's protests, saw thousands of young people camp out on highways to call for universal suffrage—but ultimately didn't yield any concessions.
Chanting "Hong Kong people!" and singing "Glory to Hong Kong," demonstrators spray-glued protest posters around Tamar Park, which the local government's complex is built on. Midway through the rally, as pro-democracy figures spoke about the events from 2014, other demonstrators began occupying a nearby road. One group burned a red flag with a hammer and sickle. Police used water cannon filled with stinging agent to clear them, and were later searching people on buses and roads.
Democracy is again on the list of demands of protesters who have regularly taken to the streets since early June, but the city's leader, Carrie Lam, has said discussions about the issue must be undertaken "in an atmosphere that is conducive to mutual trust and understanding, and without further polarizing society."
In response to calls for political reform at Saturday's rally, the city's government said: "the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides," to achieve universal suffrage.


Federal Flood Policies Affect Whole Regions
Walter E. Block notes that Canada has a harsh policy of forced buyouts that requires homeowners in flooded areas to relocate ("U.S. Largess vs. Canadian Cruelty," op-ed, Sept. 19). By contrast, in an area such as the Outer Banks of North Carolina that has been hit by three hurricanes in the last four years, the government offered subsidies to residents who stayed and rebuilt. Mr. Block favors a personal responsibility approach: Homeowners should be free to rebuild after a flood, but then they should be on their own regarding private insurance to protect their properties.
I agree with Mr. Block in principle. In practice, however, his libertarian proposal will spell fiscal disaster worse than a hurricane disaster for many coastal counties. Those counties are heavily dependent on property taxes or taxes on vacation rental income collected from homeowners living closest to the water. If those owners took the money and ran after the next hurricane because future insurance costs will be prohibitively expensive, several county budgets will be deeply underwater. A large percentage of tax revenues come from a small percentage of properties and less affluent homeowners a few miles from the water will be hurt the most by subsequent tax increases or budget cuts. Those who provide services to more affluent residents will also have less money to pay taxes.
A libertarian versus largess approach to flood zones could best be determined by a cost-benefit calculation. I would hate to move after a hurricane, but probably would if future property insurance was unaffordable or unavailable. There will be much collateral damage if many others choose to do the same.

Hatred and Anger Don't Foster a More Civil Society
Thank you for publishing James Panero's harrowing account, "The Two Minutes Hate Comes to New York's Subway" (op-ed, Sept. 28). The young man who cursed Mr. Panero on the subway should look into the mirror and ask himself: Who filled my heart with so much hate, and what did they gain by turning me into a mindless agent of bigotry? Politicians, teachers, activists and media professionals who traffic in hatred and manipulate emotions to encourage such ugly actions should be recognized and held accountable.
Donald Black
New York
James Panero's piece is a mirror image of the same day's piece on "number neighbor" texting. In both situations, young people are disrupting the lives of total strangers to "share" the results on social media. So many thousands of people begging for attention from the universe: Just stop it. Get a life.


In Year of Epic Rains, Draining Reservoirs Has Unintended Consequences
Federal authorities are racing to drain water from swollen reservoirs on the Upper Missouri River to prepare for next year's flood season, inadvertently complicating efforts to shore up badly damaged levees downstream.
Heavy rains over frozen ground last March created record floods that breached dozens of levees in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas.
But rains—and even a huge snowstorm in Montana late last month that could melt before winter sets in—haven't let up. That is forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to keep pushing water through its dams and hampering repairs.
"The dams are still full, the rivers are above flood stage and it's already snowing in Montana," said Mike Crecelius, emergency management director of Fremont County, Iowa, where several of the breaches occurred and the river has remained above flood stage since March. "There's never a dull moment."
This year's extended deluge is now expected to tie 2011 for the most precipitation flowing into the Upper Missouri River watershed, federal officials say, raising questions about the overall system's ability to handle increasingly frequent and large storms.


Reality High Court TV
Americans tired of the 24/7 political theater should tune in to Supreme Court oral arguments that can at turns be entertaining and intellectually rigorous. Consider Monday's debate over whether the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in state courts.
In Ramos v. Louisiana, an inmate convicted in 2016 of murder by a 10-2 split jury challenged the constitutionality of a Louisiana law that allowed convictions with non-unanimous verdicts. Louisiana last year repealed the law for trials going forward, but Oregon still allows non-unanimous convictions.
At issue is the Court's Apodaca v. Oregon (1972) precedent in which four Justices held that the Sixth Amendment right to an "impartial jury" includes a unanimous verdict. Four Justices disagreed, but Justice Lewis Powell in the controlling opinion ruled that unanimous verdicts are guaranteed in federal trials but states can apply their own rules.
Mr. Ramos's lawyer called Apodaca a judicial outlier since the other Bill of Rights have been applied or incorporated to the states. But as Louisiana's Solicitor General argued, the state has relied on the precedent for 50 years.
Justice Samuel Alito trolled the Court's liberals who seemed sympathetic to Mr. Ramos. Last term, he observed, "the majority was lectured pretty sternly in a couple of dissents about the importance of stare decisis and about the impropriety of overruling established rules." (Franchise Tax Board and Knick v. Township of Scott.)


Ukraine Whistleblower May Not Testify In Person
WASHINGTON—Lawyers for the CIA officer whose whistleblower complaint helped ignite an impeachment inquiry into President Trump have asked Congress whether their client could submit testimony in writing instead of appearing in person, according to people familiar with the matter.
The request reflects concerns about whether the whistleblower could testify to Democrats and Republicans without revealing his identity, and fears that doing so would lead to it being publicly leaked, jeopardizing his personal safety. The intelligence committees haven't yet responded to the inquiry about potential written testimony, the people said.
Spokeswomen for the House and Senate intelligence committees didn't respond to requests to comment.
In other developments, House committees sent a subpoena to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, asking him to produce by Oct. 18 documents related to his interactions with Mr. Trump, State Department officials and others.
The committees want information from Mr. Perry about any role he played in conveying Mr. Trump's wishes to Ukraine's president, and matters related to a Ukrainian state-owned energy company.


Vaping-Related Lung Illnesses Jump to 1,299, With 26 Deaths
The number of confirmed and probable cases linked to vaping increased to 1,299, including 26 deaths, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday, as doctors began taking stock of the potential long-term health consequences of the severe lung injuries.
The count of cases rose by 219 from a week ago. They are now spread across 49 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Alaska is the only state without reported cases.
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and Texas confirmed deaths for the first time over the past week.
Doctors and health authorities first connected the pneumonialike illnesses to vaping over the summer. Now, some of the early patients have been out of the hospital for several weeks and started showing up for follow-up appointments.
Recovery has varied among the patients, their doctors say. Many appear to have recovered fully, while others have been slower to bounce back and still have trouble breathing.


Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to Step Down
WASHINGTON—Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leaving his post after months of tension with the White House over its hard-line immigration strategy.
President Trump disclosed the departure of Mr. McAleenan, the third person to hold the role since he took office, via Twitter late Friday. Mr. McAleenan—a lawyer with a background in counterrorism enforcement whose political rise and fall happened quickly—had been on the job since early April, when he was tapped to succeed Kirstjen Nielsen. Prior to his appointment as acting secretary, Mr. McAleenan was serving as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.
Mr. McAleenan made the decision to resign himself and delivered his letter of resignation to the White House on Friday, according to two people briefed on the decision.
He said on Twitter he would "work with the White House and DHS leadership teams on a smooth transition."
"Kevin McAleenan has done an outstanding job as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down. Kevin now, after many years in Government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector," Mr. Trump wrote. "Congratulations Kevin, on a job well done! I will be announcing the new Acting Secretary next week. Many wonderful candidates!"


Four Shot Dead in Apparent Brooklyn Gambling Den
Four people were killed and three wounded Saturday morning when shooting erupted in what appeared to be an illegal gambling den in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York Police Department officials said.
Four adult males were fatally wounded by the gunfire while two men and a woman were also shot and transported for medical treatment with non-life-threatening injuries, police officials said.
NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said at least 15 shots were fired during the early morning altercation at 74 Utica Ave. Two guns have been recovered and detectives were interviewing people from the shooting scene, Mr. Shea said.
"It is not a large location," Mr. Shea said. "We will go where the evidence leads us but it's a little preliminary to make speculation whether it's a dispute, whether it's a gambling dispute, whether it's a robbery."
No arrests had been made. At least 15 people were inside the location at the time of the shooting, Mr. Shea said. Police found cards and dice when they responded to the incident.


Inside Notes Illuminate How Supreme Court Decided Major Cases
The case before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 21, 1989, involved a demonstrator named Gregory "Joey" Johnson, who had been fined $2,000 and sentenced to a year in prison for burning an American flag near Dallas City Hall during the 1984 Republican National Convention.
State law prohibited "desecration of a venerated object," including "a state or national flag," but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals threw out Mr. Johnson's conviction, ruling that his act was political speech protected by the First Amendment. The Dallas County district attorney asked the Supreme Court to reinstate the conviction.
The oral argument had moments of levity; "Mr. Kunstler, are we going to get back to this case?" said an exasperated Justice Thurgood Marshall, cracking up the courtroom as Mr. Johnson's lawyer, William Kunstler, jocularly chastised the court for leaving its flags up outside during the morning's rain.
Afterward, the justices retreated to one of the most private spaces in America, the Supreme Court conference room. There, on Wednesdays and Fridays following oral arguments, the nine justices conform to longstanding custom: The chief justice summarizes the case, explains his view and casts a straw vote. The associate justices follow in kind, in order of seniority.
Nobody else is present, no recording is made and no minutes or transcripts are published. But contemporaneous notes exist from these meetings—taken by the justices themselves. They cover the confidential discussions that led to some of the court's most consequential decisions—Brown v. Board of Education, holding school segregation unconstitutional; Baker v. Carr, which led to the one-person, one-vote principle; Griswold v. Connecticut, recognizing a right to privacy.


We Still Blame George W. Bush
Yesterday this column noted that judicial radicalism is increasingly embraced by establishment Democrats. At last night's Democratic debate, presidential candidates kicked around the idea of restructuring the Supreme Court by adding new Justices or perhaps forcing out current ones via term limits.
The general idea is to change the judiciary until it produces their desired political results. To his credit, former Vice President Joe Biden warned his fellow Democrats against attempting to pack the court with ideological allies, as it would surely reduce the public's respect for legal decisions.
But unfortunately the idea probably isn't going away. David Leonhardt, a relative moderate among the leftists at the New York Times opinion pages, recently expressed a view held by many elected Democrats when he wrote that "the country has reached the point where once-unthinkable solutions are worth debating." Added the Timesman:
I don't like the idea of court packing, which I think could lead to never-ending escalation between the parties and the potential breakdown of the judicial system. But I also find the status quo unacceptable: A court majority of dubious democratic legitimacy that sometimes acts as a kind of partisan super legislature..
And remember: Every 5-4 decision that breaks along partisan lines likely would have gone the other way if Senate Republicans hadn't stolen a seat from Obama.
By "stolen," Mr. Leonhardt means that in the appropriate exercise of its constitutional role in 2016, the Senate did not consent to President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.
And of course Mr. Leonhardt's smear goes much further, as he called the entire majority of the Supreme Court "of dubious democratic legitimacy." Here's his argument:


The Impeachment Needle May Soon Move
Things are more fluid than they seem. That's my impression of Washington right now. There's something quiet going on, a mood shift.
Impeachment of course will happen. The House will support whatever charges are ultimately introduced because most Democrats think the president is not fully sane and at least somewhat criminal. Also they're Democrats and he's a Republican. The charges will involve some level of foreign-policy malfeasance.
The ultimate outcome depends on the Senate. It takes 67 votes to convict. Republicans control the Senate 53-47, and it is unlikely 20 of them will agree to remove a president of their own party. An acquittal is likely but not fated, because we live in the age of the unexpected.
Here are three reasons to think the situation is more fluid than we realize.
First, the president, confident of acquittal, has chosen this moment to let his inner crazy flourish daily and dramatically—the fights and meltdowns, the insults, the Erdogan letter. Just when the president needs to be enacting a certain stability he enacts its opposite. It is possible he doesn't appreciate the jeopardy he's in with impeachment bearing down; it is possible he knows and what behavioral discipline he has is wearing down.


GOP Senators Widen Divide With Trump on Syria
Republican lawmakers responded to President Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria with phone calls to the White House, fiery floor speeches and legislation—crafted with Democrats—instructing Mr. Trump to explain his plan for Syria to Congress.
The public rebellion in the GOP grew on the same day Turkey agreed to a five-day suspension of its military offensive in Syria, and the U.S. in turn pulled back on economic sanctions.
Congressional Republicans showed no sign of softening their stance on the Syria policy, a day after the House passed a resolution by a 354-60 margin condemning the troop withdrawal.
A number of them, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), said they had spoken with Mr. Trump personally in recent days to express their concerns about Syria.
Others, including Sens. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), took to the Senate floor to deliver speeches criticizing the president's Syria policy.


Trump's Syria Exit Puts Yazidis in Peril
I am a Yazidi who was born and raised in Iraq. I worked for seven years as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq before immigrating to the U.S. in 2012. In 2014 I co-founded Yazda, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization, to support the Yazidi community after ISIS orchestrated a genocide against the Yazidi people.
I am still in shock over President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. This decision will have devastating consequences for religious minorities in Syria, especially Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims. Since the outbreak of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have protected religious minorities in Syria. In August 2014, at the moment of peril for my community, the SDF came to the Yazidis' rescue. These Syrian Kurdish forces, along with American air support, saved tens of thousands of lives. We will always remember their heroic effort.
I applaud the Trump administration for putting religious minorities at the forefront of its foreign policy. But I believe that the rushed exit from Syria jeopardizes the gains against ISIS and could enable future religious persecution.
Last year, in Turkish-controlled Afrin, a Turkish-backed Islamist militia known as the Free Syrian Army took a page from ISIS' book by destroying Yazidi holy sites, killing Yazidis, and coercing Yazidis to convert to Islam. Now, amid the American withdrawal, many Yazidis fear that radical groups like the FSA and ISIS will expand their influence and attempt to annihilate our community once again.
Mr. Trump says ISIS has been defeated, but this assessment is premature. It will re-emerge as soon as the pressure lets up. When that happens, American citizens and the Middle East's religious minorities will once again face a common threat.


Hillary Clinton Finds More to Deplore
Hillary Clinton insulting Trump voters is old news. But in a new interview the former secretary of State suggests that the deplorable population of the United States may be much larger than she previously claimed.
For readers too young to remember the presidential election of 2016, a standard applause line for Mrs. Clinton when speaking to crowds of wealthy coastal donors involved expressing her disapproval of millions of her fellow Americans. Here's part of the transcript from one such event published by Time magazine in September of 2016:
You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?
[Laughter/applause]
The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.
Since then, Mrs. Clinton has at times expressed regret for such remarks and at other times hurled still more insults when describing people who chose not to vote for her. But until this week she seemed concerned mainly with accusing Republicans of moral failings.
In a new podcast interview with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Mrs. Clinton says she was surprised to find out in 2016 how many sexists there were in both parties. And Mrs. Clinton, who continues throughout the interview to cling to the discredited theory that Russian interference is partly responsible for her 2016 loss, claims that one of the Democrats now running for President will actually be used by both Republicans and Russians to swing the election.

Immigration Cases, Judicial Vacancies Tax New Mexico Courts
LAS CRUCES, N.M.—With three of New Mexico's seven federal district judgeships currently vacant, the U.S. court system here was already in danger of being overwhelmed. At the same time, hundreds of migrants facing charges of crossing into the U.S. illegally are crowding into courtrooms daily and pushing the system to the breaking point, according to judges and attorneys.
While many migrants are being cycled in and out of court in a matter of minutes, other civil and criminal cases face delays and judges say they worry they don't have the bandwidth to properly consider complex decisions.
"When you combine the heavy caseloads with the vacancies, it's crushing," said New Mexico Chief District Judge William Johnson, nominated by George W. Bush in 2001.
The mass prosecution of migrants caught crossing the border illegally here is part of a Trump administration effort to reduce illegal immigration, as a record number of asylum-seeking families and unaccompanied children have been trying to enter the U.S.
But because New Mexico has the highest judicial vacancy rate among all border states, it is feeling the rise in immigration prosecutions more acutely than Texas, Arizona and California.


Many GOP Lawmakers Reject Trump Calling Impeachment Probe a 'Lynching'
WASHINGTON—A tweet by President Trump comparing the U.S. House's impeachment inquiry to a lynching became the latest test for Republicans, as GOP lawmakers seeking to criticize Democrats over the probe instead found themselves again on the defensive because of the president's rhetoric.
"All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching," Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning. "But we will WIN!"
More than 4,000 African-Americans were lynched in southern states between 1877 and 1950, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit focused on studying and recognizing the victims of such extrajudicial killings. The crimes were often done as a public spectacle to traumatize black people, the group says, and those killed often weren't guilty of any crime.
Democrats immediately condemned the president's remark. "For him to say something like that is disgusting," said Rep. Barbara Lee (D., Calif.).
Many Republicans also questioned the use of the word. Speaking at his weekly news conference with Senate GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said: "Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to lynching." He added, "That was an unfortunate choice of words. It is an unfair process."


Notable & Quotable: No Comment, Harvard
From "Harvard Student Groups Condemn The Crimson's Coverage of Abolish ICE Rally," Harvard Crimson, Oct. 22:
More than 650 people have signed onto an online petition condemning The Harvard Crimson's coverage of a protest demanding the abolition of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The petition—started by student-led immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream earlier this month—criticizes The Crimson for requesting comment from an ICE spokesperson for its Sept. 13 article, "Harvard Affiliates Rally for Abolish ICE Movement." The article covers a Sept. 12 protest hosted by Act on a Dream and quotes several students' criticisms of ICE, including calls for its dissolution. The article notes that ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. . . .
Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume '20 wrote in an emailed statement that The Crimson upholds "fundamental journalistic values" that "obligate" it to allow individuals and institutions it reports on to have a chance to comment. . . .


Clashes Break Out in Northern Syria, Testing Turkish Truce
BEIRUT—Renewed clashes between Kurdish and Turkish forces tested a shaky cease-fire in northern Syria on Friday, as the Russia-backed Syrian government moved troops into the area in part of its efforts to reclaim territory it ceded during the eight-year war.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, meanwhile, said the U.S. would reinforce its defense of oil fields in northeastern Syria, as America shifts away from President Trump's earlier planned full troop withdrawal from the region.
Speaking at a press conference after meetings in Brussels, Mr. Esper said the deployments would include some mechanized forces—a classification that includes tanks, artillery, armored vehicles and other heavy equipment.
The moves are the latest indication that several players are pushing to exert control in northern Syria after the sudden U.S. decision this month to withdraw roughly 1,000 troops who supported the Kurds in the fight against Islamic State.
Since then, Russia has consolidated its role as the main power broker in the country, while the U.S. has announced several new plans, confusing allies.


In Debut Before High Court, Ginsburg Got Only So-So Marks From One Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a revered Supreme Court justice who spent her early legal career fighting for women's rights. But one justice gave her original performance before the high court only passing marks.
"Prof. Ruth Ginsburg. C-plus," Justice Harry Blackmun wrote on loose-leaf paper during her first Supreme Court argument, Frontiero v. Laird, in January 1973. "Very precise. Female. Reads."
Perhaps alone among his colleagues, Justice Blackmun made detailed assessments of Supreme Court advocates, grading them like law students and often noting their hometowns, law schools and even their ethnicities. Several of those attorneys later joined the Supreme Court.
One was Antonin Scalia. "Plump. Dark," Justice Blackmun wrote, as the future jurist, then a Justice Department attorney, argued his only Supreme Court case, a January 1976 dispute involving Cuban cigar factories seized by the Castro regime. He got a grade of 85, equal to a B.
That sheet is among 15,000 handwritten pages Timothy Johnson, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, has copied from the papers of former Supreme Court justices for ScotusNotes, an online archive he is building to make original materials from the historically opaque institution available to the public.


Boris Johnson Leads Westminster to a Waterloo Over Brexit
London
Boris Johnson is finally facing his Waterloo. As ABBA sang, he couldn't escape it if he wanted to. The prime minister's battleground won't be on the road to Brussels, as it was for Napoleon Bonaparte, but on the road that leads through the voting booths and back to the House of Commons. Yet while his swagger may resemble Napoleon's, his strategic position gives him the battlefield advantages of Wellington.
Napoleon could count on the loyalty of his guards; Mr. Johnson, less so. His minority government is pinned down in Parliament by a grand alliance of anti-Brexit factions, including the Conservative deserters who blocked his deal with the European Union. Despite having secured revised Brexit terms from Brussels in his first 100 days in office, Mr. Johnson is all but certain to overshoot the already delayed deadline of Oct. 31.
Though Mr. Johnson averred six weeks ago that he'd rather be "dead in a ditch" than extend Brexit negotiations, lawmakers have forced him off the road, obliging him to request an extension from Brussels, and twice preventing him from rallying new parliamentary forces by calling a general election. Jeremy Corbyn, the far-left fanatic who leads the Labour Party, insists that this delay and obfuscation is for the nation's good. The British said much the same to Napoleon when they exiled him to the island of Elba. As Napoleon broke out and made a dash for Brussels, so Mr. Johnson is now trying to do the same.
On Thursday, Mr. Johnson announced that he will call for a general election on Dec. 12. Reculer pour mieux sauter: Retreat so as to advance better, after winning a majority in the House of Commons from a public that has had enough of Brexit delay and uncertainty. Mr. Johnson might have lost most of the recent skirmishes, but he has managed to do one better than his predecessor, Theresa May, by pushing the legislative foundations for Brexit through the Commons.


Chilean Capitalism on Trial
At press time it was too early to call a winner in Argentina's presidential election Sunday. But Peronist Alberto Fernández and his vice-presidential running mate, former President Cristina Kirchner, were widely expected to defeat the re-election bid of center-right President Mauricio Macri.
Primary results in August indicated that voters blame the incumbent for high inflation, the rising cost of public services and anemic economic growth. Yet a Fernández-Kirchner win implies a return to the left-wing populism that has long undermined Argentine living standards. Mrs. Kirchner's government (2007-2015) was notoriously corrupt and used its power to deny due process to its political enemies.
Mr. Macri made many mistakes, but he aimed for a more market-oriented economy and to restore the rule of law. His loss could turn out to be bad news for millions of Argentines who yearn for greater freedom.
Yet no one expects Argentina's center-right, if it loses, to go rampaging through the streets, burning cars, stealing, blocking roads and destroying public transportation. That kind of politics is the specialty of the left. It has been on display this month in Chile, where left-wing terrorists savaged Santiago and cities around the country with violence.
This happened in a nation that, as the newspaper La Tercera reported on Oct. 5, has seen the poverty rate fall below 9%, down from 68% in 1990. Income inequality has also been coming down.


Former President Tries to Turn the Tables on Powerful Bolivian Leader
LA PAZ, Bolivia—The politician leading the opposition against Bolivian President Evo Morales is well-schooled in the power of protest.
Carlos Mesa himself was forced to resign as president in the face of demonstrations in 2005. That time, the one leading the marchers in the streets was Mr. Morales, who was elected in a landslide six months later.
"It was a very educational experience," Mr. Mesa said.
Now he is attempting to use similar street tactics and international pressure to force Mr. Morales, one of the longest serving leaders in Latin America and a fierce critic of U.S. policy, to face him in a December runoff. The incumbent is claiming he won a fourth term in the first round of voting on Oct. 20, though electoral monitors say the process was rife with irregularities.
Mr. Mesa faces many hurdles. The ruling party, Movement Toward Socialism, controls all branches of government, including the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which counted the votes.


Mass Protests, Canceled Conferences Cloud Chilean President's Vision
SANTIAGO, Chile—President Sebastian Piñera has spent his first 20 months in office selling Chile as a prosperous and peaceful nation to foreign investors.
Today, he faces a far darker picture, as 17 days of unrest has left at least 23 people dead and prompted Mr. Piñera on Wednesday to say the country wouldn't be able to host two major international conferences that would have served as a showcase for his vision.
The chaos in the streets, where demonstrators have burned buildings and hurled Molotov cocktails at militarized police, was just too much for his government to control. More than a million people rallied last Friday, and protests continued on Wednesday.
"This is a very difficult decision that has caused us a lot of pain," Mr. Piñera, who has been tested like no other Chilean leader in 30 years of democracy, said in a televised announcement.
The end of the commodity boom had already hit Chile's once-vibrant economy. But the government now says the paralysis in the capital Santiago, a city of 6.7 million, has further undermined this year's projected 2.5% economic growth. On Wednesday, the Santiago stock market fell 2.8%.


The Democrats' Spooky Politics
It was this weekend in 2012 that I went to a Halloween party wearing a quite realistic-looking Joe Biden mask. After about an hour, people said it was too spooky and asked me to take it off. When the Obama presidency ended, I threw the Biden mask away, assuming I'd never need it again. Wishful thinking is always a mistake.
With Halloween in the air, it's the right moment to discuss the central role played in presidential politics by bogeymen—creatures conjured to distract and scare the citizenry. In politics, the bogeyman is always just around the corner. For John F. Kennedy it was "the missile gap"; for Barack Obama, "the wealthiest"; and for Donald Trump, criminals pouring across "the border."
Naturally, the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination needed a bogeyman, and they have created one even scarier than the Trump monster. It's them—"corporations!" At their recent presidential debate, one candidate after another claimed corporations were wrecking the country.
Elizabeth Warren, who knows a thing or two about scaring people: "They have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line." And by the way, "I have a plan." Yikes.
Cory Booker ranted about "corporate tax incentives," and Amy Klobuchar wants a rollback of "what we did with the corporate tax rate." Beto O'Rourke somehow related a woman he said was working four jobs with "some of these corporations," and Tom Steyer, billionaire, said we have to "break the power of these corporations."


White House Official Says He Heard Ukraine Aid Was Tied to Biden Probe
WASHINGTON—A White House national security official testified that a U.S. diplomat told him a hold on U.S. aid to Ukraine was tied to efforts to push Kyiv to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son, backing testimony of earlier witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry.
The official, Tim Morrison, also said Thursday he had concerns about what he heard on President Trump's July 25 call with his Ukrainian counterpart, but he had no worries about the legality of the issues the leaders discussed.
Mr. Morrison, who oversaw National Security Council policy on Europe and Russia from July until his departure was announced Wednesday, told House impeachment investigators that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani were trying to press Ukraine to reopen probes into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden sat on the board.
According to his opening statement reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Morrison said he understood from a Sept. 1 conversation with Mr. Sondland that the investigations were tied to the nearly $400 million in held-up aid.
Also that day, Mr. Morrison said he told Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, that Mr. Sondland had told an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the U.S. aid would be released if Ukraine committed to investigating Burisma Group.


Firefighters Battle New Blazes in Southern California
Firefighters across California are finishing a week spent battling at least one major fire a day, as powerful winds and low humidity continue to plague much of the state.
The latest blaze, a fast-moving brush fire in Ventura County in Southern California, started Thursday night and quickly grew to more than 8,700 acres. Thousands of area residents added to the growing number of people forced from their homes this week.
The Maria Fire, atop South Mountain near Santa Paula, Calif., was fueled by eastward winds and dry vegetation. The fire threatened nearby avocado and citrus orchards and about 1,800 structures, and forced 7,500 people to evacuate. It destroyed at least two structures, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.
By midday Friday, the fire was 0% contained and winds had shifted, carrying flames toward Santa Paula. Ventura County officials said more evacuations could be ordered in the region.
A red flag warning—signaling powerful winds and low humidity that can make fires more dangerous—is now expected to be extended for the region until Saturday afternoon.


Developing Wind Farm in New York Is No Breeze
LOWVILLE, N.Y.—Calvin Roes can see wind turbines peaking over the hill west of his dairy farm, and more if he looks north into the neighboring town. He is frustrated that a new development is stalled.
It has been more than three years since Mr. Roes, 60 years old, agreed to host part of the Invenergy's proposed 106-megawatt wind farm, called Number Three, on his land. The lease will mean new roads to his fields and a welcome stream of cash
"It would take a lot of pressure off, and for dairy right now, we could use some supplemental income," Mr. Roes said.
But after an extra back-and-forth with regulators and an unexpected delay in August, the developers of Number Three say it is in jeopardy. It also isn't the only project that has stalled: 15 other land-based wind farms are currently awaiting approval by a state siting board created under a 2011 law called Article 10.
Electrical-generating facilities are often controversial in the communities that host them, and projects along Lake Ontario and in the North Country have fizzled amid concerns about noise, view-sheds and impacts to migrating birds.


Regulatory Mop Up at the Court
The Supreme Court Wednesday will consider in Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund whether groundwater is a "navigable water." Ridiculous as this question may seem, the case reveals the ambitions of liberals who want to use water as a regulatory phalanx.
At issue is whether the County of Maui must obtain a permit from the Environmental Protection Administration to inject treated wastewater into underground wells. The county is in compliance with state law and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but environmental groups say it needs an EPA discharge permit.
The Clean Water Act identifies an exhaustive list of pollutants including sand and dirt that may not be discharged into "navigable waters" without an EPA permit. Over the years the EPA and courts have extended the law to non-navigable streams, ponds and canals. The Obama EPA's attempt to add prairie potholes and backyard ponds was stopped by the Trump Administration.
Environmental groups now argue that the Clean Water Act also covers groundwater discharges since pollutants can seep from soil into "navigable waters." The science isn't in dispute. But Congress intentionally excluded groundwater discharges because they are difficult to measure, monitor and control. Other laws regulate groundwater pollutants. The Clean Water Act also directs states to address runoff that can cause groundwater pollution, and the EPA sometimes lends financial assistance.
Under the U.S. system of cooperative federalism, states have exercised their police powers to protect groundwater. California recently limited groundwater pumping in the state's Central Valley. Texas requires a permit to discharge any waste into groundwater. Every state regulates groundwater in one way or another.


In Roger Stone Trial, Prosecutors Focus On Contacts With Trump Campaign, Wikileaks
WASHINGTON—Roger Stone lied to Congress to shield his longtime friend and associate Donald Trump from embarrassment, federal prosecutors alleged Wednesday at the opening of the political consultant's criminal trial.
Prosecutors, in their opening statement, said Mr. Stone was in touch with people at the highest levels of the Trump campaign about his interactions with the organization WikiLeaks during the 2016 election.
They introduced into evidence emails, text messages and call logs, many of which hadn't been made public, that they said detailed an extensive campaign by Mr. Stone to contact the organization and share information about its plans. Mr. Stone is charged with lying to Congress about those efforts.
Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump were in constant communication shortly after key developments involving the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails, according to call logs introduced in court.
Prosecutors noted that one of their conversations occurred within an hour of Mr. Stone telling an associate to make contact with WikiLeaks in July of 2016, though they said the content of that call was unknown.


New York Attorney General Drops Part of Exxon Case
The New York attorney general's office Thursday dropped part of its securities-fraud case against Exxon Mobil Corp. on the final day of a rare climate-change-related trial that has pushed the oil giant's accounting practices into public view.
Attorney general's office lawyers withdrew two fraud counts at the end of a nearly three-week trial examining Exxon's public and private estimates of potential climate-change regulations on its future business. But the attorney general's office proceeded with two counts that require the elements of the Martin Act, a New York state antifraud law with a lower bar of proof: that Exxon made misrepresentations to investors and that those deceptions mattered.
The attorney general's office pulled back the civil fraud counts during closing arguments of a trial that has been closely watched for its implications for the largest American oil company and the energy industry in general.
Attorney General Letitia James has accused Exxon of deceiving its investors about its financial modeling for policies that countries might enact to combat climate change. The oil company told investors it used one formula to account for these future regulations, but internally used lower numbers, the office has argued.
Jonathan Zweig, a lawyer in the attorney general's office, said the case wasn't about whether Exxon's employees were good people, as the company's lawyers suggested. "The question in this case is whether Exxon's disclosures were accurate," Mr. Zweig said. "And the evidence shows that they were not."


Trump Says He May Release Transcript of Earlier Ukraine Call
WASHINGTON—President Trump said he is likely to release the full transcript of his April telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, a day before public impeachment hearings are set to begin in the U.S. House.
"The witch hunt continues," he said to reporters Saturday while departing the White House to attend the Louisiana State University Tigers vs. Alabama Crimson Tide football game. "The Republicans have never been so united, and I think the people of our country have never been so united."
Mr. Trump called Mr. Zelensky to congratulate him in April after his victory in that country's presidential election, and then again in July. A rough transcript of the July call has already been released by the White House.
Meanwhile, House Republicans have asked to call Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, as well as an anonymous whistleblower whose initial complaint sparked the investigation that has roiled the Trump administration.
Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has submitted a list of eight individual witnesses that he would like to testify as part of next week's public hearings into whether the president committed an impeachment offense in his dealings with Ukraine.


U.S.-Mexico Border Arrests Fall in October
WASHINGTON—The U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 36,300 people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in October, a 10% drop from the previous month, according to new numbers reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The latest figure represents a nearly 75% decrease from May, when the number of migrants crossing the border peaked at 132,856. The monthly numbers have dropped steadily since.
Overall, more than 850,000 migrants were apprehended at the border in 2019, a 12-year high for the year ended in September, driven by a rise in families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America to seek asylum protections in the U.S.
The surge in migrants, nearly double the number who arrived in 2018, overwhelmed the government's border facilities and prompted Congress to pass an emergency aid package to improve cramped and squalid conditions inside the detention centers where migrants are being held.
The spike also prompted the Trump administration to search for new tools and policies that might deter more people from attempting the journey.


Schiff's 'Obstruction' Theory
Is it an impeachable offense for a president to resist impeachment? House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN last week that White House officials' refusal to testify in his committee's impeachment probe could lead to "obstruction of Congress" charges against President Trump. At a press conference last month, he warned the White House against trying to "stonewall our investigation" and said: "Any action like that, that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation, will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice."
He's wrong. In the absence of a definitive judicial ruling to the contrary, the president has a well-established constitutional right—even a duty—to resist such demands. The Constitution authorized the House to impeach the president if it has evidence of "high crimes and misdemeanors," but it does not require the president, who heads an equal branch of government, to cooperate in gathering such evidence. Accordingly, the Trump administration has refused to honor various document-production requests, and has instructed some current and former officials to ignore committee subpoenas.
Not all officials have complied with this instruction, but those who have—including former national security adviser John Bolton, former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and deputy White House counsel John Eisenberg—are acting lawfully and appropriately.
It has long been established that the president, and by extension his advisers, have two types of immunity from making disclosures to Congress. One applies to national-security information, the other to communications with immediate advisers, whether related to national security or not. Both immunities, when applicable, are absolute, which means they can't be trumped by competing congressional needs.
The national-security privilege was most definitively explained in a 1989 memorandum from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). It noted that the privilege is anchored in the longstanding right "not to disclose state secrets," first asserted by President Thomas Jefferson and affirmed by the courts in 1807. Although the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an assertion of executive privilege for all presidential communications in U.S. v. Nixon (1974), it "unmistakably implied," according to the OLC memo, "that the President does enjoy an absolute state secrets privilege."


Hong Kong Police, Protesters Strain to End Campus Standoff
HONG KONG—A standoff between protesters and police at a university here extended into a second night, with police keeping the area on lockdown while refraining from using the lethal force they had threatened, as increasingly militant antigovernment activists battled back.
Late Monday, police allowed a group of high-school principals to enter the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus after a group of self-appointed mediators—including the former head of the city's legislature Jasper Tsang—were allowed inside. They said they had an understanding with police to allow those 18 years of age and under to leave without being immediately arrested. The principals emerged early Tuesday with a group of about 30 students, while dozens more began to come out peacefully.
The principals told reporters they understood that authorities would record the identities of students under 18, though police could decide to take legal action at a later date. Police and government officials have urged protesters to give themselves up peacefully for arrest.
About 100 protesters remain on campus, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday. A third of the 600 people who have left PolyU are under 18 and were let go without being arrested. The rest——around 400 people——are adults and were arrested, she said.
Police on Monday afternoon fired tear gas, pepper bullets and water cannon at dozens of black-clad protesters who jumped railings and tried to flee the campus, driving many back in. Scuffles broke out as protesters hurled bricks while holding umbrellas for cover.


Sweden Opens Investigations Into Iraq's Defense Minister
Sweden is investigating Iraq's defense minister for suspected crimes against humanity as well as benefits fraud related to his time as a refugee in the Scandinavian country, Swedish prosecutors and police said.
A spokeswoman for the prosecutor, who announced the human-rights probe on Monday, declined to give any detail about the allegations against Najah Shimmari, including whether they related to his role as a general under Saddam Hussein or his time as defense minister in the current government.
Swedish police said separately they were investigating whether Mr. Shimmari, who lived in the country as a refugee between 2011 and 2015 and became a Swedish citizen, continued collecting benefits for himself and his family even after returning to Iraq, when he became a minister.
The investigations come amid mass antigovernment protests in Iraq that are now in their second month, fueled in part by anger over corruption. Security forces have responded with force, leaving nearly 350 people dead, according to the country's human-rights commission.
The news of the probe was earlier reported by the Nyheter Idag website in Sweden.


U.S., Europeans Clash Over How to Handle Islamic State Detainees
Washington and its European allies are at odds over how to prosecute and detain about 2,000 foreign Islamic State fighters being held in Syria, eight months after U.S.-backed forces seized the last sliver of the group's self-described caliphate there.
The problem became urgent in October when Turkish forces intervened in northern Syria, spurring fears that the fighters might escape detention in the confusion. Fewer than 200 prisoners have fled, according to the U.S. military, and the fears abated after a U.S.-arranged cease-fire took effect.
But U.S. officials say a lasting solution is needed in case the region's tenuous stability collapses.
"My experience is even small cells of these people are quite dangerous," said John Allen, the retired Marine Corps general who served as the U.S. special envoy to the coalition that is fighting Islamic State militants. "Every day we wait on this, we're one day closer to their release or getting loose."
There is broad agreement on the problem. The international coalition battling Islamic State called in November for establishing "accountability mechanisms" to deal with foreign terrorist fighters and their families in Iraq and Syria.


New York City Braces for Up to 6 Inches of Snow
New York City was expected to get 3 to 6 inches of snow on Monday, with the storm disrupting some evening commutes but ending hours before Tuesday's morning rush hour.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said Monday that the city had prepared 1,500 plows in case the accumulation reached 2 inches, in addition to the 700 salt spreaders that began canvassing the city earlier in the day.
The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory for the New York City region and parts of northeastern New Jersey that will be in effect until early Tuesday morning. John Feerick, senior meteorologist for Accuweather.com, said that "other than a few icy spots," all should be clear for Tuesday's morning commute.
Meanwhile, Mr. Feerick said upstate New York communities were "walloped" by a snowstorm that began on Sunday, though he added that snowfall in those regions should taper off in the early hours of Tuesday.
Parts of Albany and Syracuse have received more than a foot of snow, and in Saratoga County, residents have been hit with as much as 20 inches.


Schiff Impeaches Biden
Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the least surprising news of the year Thursday by announcing that the House will proceed to impeach President Trump. Once she fired the "inquiry" missile, it could never be called back.
The question now is what precisely the articles of impeachment will say, and in particular we wonder if they will include the charge of bribery. If they do, Joe Biden should prepare for a Senate grilling.
Recall that Adam Schiff, the leading House impeachment advocate, has been floating a capacious definition of bribery that bears no relation to current law. "Well, bribery, first of all, as the Founders understood bribery, it was not as we understand it in law today. It was much broader," he told NPR. "It connoted the breach of the public trust in a way where you're offering official acts for some personal or political reason, not in the nation's interest."
Mr. Schiff repeated this definition during his Intelligence Committee hearings, and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) made the same point this week when he claimed in the Washington Post that "federal law defines bribery as the solicitation of 'anything of value personally' by a public official 'in return for' an official act."
Voila, the charge is that Donald Trump solicited a bribe when he tried to withhold a White House meeting or military aid to Ukraine's new President in return for investigations into corruption and Joe and Hunter Biden. Mrs. Pelosi says the witnesses summoned by Mr. Schiff "corroborated" the bribery charge.


The Labor Virtues of Growth
Economic growth is out of political fashion these days, as intellectuals on the left and right put a higher priority on reducing inequality. Yet as Friday's blowout jobs report for November showed, the best way to lift Americans from the bottom up is a growing economy that produces a robust labor market.
Job gains exploded on the upside with 266,000 added for the month, on top of upward revisions of 41,000 for September and October. The jobless rate fell again to 3.5%, which is a 50-year-low. Job growth has averaged 180,000 a month so far this year, which is down from 223,000 in all of 2018 but is still remarkably healthy for 10 years into an economic expansion.
As you'd expect in a tight labor market, the benefits are accruing for the less skilled or formerly jobless. The number of Americans who were marginally attached to the labor force—i.e., those able to work but who are not actively seeking employment—fell by 432,000 from last November to 1.2 million. That's a whopping 27% year-over-year decline.
About 460,000 fewer workers are employed part-time for economic reasons than a year ago. More than 80% of folks who work part time do so for noneconomic reasons, and the share has been increasing as the economy has gained strength. Second earners in two-income households have the luxury to work less when their spouses are earning more.
Even in a strong economy, workers will lose jobs and there's no denying President Trump's trade brawl has caused casualties. But the good news is that most laid-off workers can find work relatively quickly. Only 20.8% of the unemployed have been out of work for 27 weeks or more compared to 24.7% in December 2016 and a peak of 45.2% in September 2011.


'Boom, Boom, Boom': Migrants Sent Back to War Zone by Libyan Coast Guard
OFF THE LIBYAN COAST—Adrift on an inflatable raft in the Mediterranean Sea, 45 African migrants used a satellite phone to send an SOS message, hoping for a rescue ship to take them to Italy.
Instead, a Libyan Coast Guard vessel arrived with first aid kits, life preservers and an AK-47 to force the thirsty, saltwater-caked migrants aboard and return them to a war zone in Libya.
A pact to halt illegal migration between Italy and Libya, and backed by the European Union, has made the Libyan Coast Guard the de facto border patrol for Europe. Migrants and refugees, who arrive to Libya after fleeing conflict and poverty at home, are hazarding the dangerous crossing through the Mediterranean only to be intercepted and returned to Libya. There, they are held in detention centers near front lines and preyed upon by militias.
Despite the interceptions, attempted sea crossings are on the rise, the International Organization for Migration reported last month, driven by rising violence in Libya's civil war.
The peril in Libya only deepened May Oscar's desperation to reach Europe. By the time the 22-year-old Cameroonian ended up on the raft for his fourth attempt, he had already traversed half a continent, paid numerous smugglers and endured months in Libyan detention centers. In July, an airstrike on the Tajoura Detention Center outside the capital, Tripoli, killed dozens of migrants and refugees and sent Mr. Oscar fleeing. He'd studied Spanish back home to prepare for a life in Spain.


Barr Rejects Finding That FBI Was Justified in Opening Trump Probe
WASHINGTON—Attorney General William Barr quickly and sharply disputed a watchdog's key finding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was legally justified in opening its Russia inquiry, further enmeshing the Justice Department in a partisan battle over the bureau's probe of President Trump and his associates.
Mr. Barr's remarks also suggested that a federal prosecutor he appointed to take a separate look at the investigation would come to a different conclusion.
Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's inspector general, determined in a report released Monday that the FBI had adequate basis in 2016 to open its investigation and found no direct evidence that political bias influenced the inquiry. But Mr. Barr pointed to the report's more scathing findings of FBI errors and missteps, echoing Mr. Trump's own long-held complaints about the investigation of his presidential campaign.
"The inspector general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken," Mr. Barr said in a lengthy statement issued immediately following the report's release. "Nevertheless, the investigation and surveillance was pushed forward for the duration of the campaign and deep into President Trump's administration."
Mr. Barr said that FBI officials, in their rush to obtain surveillance warrants, had "omitted critical exculpatory facts from their filings and suppressed or ignored information negating the reliability of their principal source."


Pensacola Hit by Cyberattack Days After Shooting at Military Base
The city of Pensacola, Fla., was hit with a cyberattack, shutting down much of the city computer network, days after a Saudi air force student opened fire at a military base there.
"The city of Pensacola is experiencing a cyberattack that began this weekend that is impacting our city network, including phones and email at City Hall and some of our other buildings," Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson said at a Monday briefing.
The mayor said he didn't know if the attack was connected to Friday's shooting, when a Saudi flight student opened fire in a classroom at Naval Air Station Pensacola before he was shot to death by authorities.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Friday's shooting. It couldn't be determined if the cyberattack had any impact on the investigation.
The FBI in Jacksonville said it was aware "of a potential cyber related incident" and "are providing resources to assist," according to a tweet on Monday afternoon. The FBI field office wasn't immediately available for comment.


Russia, Ukraine Agree on Cease-Fire in Eastern Ukraine
PARIS—The leaders of Russia and Ukraine agreed on measures to de-escalate the conflict in Eastern Ukraine but fell short of a breakthrough in talks aimed at lowering tensions in a region that has become a flashpoint between Moscow and the West.
In their first face-to-face meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian-turned-politician who was elected in April, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said they agreed to implement a cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners by the end of the year. They also agreed on limited troop withdrawal in certain areas, and a plan to remove mines from the conflict zone.
"We unblocked dialogue with Russia, a positive step..Unfortunately we couldn't settle all issues today," Mr. Zelensky said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who mediated the talks.
"The process is going in the right direction," Mr. Putin said, while acknowledging differences between Moscow and Kyiv's positions remain.
Monday's agreement was limited in scope, mainly reaffirming a peace deal reached four years ago in Minsk, Belarus. That accord stipulates the return of the border with Russia to Ukrainian control, the holding of elections in separatist-held regions and the granting of more autonomy to areas of Eastern Ukraine held by separatists. The deal's implementation, however, has stalled as skirmishes and shelling have continued across the front line. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations that they aren't complying with the agreement.


Lawmakers Say Staten Island Should Stand Alone
New York City's "forgotten borough" would take a step toward becoming its own city under a proposed bill that is reigniting debate over Staten Island's possible secession.
City council members Joseph Borelli and Steven Matteo introduced a bill Tuesday to study the possibility of the county seceding from the city, a plan that was approved by island voters in 1993 but later blocked by the state.
Both Republican council members say Staten Island has limited say in the city and doesn't get equal services. Residents say their biggest issues—such as high property taxes and transportation—aren't being addressed by City Hall, Mr. Borelli said.
"Staten Islanders complain to me very accurately and precisely about problems they face, and unfortunately, even as a city council member I don't have the authority and power to actually solve some of those problems," he said. "If we secede, we would have the power to solve some of those problems."
With fewer than 500,000 residents, Staten Island is the least-populous borough and has the fewest representatives on the City Council.


Colorado Set to Vote on Endangered Gray Wolf
Colorado residents may get a chance to help decide the fate of gray wolves in the West in what experts say appears to be the first time voters could reintroduce an endangered species.
On Tuesday, a coalition of groups seeking to bring wolves back to the state turned in enough signatures to put that question on Colorado's ballot next November. The fight over gray wolves, which the Trump administration wants to remove from Endangered Species Act protection, has long pitted conservationists against ranchers and hunters.
The measure asks voters if they want to begin reintroducing wolves to public lands in western Colorado by the end of 2023.
Rob Edward, president of the lead group behind the initiative, said the reintroduction would help offset the detrimental ecological impacts that eradicating wolves from the region has had and create natural geographic continuity with wolf habitats in other Western states.
"Colorado voters have made clear once again that they enthusiastically support restoring the natural balance to Colorado's wild public lands," Mr. Edward said in a statement.


New Zealand Recovers Six Bodies as Volcano Threatens to Erupt Again
The New Zealand military hurried to retrieve bodies early Friday from a volcano that scientists say has a significant chance of erupting again.
The remains of six people killed by Monday's sudden eruption on White Island, which generated fierce heat and sent a 12,000-foot plume of smoke into the sky, were airlifted by helicopter to a waiting navy frigate on Friday morning. Earlier drone flights over the ash-covered island had pinpointed where the bodies lay.
Another body was seen in water on Tuesday and divers were attempting to recover it on Saturday. One more person remains unaccounted for.
Safety concerns had put off a recovery mission for days. Many of the tourists evacuated from the island on Monday suffered terrible burns, some to around 80% of their bodies. The official death toll had risen to eight by Friday morning, and it will climb once the bodies of those classified as missing on the island are retrieved.
Authorities fretted about noxious gases emitted from the volcano crater and the potential for another eruption on an island with no shelter. On board the HMNZS Wellington frigate on Friday, scientists from New Zealand's hazard monitoring organization studied data to assess risks in real time.


Voting-Machine Parts Made by Foreign Suppliers Stir Security Concerns
A voting machine that is widely used across the country contains some parts made by companies with ties to China and Russia, researchers found, fueling questions about the security of using overseas suppliers, which has also sparked scrutiny in Washington.
Voting-machine vendors could be at risk of using insecure components from such overseas suppliers, which generally are difficult to vet and monitor, said a report released Monday by Interos Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based supply-chain monitoring company that has consulted for government agencies and Fortune 500 companies.
The findings are likely to fan worries about whether voting-machine vendors are doing enough to defend themselves against foreign interference ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections, which U.S. intelligence officials say hostile powers could try to disrupt.
Voting-machine vendors assailed the research, which Interos conducted independently, saying the report failed to note existing safeguards, such as testing done at the federal, state and local levels, and the vendors' internal protocols.
The report comes as U.S. lawmakers and national-security officials increasingly have sounded alarms about supply-chain risks. Although supply chains that span the globe are common in the tech industry, Russia and China pose concerns because of how, according to U.S. officials, they press companies for access to technology within their borders.


Egypt Frees Jailed Sisi Challenger
CAIRO—The Egyptian military on Sunday released one of the country's former chiefs-of-staff, nearly two years after his arrest following an announcement that he would challenge President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in the 2018 presidential vote, military officials and his lawyer said.
A military court had sentenced Sami Annan, 71 years old, earlier this year to nine years' imprisonment. He was taken into custody in January last year on charges of fraudulently registering to vote and of breaching regulations by declaring his intention to run in the presidential election without first clearing it with the military.
The former general was also charged with incitement against the armed forces over a video he released declaring his candidacy.
The military at the time said Mr. Annan was still formally in the reserves and therefor ineligible to vote. Mr. Sisi won the vote virtually unchallenged and was re-elected.
Mr. Annan's lawyer, Naser Amin, said the former general was released for health reasons and that he was already back at his home in Cairo.


Saudi Arabia and Kuwait End Dispute Over Shared Oil Fields
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ended a five-year dispute over oil fields in a territory shared between the two countries, the latest sign of detente between Riyadh and its Persian Gulf neighbors.
The deal, disclosed in a statement issued by Riyadh and Kuwait City on Tuesday, has been a pet project of new Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman, half brother to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He has spent years trying to broker differences between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over land and environmental rights in what is known as the Neutral Zone. The stakes are especially high because the territory is the home to prodigious oil reserves.
Normally the region can produce about 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day. The dispute—a rare public spat between two otherwise-close Persian Gulf allies—erupted in late 2014, leading to the complete shutdown of the Neutral Zone's oil fields in early 2015.
Negotiations to reopen the Neutral Zone have been backed by the U.S. Washington made a diplomatic push last year over the issue, to help ensure abundant quantities of oil remained available to make up for falling global supplies form sanctions imposed on Iran and Venezuela.
U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. , which operates in the Neutral Zone, welcomed the agreement. It said full production, at pre-shutdown capacity, was expected within 12 months.


Pentagon Considering a Troop Reduction in West Africa
The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense, the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
Mr. Esper during the fall requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper since has approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.


GOP Unity Doesn't Arise From Fear of Trump
Republicans have gained ground in the battle over impeachment. They voted unanimously in the House against taking up impeachment in the first place and then opposed both articles—abuse of power and obstructing Congress—without a defection. Unanimity mattered. It was a blow to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who couldn't claim impeachment was bipartisan.
Much of the press has settled on an explanation for GOP unity: Republicans are "afraid" of President Trump. Don't buy it. The House GOP's rejection of impeachment had much less to do with Mr. Trump than with Democratic fanaticism.
It's too early to know if that unity will transfer to the Senate—Alaska's Lisa Murkowski has predictably signaled uncertainty—but take a look at the 21 House Republicans who are retiring and not seeking another office in 2020. They are in a position to vote their conscience, several are Trump critics—and all voted "no." The last to declare was Florida's Rep. Francis Rooney. He had criticized Mr. Trump on the Ukraine issue, but on the day of the vote he said impeachment had "become more of a political process than a process destined to find justice and truth."
Four other Republicans had been seen as possible votes to impeach. For Democrats, they were the Only Hope Quartet: Fred Upton of Michigan, Susan Brooks of Indiana, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Will Hurd of Texas. Two of them, Ms. Brooks and Mr. Hurd, are retiring.
Mr. Upton, a reliable moderate since his first election in 1992, is no Trump fan. His kind demeanor clashes with the president's harshness. He didn't endorse Mr. Trump in 2016 and condemned the president for tweeting that Democratic congresswomen should "go back and help fix the . . . places from which they came." But as much as Mr. Upton likes bipartisanship, he is appalled at Democrats for wanting to "overturn the last election." The president's behavior was inappropriate, he says, "but was it impeachable? My answer is no."


Equal Opportunity Discrimination
Protecting the constitutional separation of powers is back in political fashion as more businesses challenge abuses of administrative agencies. One case worth watching is Oracle 's lawsuit arguing that the Labor Department has usurped the federal judiciary and other executive agencies.
Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) filed a discrimination complaint against Oracle in the waning days of the Obama Administration. During a routine audit, the OFCCP in 2014 conducted a statistical analysis of Oracle's workforce. And what do you know? The agency says it discovered disparities based on race and sex that it claimed were prima facie evidence of discrimination.
For instance, Labor found that Asians were overrepresented in some technical positions relative to Oracle's applicant pool but were underpaid relative to whites in others. The agency alleged that Oracle hired fewer whites than Asians for certain positions, but paid them more than blacks in other jobs.
In sum, the agency said Oracle discriminated against every class of worker in one way or another. It demanded that Oracle lose current and forgo future federal contracts plus pay up to $400 million in restitution to its alleged victims. Yet its case all but collapsed at an administrative trial this month.
The Labor office presented no evidence of intentional discrimination or even witnesses who claimed as much. One former worker said she had heard a senior VP say, "Well, if you hire a woman, she will work harder for less money," but the incident occurred 19 years ago and the accused denied making the comment.


Iran-Backed Kataib Hezbollah Has Long Targeted U.S. Forces
BEIRUT—The Iranian-backed Iraqi militia targeted by U.S. airstrikes on Sunday was among the Shiite groups that joined in the fight against Islamic State. But for nearly two decades it has also attacked American forces and helped stoke sectarian strife in the Middle East.
One of the most secretive and influential Shiite militias in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah has close ties with the Quds Force, Iran's Revolutionary Guard unit for international operations.
The group was formed following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and gained a reputation from the outset for targeting U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq with roadside bombs and mortars. Kataib Hezbollah has said its main goal is to thwart the American project in the region and expel U.S. soldiers from Iraq.
Little is known about the Kataib Hezbollah group's structure, but it is part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, an umbrella for dozens of militias, many of them Shiite, of about 140,000 members that are part of the Iraqi security apparatus.
The PMF is the largest armed group in Iraq outside state control, and was formed in 2014 as the regular security forces were collapsing. With their growing importance in securing Iraq against Sunni extremists, the militias have gained political importance.


A Generic Politician Can't Beat Trump
One business lesson Donald Trump has applied in politics is to be original. Companies spend tremendous sums to make unique products, brand them and protect them from copying. Electoral messages are easy to copy, yet few candidates seem to recognize the threat.
Mr. Trump may be the most copy-proof politician in modern history. "I do my best work off script," he told the Black Voices for Trump Coalition in Atlanta in the fall. "I also do my worst work off script." He gets away with his worst work because of his best work, which rivals have proved incapable of imitating.
Most of this happens through their own self-limitation. Mr. Trump has found an issue mix that other candidates' orthodoxy prevents them from adopting. Democrats can't embrace border security, across-the-board tax cuts or limits on abortion; Republicans shy away from tariffs, entitlements and limits on foreign aid. Both parties were equally flummoxed about how to argue against Mr. Trump's policy mix and tried unsuccessfully at different times to use his behavior to disqualify him.
Mr. Trump's political prowess includes his behavior. The virtues he eschews—formality and restraint—are among the most easily learned behaviors, which is why they are taught to children. Most politicians display them in spades, yet they're unpopular as a class.
By contrast, communicating off the cuff to audiences is something politicians generally avoid because it's risky and takes a long time to become comfortable with. Even as Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a political megaphone, almost all tweets coming from his Democratic antagonists and Republican supporters read like press releases.


Almost 10,000 Children of Islamic State Live in Limbo in Syrian Camps
AL-HOL, Syria—The crack of a gunshot scattered a group of women throwing stones at a surveillance camera watching over the camp where they have been held with their children since the fall of Islamic State's would-be caliphate.
As the internment of these non-Syrian adherents of the terror group drags on, desperation is swelling in the al-Hol camp, raising tensions between them and those left to guard this bleak assemblage of sagging tents surrounded by a chain-link fence.
Nine months since Islamic State's experiment collapsed, thousands of children remain trapped here and in several other camps in northeast Syria—victims of geopolitics and hostage to the fortunes of their parents.
Only a fraction have made it out, including seven Swedish orphans whose grandfather, Patricio Galvez, traveled here in April and found them malnourished and traumatized. His journey helped pressure the Swedish government into taking them home.
Since then, a number of other countries—notably Kazakhstan and Kosovo—have moved to repatriate a total of around 350 children from Syria in 2019, according to Save the Children.


Judge Dismisses Case Over Testimony of Trump Administration Official
WASHINGTON—A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit brought by a former White House national security official asking whether he could be forced to testify before Congress over the objection of the Trump administration.
Former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman filed suit in October after he was subpoenaed by House investigators as part of the impeachment probe into President Trump. Mr. Kupperman was ordered by the White House not to appear on the disputed legal theory that close presidential advisers couldn't be forced to appear before Congress.
Mr. Kupperman's lawsuit claimed he faced "irreconcilable commands" from both the legislative and executive branch and asked a federal court to sort out the matter. Both the House of Representatives and the Trump administration asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed on various grounds.
On Monday, Judge Richard Leon sided with both branches of government, ordering the case be dismissed on the grounds that it was moot. The House has withdrawn its subpoena of Mr. Kupperman and promised not to reissue it—leaving the court with no dispute to resolve.
"Kupperman no longer faces the 'irreconcilable commands' of two coordinate branches of government, and he accordingly lacks any personal stake in the outcome of this dispute," wrote Judge Leon, an appointee of Republican George W. Bush. "Thus, it would appear that this case is moot and should be dismissed."


Boris and Britain After Brexit
London
British historian Andrew Roberts is known for his rigorous yet lyrical biographies of Napoleon and Churchill, along with sweeping histories of World War II and the English-speaking peoples. Then there was his failed attempt at fiction.
Inspired by the 1993 Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union, "I sat down and wrote a euroskeptic novel called 'The Aachen Memorandum,' " he recalls in a pre-Christmas interview at his London home. It was published in 1995. "I do recommend your readers not to read it," he says. "It was attempting to be a dystopian novel set in a future European superstate. It was supposed to be a whodunit, a thriller, and a political novel. It fell between all four stools—appalling badly."
The novel's only saving grace was its prescience. Amid ill-advised sex scenes and overwrought dialogue, Mr. Roberts imagined that 51.86% of British voters would reject EU membership in 2015. He was off by a year and 0.03%. "I consider myself the Nostradamus of the Thatcherites," he says with a laugh.
After three prime ministers, 31⁄2 years and more uncertainty than Mr. Roberts would have liked, Britain's departure from the EU is weeks away from becoming reality. On Dec. 12 Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won a thumping majority in parliamentary elections with a promise to "get Brexit done." The U.K. now is all but certain to leave on Jan. 31.


California Democratic Party Settles Harassment, Discrimination Claims
The California Democratic Party agreed to settle three lawsuits at a cost of more than $2.9 million in an attempt to put to rest a scandal involving alleged harassment and misconduct by its former chairman.
In one of the cases involving three plaintiffs—Tina McKinnor, the party's former operations director; John Vigna, its former communications director; and Spencer Dayton, an activist—who alleged sexual assault, harassment and racial discrimination, the state Democratic Party is paying more than $1 million to settle, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
In addition, the state party said it has come to a settlement agreement with William Floyd, who alleged he was sexually assaulted by former party Chairman Eric Bauman, who resigned in late 2018, on multiple occasions while serving as his personal assistant.
The party agreed to pay Mr. Floyd $1.75 million but admitted no wrongdoing, according to a settlement agreement reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The third case involved Brendan Stepp, a video editor who had been employed by the party and claimed Mr. Bauman repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances and harassed him. The settlement payment in that case was $150,000, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement.


The U.S., Iraq and Iran
The U.S. strikes in Iraq against Iranian-backed militias and Qasem Soleimani were necessary, but they always risked a nationalist backlash. The Iraqi Parliament's symbolic vote Sunday to oust U.S. troops from the country is an example of that backlash, but it's also far from the last word.
The vote was not decisive, as only a little over half of Iraq's 329 members of parliament were present to vote on the nonbinding resolution. Kataib Hezbollah, the militia allied with Iran's Quds Force that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last week, issued threats against lawmakers who voted against the resolution.
Shiite lawmakers hold a majority and most voted in favor, while Kurdish and most Sunni members didn't show up. Iraq's minorities understand better than anyone the risk of Iranian domination, and both have supported a continuing American military presence.
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi supported the vote, but he's a caretaker who in November promised to resign after widespread protests sapped the legislature's legitimacy. Elections for a new parliament are expected this year. The public already has registered its disgust with the Iraqi ruling class, and no doubt the U.S. and Iranian presence in the country will be major election issues.
The parliament also voted to file a complaint with the United Nations about the strike against Soleimani. Those suddenly concerned about international law apparently weren't worried that Soleimani's presence in Iraq was illegal under a 2007 United Nations Security Council resolution that was still in force. If the terrorist ringleader had adhered to that U.N. travel restriction, he'd still be alive.


U.S. Says Attack in Kenya Kills Three Americans
The U.S. military said that an attack on a shared military base by Somalia's al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab on Sunday killed three Americans, highlighting the threat the Islamist group still poses to the region despite a step up in American airstrikes in recent years.
A U.S. service member and two U.S. military contractors were killed in the attack, the military said. Two U.S. military contractors were also wounded.
The militants launched a predawn strike on Manda Bay Airfield near Kenya's border with Somalia on the Indian Ocean coast, breaching the base that hosts U.S. personnel and destroying vehicles and infrastructure. U.S. forces at the base provide training and support to African partners fighting terrorism and other threats.
The attack is the first al-Shabaab assault against U.S. forces inside Kenya, used by Washington as an important base in the fight against one of the region's most deadly extremist organizations.
The U.S. military said six civilian aircraft were damaged in the attack. Al-Shabaab released footage of militants standing next to aircraft in flames and claimed they had destroyed seven planes and three military vehicles.


Blue State Redistribution
The U.S. population grew last year at the slowest rate since World War I as the birth rate and immigration declined, the Census Bureau reported last week. Slowing population growth will have significant economic and social implications for the country, but especially for high-tax states.
The Census Bureau and IRS last week also released state population growth and income migration data for 2018 that show the exodus from high-tax to low-tax states is accelerating. Four states have lost population since 2010 including West Virginia (-3.3%), Illinois (-1.2%), Vermont (-0.3%) and Connecticut (-0.2%), but 10 experienced declines last year. New York was the biggest loser as a net 180,000 people left for better climes. Over the last decade New York has lost more of its population to other states (7.2%) than any other save Alaska (8%), followed by Illinois (6.8%), Connecticut (5.6%) and New Jersey (5.5%).
Hmmm, what do these states have in common? Large tax burdens and politically powerful public unions. Illinois's property tax rates are the second highest in the country after New Jersey. The state lost $5.6 billion in adjusted gross income last year to other states, about twice as much as in 2012. Notably, income outflow hasn't increased from Michigan or Wisconsin.
Illinois's 4.95% flat income tax is lower than many of its neighbors, but Democrats are pushing a state constitutional amendment on the November ballot for a progressive income tax. Voters should look how that's turned out for other high-tax states.
New York's 12.7% top marginal rate is the second highest in the U.S. In the last two years New York has lost a net $18 billion in adjusted gross income. The wealth exodus is reducing revenue and making it harder to fund programs like Medicaid. As Gov. Andrew Cuomo groused last year, "Tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich. We did that. God forbid the rich leave."


China Reports First Death From New Coronavirus
A new virus implicated in a pneumonia outbreak in central China killed a 61-year-old man there, Chinese health authorities said Saturday.
It was the first death of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been quarantined. Chinese scientists discovered a new strain of coronavirus there this week.
Preliminary investigations found that 41 people in the city of Wuhan had been infected with the strain, the city's health commission said. It said there were no infections found among people in close contact with the infected patients—including medical workers—suggesting that it isn't easily transmittable between humans.
The man who died had been admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and pneumonia, the health commission said, and had other health conditions.
Seven people quarantined in the viral-pneumonia outbreak are in critical condition and eight have been released, the health commission said. Two of those eight people are confirmed to have been infected with the new coronavirus, according to the commission. No new cases have been reported since Jan. 3.


Beijing Dismisses Taiwan Voters' Rebuke Over Its Claims to Island
TAIPEI—An emphatic rebuke from Taiwanese voters against China's authoritarian influence drew disdain in Beijing, prompting some in Taiwan to brace for greater coercive measures from the Communist Party.
Taiwan's leader, President Tsai Ing-wen, secured re-election on Saturday with 57% of the vote and a record tally of nearly 8.2 million ballots—a resounding endorsement of her pitch to defend the island's democratic freedoms against encroachment from China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.
Opinion polls suggest that Ms. Tsai's decisive win stemmed in large part from widespread sympathies for anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong, which energized Taiwanese opposition against China's efforts to cajole and coerce the self-ruled island into accepting unification with the mainland.
Beijing has maintained an implacable face over the result. Its Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated China's commitment to applying to Taiwan the "one country, two systems" formula currently used to govern Hong Kong as a semiautonomous territory—even though protests there against Beijing's growing influence have energized Taiwanese opposition to the proposal.
Such sentiment was instrumental in Ms. Tsai's re-election, lifting her from the political doldrums in late 2018 when her Democratic Progressive Party suffered humiliating losses at local elections amid widespread dissatisfaction over her perceived mishandling of the economy, pension reforms and relations with the mainland.


Iran, Grappling With Unrest Over Crash, Warns Protesters
TEHRAN—Iranian authorities warned protesters not to stage further antigovernment demonstrations, as a video appeared to show security forces using tear gas to contain protests over the weekend.
The demonstrations broke out after the Iranian military on Saturday said it unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner last week, killing all 176 people on board, after denying for days that it was responsible. The protesters denounced what they called lying and incompetence by the country's leadership.
Tehran's metropolitan police chief, Hossein Rahimi, on Monday warned "abusers of the situation" that the country's security forces would zealously defend the security of the Iranian people.
Video shared by the U.S.-based Center for Human Rights in Iran and verified by the Associated Press appeared to show gunshot injuries and tear gas being used against protesters. But Mr. Rahimi denied his forces had opened fire to quell the protests over the weekend, saying they had acted with self-restraint, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported.
A vigil planned by families of the plane-crash victims at Sharif University in Tehran, where 15 of those who were killed in the crash studied, was canceled on Monday because of security concerns, a notice on the university's website said.


Virginia Governor Bans Guns From Capitol Grounds Ahead of Rally
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam temporarily banned firearms from the grounds of the state Capitol in Richmond, citing law-enforcement concerns about weaponized drones and armed militias storming the statehouse during a pro-gun rally planned for Monday.
Police expect thousands of people to turn out to protest gun-control measures being pushed by newly empowered Democratic lawmakers in the state legislature.
Mr. Northam, a Democrat, declared a temporary state of emergency banning all weapons from Capitol Square, the 12-acre grounds that include the columned 18th century statehouse. He said law-enforcement officials are aware of credible threats of potential violence and extremism from out-of-state militia groups and hate groups.
Last week, a state legislative committee banned firearms inside any Capitol Square buildings and any building where lawmakers or their support staff have offices.
"They are real threats, and we are taking them seriously," Mr. Northam said at a news conference Wednesday. He said threats included "armed militia groups storming our Capitol" and the weaponizing of drones. He said individuals had been seen conducting surveillance on Capitol Square looking at entry and exit points.


America's Bad Taste in Beer Is Prohibition's Legacy
America's experiment with alcohol prohibition began Jan. 17, 1920, a year after the ratification of the 18th Amendment. Prohibition—which outlawed the production, sale and supply of "intoxicating liquors" in the U.S.—lasted 13 years, until the ratification of the 21st Amendment on Dec. 5, 1933. And what does the country have to show for it?
Those long, thirsty years changed American tastes, which in turn pushed brewers to make the bland, homogenized beers that have defined the U.S. for decades. Only recently has the craft beer revolution brought back the glorious variety of pre-Prohibition brews, with everything from Pilsners to pale ales.
Even before Prohibition, many states had banned alcohol. Voters in Ohio passed Amendment 2, a ballot measure on prohibition that took effect on May 27, 1919. By 1919, 29 other states had also imposed their own alcohol prohibitions. Yet since Prohibition didn't yet exist at the federal level, people in dry states found it relatively easy to import beer from wet ones. That's one reason why temperance advocates felt they had to push for a constitutional amendment.
In his book "Over-the-Rhine: When Beer Was King," Michael D. Morgan describes the impact of prohibition on Cincinnati's German neighborhood. Alcohol vendors weren't the only ones to feel the effects. The local economy buckled under "the indirect loss of jobs in grain and hop storage, cooperage and related industries; as well as the loss of significant tax revenue, the impact on land values must have also been dramatic."
In 1919 there were 669 breweries in the U.S. Many closed their doors during Prohibition, but others found inventive ways to stay open. Olt Brother's Brewing Co. in Dayton, Ohio, started producing cereal beverages, cream and buttermilk, among other products. Toledo's Buckeye Brewery churned out soft drinks such as ginger ale and root beer.


Russia's Rise on the Global Stage
MOSCOW—Vladimir Putin's efforts to reassert Moscow's global influence appear to be bearing some fruit. But 20 years after he first assumed the Russian presidency, his efforts to revitalize the country's economy have languished.
Mr. Putin recently proposed changes to Russia's constitution that he could use to retain his grip on power, perhaps in a new role to tend to his legacy from behind the scenes. As he ushers in a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, he will be sure to try to maintain tight control, analysts say.
Meanwhile, as questions mount about America's role around the world, he is also likely to see to it that Russian military forays into the Middle East, extension of energy pipelines to strategic neighbors, and increasingly assertive foreign policy overall continue as well.
Moscow, in keeping with its long-term goal of returning to superpower status, has consolidated its military presence in Syria, where it was the deciding factor in winning the war for President Bashar al-Assad. Irregular Russian mercenary groups in Libya, the Central African Republic and possibly Venezuela also give the Kremlin tools to operate in the shadows abroad.
In China and Europe, Russia uses its oil and natural-gas reserves to improve ties. The Power of Siberia gas pipeline to China has been open since last year, and Moscow is using the Nord Stream 2 project, a natural-gas line being laid from Russia to Germany beneath the Baltic Sea, as a lever to try to improve relations with Europe's biggest economy.


Pelosi Knows Impeachment Is Weak
Compelling, overwhelming and bipartisan: These are the criteria Speaker Nancy Pelosi drew as she publicly announced last March that she wouldn't support impeachment. Back then she claimed impeaching the president with anything less would be divisive and irresponsible. Ten months later, however, Mrs. Pelosi has transmitted two articles of impeachment that fail to meet any of her criteria, let alone those of the Founders.
As the Senate considers how to fulfill its constitutional role, Mrs. Pelosi's words from March ring true. An impeachment supported by only one party is a failure. Refusing to proceed in a bipartisan manner reveals the Democrats' lack of thoroughness and seriousness and, above all, their lack of compelling evidence. This impeachment is antithetical to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and, as the speaker would have agreed until recently, deeply damaging to the country.
Whether Democrats accept it or not, the House's primary role in this matter is now complete. One hundred senators now hold the president's fate. They should refuse to accept the House Democrats' sham process. The articles of impeachment before the Senate warrant not only acquittal of the president, but also the Senate's absolute rejection of the dangerous precedent that has already been set.
Since the day Donald Trump was elected, House Democrats have sought to trigger the nuclear option by removing a duly elected president from office, an action never completed in U.S. history. Democrats claim Mr. Trump represents a continuing threat to American democracy. In the name of urgency, Democrats ram-rodded their impeachment case through the House. Yet for nearly a month, Mrs. Pelosi wouldn't stand behind her own caucus. She refused to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial, belying Democrats' supposed fear of an imminent threat. She waited because she knew House Democrats ran a sham process and have no substantive case to pass on to the Senate.
The House's duty in impeachment is to build the case for removal by questioning witnesses and gathering evidence. But House Democrats were unwilling to spend the time to conduct a thorough and fair investigation. The result is a case, as liberal law professor Jonathan Turley testified, with "one of the thinnest records to ever go forward on impeachment."


Thousands of Pro-Gun Advocates  Rally in Virginia
RICHMOND, Va.—Thousands of pro-gun demonstrators gathered peacefully around the state Capitol to protest proposed firearm restrictions, with officials relieved that the event failed to attract extremist groups or inspire violence.
Attendees held American flags and banners that read "Come and Take It" alongside images of firearms. Some chanted into bullhorns, "We will not comply" and "U.S.A." Others wore stickers that said "Guns save lives."
Authorities estimated about 22,000 people showed up Monday, about 6,000 of whom passed through airport-style security screening for an hour-long rally in a fenced-off area in front of the Capitol. The other 16,000 people, some with military-style rifles, stood outside the area on city streets where guns were allowed.
There were security fears leading up to the event, including what Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam said were credible threats of potential violence from out-of-state militia and hate groups. Federal authorities last week arrested three suspected members of a white-supremacist group who had discussed opening fire at the rally, law-enforcement officials said.
"It was a perfect day. Not only the weather was perfect, there was no violence. I didn't expect any from our side, but we didn't know about all these groups that said they were going to piggyback onto our rally," said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, which organized the event.


Repeal and Replace the War Powers Resolution
The U.S. military strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran's deadly Quds Force, has reignited the debate about war powers.
The U.S. Supreme Court has been reluctant to decide what it considers a political dispute between the two other coequal branches of government: Congress and the presidency. As a result, there is a continuing controversy regarding which branch has the final say when it comes to the exercise of military power—Congress and its Article I constitutional authority to declare war or the presidency and its Article II authority as commander in chief.
The War Powers Resolution of 1973, passed over President Richard Nixon's veto during the Watergate scandal, was intended to bring clarity. The law allows the president to send military forces into any conflict in which Congress has declared war or provided "statutory authorization," or in cases in which an attack on the U.S. occasions a "national emergency." But this law, which presidents from both parties have deemed unconstitutional, tends to be honored more in the breach than the observance. Congress last declared war on June 4, 1942, against Nazi allies Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Since then, more than 100,000 Americans have died in undeclared wars around the world.
That was the conundrum that the bipartisan National War Powers Commission, which I co-chaired in 2008 with former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, sought to address. Given the Supreme Court's understandable reluctance to resolve the constitutional questions that dominate the debate over war powers, the commission recommended that Congress replace the toothless 1973 resolution with a War Powers Consultation Act. The proposal would:
• Provide that the president shall consult with Congress before deploying U.S. troops into "significant armed conflict"—i.e., combat operations lasting, or expected to last, more than a week.


What Has Happened Since House Vote to Impeach
WASHINGTON—Nearly a month passed between the House vote to impeach President Trump and its transmission of the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
In that time, Democrats say, new information has raised the need for additional documents to be subpoenaed and witnesses called, which senators will vote on after the trial begins. Mr. Trump's legal team argues the articles of impeachment are frivolous and dangerous and should be swiftly rejected by the Senate.
Here's what has happened since the House vote:
Giuliani associate makes a splash
Lev Parnas, who assisted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in his push for the Ukrainian investigations, in recent weeks turned over documents to the House Intelligence Committee that reveal new details about the extent of their efforts.


Schools Took Away Students' Phones. Now They're Treating Separation Anxiety
Before class each day, a high-school teacher in Indianapolis grabs a clear plastic bag and fastens it to her waist with a ribbon. The homemade pouch is a repository for phones that are either confiscated or handed over voluntarily by students who don't want to be tempted to tap or swipe during class.
She calls it the "phoney pack," and the magic of the makeshift vault isn't that it keeps devices out of reach. It's that it lowers students' anxiety by keeping their phones in view.
Smartphones have long been a scourge for teachers and administrators, who have employed a range of strict measures to keep them out of the classroom. But it turns out that getting rid of phones introduced another distraction: withdrawal pangs.
Now, teachers across the country are testing their own methods for managing their students' phone-related angst. Some use lockable pouches that let students hold their phones rather than having to leave them alone in their lockers. Others have set up charging stations in classrooms, betting that the visibility and value of a charge will keep students at ease. Then there are the teachers who have decided dangling extra credit and other prizes is the best defense against phone withdrawal.
Students don't always appreciate the efforts to appease them.


Brazilian Prosecutors Charge U.S. Journalist Greenwald With Cybercrime
SÃO PAULO—Brazilian prosecutors on Tuesday charged the American journalist and activist Glenn Greenwald with cybercrimes related to the hacking of Justice Minister Sergio Moro's cellphone last year, raising concerns about press freedoms in Latin America's largest democracy.
Federal prosecutors say Mr. Greenwald, who co-founded The Intercept news site and lives in Rio de Janeiro, encouraged a group of hackers to invade the cellphone and online accounts of Mr. Moro to obtain messages from the minister's time as a judge trying cases stemming from an investigation into former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The messages between Mr. Moro and prosecutors, which the Intercept published last year, appeared to show the judge to be improperly guiding the investigation.
Six alleged hackers were also charged on Tuesday. Prosecutors said Mr. Greenwald was in contact with them while they were carrying out illegal hacking activities and advised them to delete information that they had provided for the Intercept stories.
Mr. Greenwald denied wrongdoing and said he would fight the charges, which he characterized as a threat to press freedom. "To include me in the charges with the hackers is astonishing," he said.
The journalist said he has recordings of his talks with the sources to prove he did nothing wrong, adding he told at least one of them there was no need to keep copies since he had his own backup recordings.


New York Court Rules Prosecutorial Misconduct Commission Unconstitutional
A New York State Supreme Court judge on Tuesday declared a commission on prosecutorial misconduct unconstitutional, handing district attorneys a victory and dealing a blow to supporters of a panel that would have been the country's first.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law in March, creating an 11-member panel to investigate potentially unethical behavior by state prosecutors and impose any necessary sanctions. The statute was thereafter challenged by a coalition of district attorneys who alleged it violated the separation of powers between the state's three branches of government.
In a 63-page decision, Justice David A. Weinstein of Albany held Tuesday that statute was "inconsistent with the provisions of the New York State Constitution."
Critics of the commission had voiced concerns that its broad investigatory power could interfere with the decision making of prosecutors—who are independently elected—and put a chill on their investigative work.
"The court eloquently explained what we and our clients have been arguing for over a year: the Commission on Prosecutorial Conduct and its enabling statute are unconstitutional," attorney Jim Walden, a member of the legal team representing the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York said. Prosecutors statewide "will be able to do their jobs without the constant threat of unconstitutional oversight," he added.


Palestinians Reject Middle East Peace Plan
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the Trump administration's Middle East peace plan shortly after it was unveiled on Tuesday, saying a Palestinian state without Jerusalem was impossible.
"We say a thousand times, no, no, no to the deal of the century," Mr. Abbas said, in a reference to the peace accord President Trump hoped to broker. "We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct."
Even before the long-awaited proposal was announced in Washington, tense U.S. relations with the Palestinians had thrown into doubt Mr. Trump's efforts to bridge the differences with the Israelis.
Protests organized by Palestinian leadership began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Tuesday, before the plan was released. Some protesters clashed with Israeli security forces in the West Bank and carried signs saying "down with the deal of the century."
In anticipation that the plan would strongly favor the Israelis, the Palestinian Authority has threatened to cut its security and economic relations with Israel formed in previous peace talks.


Former Ukraine Ambassador Yovanovitch Retires
Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post in May 2019 and testified as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has retired from the State Department, according to a person familiar with her decision.
Friday was her final day as a department employee, according to the person, who said that Ms. Yovanovitch retired, and didn't resign.
Ms. Yovanovitch didn't immediately respond to a request for comment made through her attorney.
A career diplomat, Ms. Yovanovitch was the top U.S. representative in Kyiv from 2016 until her dismissal last spring. Upon her return to Washington, she joined Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service as a senior State Department fellow.
She had held senior posts abroad and in Washington, serving as ambassador to Armenia from 2008 to 2011 and to the Kyrgyz Republic from 2005 to 2008. Before her tour in Kyiv, Ms. Yovanovitch served as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs.


Trump's Impeachment Is Virtually Over. What Did It Change?
No experience as searing as a presidential impeachment trial—dramatic, emotional and seen only twice before in American history—can end without leaving lasting marks.
That will be the case in the aftermath of President Trump's Senate trial, which now is virtually certain to end with a decisive and largely partisan acquittal on Wednesday. The reverberations will roll out for years to come, affecting the state of presidential power, the national political climate and the byplay between the two parties in Washington.
1. It is Trump's party now
Perhaps most important, the impeachment drama has further shifted ground within the Republican party. Contrary to some expectations, impeachment drove Republican leaders even further into the embrace of a president they once viewed skeptically. By uniting so decisively behind Mr. Trump, Republicans find their fortunes locked with his, for better or as Democrats claim for the worse, in this year's election season.
For his part, Mr. Trump found himself dependent on a Republican establishment he once scorned, and ultimately became proud of its solid backing. If there was doubt before that the Republican party has become Mr. Trump's party, it has largely evaporated during the impeachment fight.
2. The country is even more polarized
The fight has driven the polarization already rampant in America's political system even deeper into the body politic. Unlike past impeachment debates over Presidents Nixon and Clinton, this one uncovered little to no common ground between the two parties.


Race Moves to New Hampshire as Iowa Remains in Flux
LACONIA, N.H.—Democratic presidential candidates arrived in New Hampshire with busy campaign schedules but locked in a race denied any clear sense of direction by the caucus problems in Iowa.
As the Iowa Democratic Party began releasing results late Tuesday, people in line for a Pete Buttigieg town hall in central New Hampshire were live-streaming cable news on their phones. One man yelled, "We won," as the initial tallies showed the former South Bend, Ind., mayor in the lead.
At Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's morning event in Keene, voters predicted the confusion from Monday night in Iowa would focus even more attention on the nation's first voting primary.
"Everyone's eyes are here now," said Christine Hansen, a 64-year-old retired physical-therapy assistant.
Mr. Buttigieg had told supporters as he arrived in the state early Tuesday that he was optimistic about his results in Iowa—and his chances in New Hampshire. Four-term Nashua, N.H., Mayor Jim Donchess endorsed Mr. Buttigieg on Tuesday morning, saying mayors "get results."


Notable & Quotable: McConnell on Impeachment
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before the final impeachment vote on Feb. 5:
It insults the intelligence of the American people to pretend this was a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid. No, Washington Democrats' position on this president has been clear for years. Their position was obvious when they openly rooted for the Mueller investigation to tear our country apart and were disappointed when the facts proved otherwise. It was obvious when they sought to impeach this president over and over. Here's their real position: Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a "high crime or misdemeanor" the moment he defeated Secretary Clinton in the 2016 election.
That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost. Ever since, the nation has suffered through a grinding campaign against our norms and institutions from the same people who keep shouting that our norms and institutions need defending. A campaign to degrade our democracy and delegitimize our elections from the same people who shout that confidence in our democracy must be paramount.
We have watched a major American political party adopt the following absurd proposition: We think this president is a bull in a china shop, so we're going to drive a bulldozer through the china shop to get rid of him.


Ajit Pai's Satellite Mission
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has been battling rent-seekers and politicians to free up more broadband spectrum for 5G. On Thursday he proposed a compromise to repurpose satellite spectrum that could accelerate 5G by years—if only Republican politicians would now stand down.
The FCC has been auctioning millimeter and low-band spectrum that can alternately carry large loads of information or cover large geographic areas. But mobile providers need more mid-band spectrum that does both. Thus Mr. Pai in 2017 proposed reallocating some so-called C-band spectrum that satellite companies currently use to beam video and radio content to broadcasters.
Satellite operators volunteered to sell their spectrum, but cable companies and some Republicans objected. Cable companies worry about increased competition if wireless providers get their hands on more mid-band. GOP Senators such as Louisiana's John Kennedy declared foreign satellite operators should not be allowed to profit from selling government spectrum.
Bowing to political pressure, Mr. Pai in November announced the government would auction the spectrum itself. While Section 316 of the Communications Act allows the FCC to modify a spectrum license if such "action will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity," satellite companies threatened to sue, and litigation could delay 5G buildout for years.
Confiscating satellite operators' airwaves would also set a terrible precedent that might devalue spectrum licenses and reduce the amount of money the government raises at future auctions. The Trump Administration has criticized China for ignoring the property rights of foreign companies to promote Beijing's objectives, but the U.S. would be doing the same.
Credit to Mr. Pai, who is now threading the needle by offering satellite operators from $3 billion to $5 billion to cover the technical costs of freeing up their spectrum, plus up to $9.7 billion if they meet the FCC's timeline. This would compensate satellite providers for their spectrum at a reasonable cost and give them an incentive to hand it over quickly.
Mr. Pai wants to start the auction in December, and his plan could rake in $15 billion to $17 billion for the Treasury. Yet Senate Republicans have proposed legislation that would compensate satellite operators as little as $1 billion for the spectrum so the government can spend billions more on rural broadband. Satellite operators won't vacate their spectrum at that rate.
Earth to Republicans—Mr. Pai's plan would launch 5G in rural America faster.


Child Allegedly Sexually Assaulted on U.S. Embassy Grounds in India
NEW DELHI—The 5-year-old daughter of a local employee of the U.S. Embassy in India was allegedly sexually assaulted in a residential facility for Indian staff on the embassy grounds, according to local police.
The alleged assault occurred on Saturday and was reported by the child's mother to police on Sunday. Police said a medical examination revealed evidence of an assault. A 25-year-old son of another local embassy employee who lives in the same compound was arrested and remains in custody, police said Thursday.
A State Department spokeswoman said that U.S. Embassy officials in New Delhi were "deeply disturbed to learn of allegations of a sexual assault of a child" on the Embassy compound.
"The Embassy took prompt action, including reporting the incident to the police and assisting the alleged victim obtain medical assistance," the spokeswoman said. "We are cooperating with the Indian-led investigation. We extend our sympathy and full support to the child and her family."
It couldn't be determined whether the arrested man, who wasn't available for comment, has legal representation.


Notable & Quotable: Acquitted
President Trump, speaking to supporters in the White House, Feb. 6:
We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. . . . It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey, who was a disaster, by the way, it's possible I wouldn't even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops. Bad people. If this happened to President Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already. Many, many years. . . .
This is a political thing, and every time I say this is unfair, let's go to court, they say, "Sir, you can't go to court, this is politics." And we were treated unbelievably unfairly, and you have to understand we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. . . . .
We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. It was nasty in both the primaries and the election. We thought after the election it would stop, but it didn't stop. It just started. Tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. So we had a campaign. Little did we know we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible, dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it. The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. . . .


Amazon Seeks to Question Trump Over Pentagon Contract
WASHINGTON— Amazon.com Inc. asked a judge to allow it to depose President Trump in the company's legal battle to overturn a Pentagon decision awarding a huge cloud-computing contract to rival Microsoft Corp.
The Amazon motion, made public Monday, says that Mr. Trump's bias against Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos "is a matter of public record. Even before taking office, President Trump campaigned on a promise that Amazon would 'have problems' if he became President."
The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department said it "remains confident in the JEDI award. Our team's duty and sole focus must remain on equipping our warfighters for an increasingly complex and challenging battlefield environment."
The Pentagon previously has said the "selection decision was made by an expert team of career public servants and military officers from across the Department of Defense and in accordance with DOD's normal source-selection process." The contract is valued at as much as $10 billion over the next decade.
It isn't uncommon for litigants to seek to depose top government officials including the president. But courts don't automatically grant those requests, and it appeared likely the administration would resist. Deposing a cabinet-level or higher federal official in a civil suit is a comparatively rare event.


Fannie and Freddie Remain a Risk to Federal Taxpayers
Chuck Mansfield writes: "Fannie and Freddie had overextended themselves and were facing dire financial consequences" ("Legislators and Regulators Failed in 2007," Letters, Feb. 6). Fannie and Freddie did finally fail, which led to the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression. Congress created a new independent federal housing agency to supervise them. Unfortunately, with Wall Street's encouragement in September 2019, President Trump proposed "returning" Fannie and Freddie to the private market with a government "guarantee" (The old Fannie and Freddie had just an implicit federal backstop.) So we might repeat the financial market crash of 2008, but Wall Street will be able to shift the ultimate credit risk to the taxpayer.
Francis X, Cavanaugh
Washington
Mr. Cavanaugh was the first chief executive of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (1986-1993).


Harvey Weinstein's Attorney Argues for Acquittal
Harvey Weinstein's defense team on Thursday asked a Manhattan jury to find the Hollywood producer not guilty of sex crimes, saying his actions might not have been respectable, but they were always consensual.
"You don't have to like Mr. Weinstein," lead attorney Donna Rotunno told jurors. "You have to remember we are not here to criminalize morality, and thank God."
The four-hour closing argument was among the final chapters in a six-week trial that is the most prominent test of the #MeToo movement playing out in the justice system. Allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted dozens of women helped set off a cascade of accusations that permeated the highest levels of business and politics, resulting in a debate over how women are treated in professional and private spheres.
Ms. Rotunno has cast Mr. Weinstein's accusers as professional climbers who used sex with Mr. Weinstein to get ahead. On Thursday, she called prosecutors overzealous and quick to play into a cultural moment, calling them "producers" who were "writing the script" in which women attend parties, flirt with men and make choices to advance their careers without consequence.
"They created a universe that strips from women common sense, autonomy and responsibility," she said of prosecutors. "Women have choices."


U.S. Passengers Depart Cruise Ship Quarantined Over Coronavirus
TOKYO—American passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship departed from a Tokyo airport early Monday on flights home that the U.S. government arranged after a high-level political push in Washington.
Buses carried the Americans from the ship, the site of the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside China, to Haneda airport, where they boarded two charter flights organized by the State Department. The Defense Department said one plane would go to Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., and the other would land at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
The Americans spent nearly two weeks in quarantine aboard the cruise ship and must serve out an additional 14-day quarantine after arriving in the U.S.
About 380 Americans and family members of Americans were on board the ship when the quarantine started Feb. 5. Some later tested positive for the novel coronavirus and were brought to hospitals across the Tokyo region.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health infectious diseases institute, said on Sunday before the flights took off that 40 Americans from the ship had been infected.


Democratic Candidates Sharpen Criticisms of Bloomberg
LAS VEGAS—Democratic presidential candidates are sharpening their criticism of high-spending rival Michael Bloomberg, saying that the billionaire former New York City mayor would fail to mobilize the party in a potential matchup against President Trump in November.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is seeking to build on his early-state success with a victory in this week's Nevada caucuses, said at a Saturday night dinner in Las Vegas that Mr. Bloomberg's past views on law enforcement and economic issues would hinder the party's chances of defeating the president.
"Regardless of how much money a multibillionaire candidate is willing to spend on his election," Mr. Sanders said, "we will not create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued, advocated for and enacted racist policies like stop-and-frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear."
Mr. Sanders was referring to the practice in which police officers in New York were given broad authority to stop and search people whom they suspected of criminal behavior. Mr. Bloomberg aggressively defended stop-and-frisk for years as vital to public safety, even as opposition among voters and legal challenges to the practice mushroomed in New York because the effects fell overwhelmingly on black and Latino residents.
Mr. Bloomberg apologized for his administration's use of the tactic in November, the same month he officially launched his presidential campaign. But he had previously been a vigorous proponent, defending stop-and-frisk as recently as January 2019. Mr. Bloomberg expressed regret last week when audio of him defending the procedure in 2015 was shared on social media. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in federal court in 2013.


Sanders, Bloomberg Offer Differing Theories of Democratic Desires
To say that Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg are different is one of those statements that is at once both entirely true, yet woefully insufficient.
For all the differences that separate the Vermont senator and the former New York mayor, though, the most profound one is very simple: They offer divergent theories of what the 2020 presidential election is all about. Mr. Sanders believes Democratic voters are ready to overthrow the system. Mr. Bloomberg thinks they merely want to overthrow President Trump.
The question of which approach Democrats are buying is central to the fate of these two unconventional candidates, and to the whole scrambled Democratic presidential race.
One of the most important aspects of any presidential campaign is the theory of the race: What is it that voters are really looking for that year? Ronald Reagan won in 1980 because voters were ready, after an ineffective Democratic presidency, for a turn in a conservative direction. Barack Obama won in 2008 because voters were seeking, in the midst of a deep financial slide and a depressing war in Iraq, a candidate who represented both hope and change. Donald Trump won in 2016 because voters wanted somebody who would defy the establishment of both parties.
This year, the Democratic primary fight turns on the question of what the party's rank-and-file are most yearning for: a genuine revolution, or a simple change in command.


New Jersey Governor Proposes Antiharassment Legislation
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is proposing legislation to better protect workers from harassment and discrimination, even as he defends against allegations about his own campaign.
Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said Tuesday that he wants to allow domestic workers and unpaid interns to file discrimination lawsuits and extend the statute of limitations for all such complaints to three years from two. His proposed legislation would also require all public and private employers to provide antidiscrimination and antiharassment training.
"The behavior we are targeting has gone on way too long," Mr. Murphy said at a news conference in Trenton. "It has been our intention from the very beginning to set the highest expectations and standards for treating all with dignity and respect."
The proposals are the result of a review that the governor initiated in 2018 after Katie Brennan, a former volunteer for his campaign, told The Wall Street Journal that his transition team and administration didn't do enough to address her repeated complaints that she had been sexually assaulted by a campaign staffer.
More recently, Mr. Murphy has pushed back against criticism from Julie Roginsky, one of his top former consultants, who said his campaign was a toxic and misogynistic workplace. Mr. Murphy, who took office in January 2018 and is now chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said his campaign thoroughly investigated all complaints it received.


Democrats Prepare for the Big Test
Presidential nomination candidates are continually tested. But not all tests are graded equally. The ones coming up in Nevada this Saturday, South Carolina the next, and 14 other states plus American Samoa on Super Tuesday, March 3, could be enough to determine the Democratic nominee and the next occupant of the Oval Office.
The most important test will be in South Carolina. Will black Democrats send Joe Biden roaring into Super Tuesday with a win, or doom his candidacy by defecting?
Mike Bloomberg's strategy—skipping the first four contests and burying the competition under a mountain of cash come Super Tuesday—will also be tested. The former New York mayor's team has warned other moderate candidates that by staying in the race, they'll "propel Sanders to a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead." Mr. Bloomberg has reason to worry: After spending more than $400 million on advertising, he's at only 16.5% and second place in California in the RealClearPolitics polling average, 11.7% and fourth in Texas, and 17.3% and third in North Carolina.
It's also worth keeping an eye on other, less obvious but still consequential tests. One is how much influence former Sen. Harry Reid has in Nevada. The former amateur boxer and Senate majority leader is retired and ailing but remains the Silver State's Democratic heavyweight. This past Friday Rep. Steven Horsford, Nevada's only black congressman, backed Mr. Biden, only three days after the former vice president took a gut punch in New Hampshire. This was an important get for Mr. Biden, and it's hard to believe Mr. Horsford endorsed without being encouraged by his mentor, Mr. Reid.
The following day, in a wheelchair and showing the effects of cancer treatments, Mr. Reid cast an early ballot. He then talked to reporters—his real purpose in surfacing publicly—and praised Amy Klobuchar's debate performances, spoke cautiously about Bernie Sanders and, after admitting there were valid criticisms of Mr. Bloomberg, labeled him a "good mayor."


Iran Elections Come Amid Tensions at Home and Abroad
TEHRAN—Iran's leadership is pushing for a high turnout at Friday's parliamentary elections, as conservatives seek to consolidate power in the face of mounting economic challenges at home and worsening tensions with the U.S.
Many Iranians are threatening to boycott the vote after a large number of moderate and reformist candidates were disqualified, with some expressing frustration over the legislature's failure to address concerns such as the country's flagging economy or strict Islamic laws.
"I won't be part of the show as long as I can't see my favorite candidate who I genuinely support and believe in. I won't choose between bad and worse anymore," said a 53-year-old homemaker here in the capital.
Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, elections have been an important way for Iran's establishment to build consensus at home and create an outward display of strength, said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London think tank. Among its other tasks, the legislature passes laws and can challenge government policy, in addition to impeaching ministers.
"The fact that Iran has elections, albeit managed ones, is used to demonstrate that the Islamic Republic is more legitimate than other countries in the region," she said.


VA Secretary Under Investigation for Handling of Sexual-Assault Case
The Department of Veterans Affairs' internal watchdog has launched an investigation into allegations that Secretary Robert Wilkie attempted to discredit a woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted at a department medical center, the department's inspector general said Thursday.
Earlier this month, the House Committee on Veterans Affairs asked Michael Missal, the VA's inspector general, to look into allegations that Mr. Wilkie and senior VA officials attempted to gather potentially damaging information about the woman in an effort to discredit her claims. A group of senators sent a similar letter to the inspector general soon afterward.
"This matter is a high priority for our office," Mr. Missal wrote to lawmakers including Rep. Mark Takano (D., Calif.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.).
In September, a House VA committee staff member and Navy veteran, Andrea Goldstein, said she had been assaulted while visiting the Washington VA medical center. Since then she has written publicly about the allegations and the department's handling of the matter.
Lawmakers received reports that Mr. Wilkie allegedly attempted to gather information to discredit Ms. Goldstein, handling the matter outside of official channels. Mr. Wilkie has said he made no such inquiries.


Can Biden Recover in South Carolina?
Charleston, S.C.
Pastor Jeannette Harley, a small, bespectacled woman wearing a bright-green dress, began the function by leading the crowd in a praise chorus based on Exodus 15:26: "I am the God that healeth thee." As the mostly African-American crowd took over the chorus, Ms. Harley punctuated the lines by pointing upward and shouting names of diseases God can heal: "High blood pressure! Acid reflux! Ulcer in the stomach!"
About a minute in, she looked to the side and asked, "Is he ready?" She meant Tom Steyer, the billionaire former hedge-fund manager running for the Democratic presidential nomination. He had arrived late to the Family Worship Center in the tiny town of Yemassee, S.C.
When he appeared at last—black jeans with multicolored belt, wrinkled button-down shirt with customary red tartan tie—Mr. Steyer took the microphone and launched into a recitation of his humble origins. "I know people in the press describe me as a rich person," he said, but that doesn't tell the story. "My mom was a teacher in the public schools of New York. . . . She was not a fancy person."
Mr. Steyer cultivates the image of a righteous bruiser. He speaks quickly, with a determined tone and gravelly voice, as if impatient to batter an opponent. "I had no idea Tom Steyer was so mean," he proudly recalls an opponent saying. He speaks often of the need to "break" corporations. In Yemassee he expressed disbelief that anybody wants to compromise with the GOP. "When people say they know how to get along with Republicans, I'm like, 'How?' When was the last time someone got along with a Republican in a positive way?"


Court Keeps Ex-Arizona Sheriff's Conviction, Citing Pardon
PHOENIX—An appeals court has denied former Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio's bid to erase his criminal conviction for disobeying a 2011 court order, saying President Trump's pardon makes it unnecessary.
Mr. Arpaio was convicted for disobeying an order barring his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.
Mr. Arpaio, who was defeated for reelection in 2016 after six terms, had argued the misdemeanor contempt of court conviction should be removed from his record so it can't be raised against him in future court cases. The 87-year-old lawman, who is running for sheriff again this year, called the decision a victory.
A 2017 lower court decision also said Mr. Trump's pardon removed his possible punishments and that pardons don't erase convictions or the facts of cases.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday rejected Mr. Arpaio's request, saying the verdict no longer has any legal consequence because of the pardon. The judges explained Mr. Arpaio was pardoned before he could be sentenced and that the final judgment in the case ended up dismissing the contempt charge.


Whistleblower Says Federal Employees Flown From Coronavirus Sites Didn't Follow Safety Protocols
WASHINGTON—A whistleblower alleges that some federal employees were sent to work at coronavirus quarantine locations in California without adequate safety protocols and then flew back home on commercial airplanes, according to a person familiar with the complaint against the Department of Health and Human Services.
The complaint, which HHS said it was evaluating, focuses on some employees who work at the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, an HHS division that handles programs such as Head Start and disaster emergency response and that performed functions at some of the quarantine camps.
The U.S. repatriated Americans from China on planes chartered by the State Department in early February. They were subject to 14-day quarantines.
Employees didn't receive prior safety training relevant to the California assignment, the whistleblower alleges, according to the person familiar with the complaint. The employee who filed the complaint said she declined to go to one of the quarantine sites and was then reassigned for raising concerns about employee safety, according to the person familiar with the complaint.
The employees weren't tested for the coronavirus before they left two California quarantine sites, the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside and Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and flew home, the person familiar with the complaint said. There is no evidence that any of the workers contracted or spread the virus.


Mexico Confirms First Case of Coronavirus
MEXICO CITY—Mexico confirmed Friday its first case of a person infected with the coronavirus, becoming the second country in Latin America after Brazil to report the presence of the virus.
Deputy Health Minister Hugo López-Gatell said the person diagnosed with the virus was placed in isolation along with several family members at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City.
The patient, a 35-year-old male, is only mildly ill with coldlike symptoms, Mr. López-Gatell said at a press conference. The quarantine is for epidemiological reasons, as the person affected wouldn't need to be hospitalized for medical reasons, he added.
The virus was also detected by state health authorities in a second person, a 41-year-old man in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa. Samples were sent to the government's epidemiology institute Friday for corroboration, although the case is being treated as confirmed, Mr. López-Gatell said. Both people visited Italy in the third week of February, where they probably contracted the virus, he added.
Two other suspected cases are under observation in Mexico City and central Mexico state.


FDA to Allow Labs to Begin Use of High-Complexity Tests for Coronavirus
The Food and Drug Administration said Saturday that it will allow hundreds of U.S academic hospital labs to immediately begin testing for the novel coronavirus.
The move by the federal agency means that the nation will become able virtually overnight to test thousands of patients rather than the few hundred tested so far for the virus, known as Covid-19.
"We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public-health emergency," FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn said in a statement. "We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the U.S. We are not changing our standards for issuing Emergency Use Authorizations."
President Trump announced a news conference on coronavirus Saturday afternoon.
The FDA said the new policy is for certain laboratories that develop and begin to use validated Covid-19 diagnostics before the FDA has completed review of their Emergency Use Authorization requests.


U.S. Orders Cap on Chinese State Media Personnel
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is ordering China's major state media companies to sharply reduce the ranks of Chinese nationals in the U.S. in retaliation for years of tightening restrictions on American news outlets by Beijing.
State Department officials said Monday that a personnel cap is being imposed on four Chinese media companies, forcing them to reduce their Chinese employees in the U.S. to 100 in total, from 160.
The companies targeted—Xinhua News Agency, China Radio International, China Global Television Network and China Daily—must comply with the new limits by March 13, the officials said. Those outlets purvey Chinese government views, and the State Department last month said their U.S. operations will be subject to the rules for representatives of a foreign government, not treated as independent news media.
The Trump administration has adopted a get-tough policy toward Beijing, using tariffs, investment reviews and other tools as punishment for what it sees as a lack of reciprocity in its treatment of American businesses, products and, now, news organizations.
In announcing the new cap, the State Department officials cited "a longstanding, negative trend" in Beijing's treatment of foreign journalists.


Trump Needs to Walk Fine Line as Coronavirus Messenger
WASHINGTON—President Trump relishes being the communicator-in-chief. With coronavirus, he has met one of his toughest messaging challenges yet.
As the virus spreads in the U.S., Mr. Trump is seeking to play the traditional presidential role of using his platform to disseminate facts and reassure the public during a crisis. But he has at times seemed to muddle the administration's message by minimizing risks and dispensing information that was incorrect or contradicted by other officials.
"While everything is political in Washington, you have to in times like this, you have to divorce the politics from the policy, knowing that in the end if you get it right there will be political benefit," said Joe Lockhart, former press secretary to President Clinton. "He's been downplaying the risk of this in a way that's unrealistic."
Over the past week, Mr. Trump has sought to urge calm as the financial markets have whipsawed. He has also worked to clarify a chaotic response, putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the virus effort and seeking to streamline messaging. He has appeared twice in the White House briefing room, stressing that the number of documented cases has been low and that the U.S. government response has been robust.
On Monday Mr. Trump met with pharmaceutical executives at the White House, discussing the timelines to develop vaccines and therapies for the virus, pushing for speedy results. "My administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to protect our citizens," he declared.


The Force Unifying Democrats? It's Donald Trump
Nobody unites the Democratic Party the way Donald Trump does.
That was the overriding lesson of a stunning Super Tuesday and the Lazarus-like rise from the dead staged by former Vice President Joe Biden. The surprising results—he won 10 of 14 states—revealed some important markers: an enduring affection for Mr. Biden among rank-and-file Democrats, the power of the African-American vote, the width of the party's moderate wing.
But most of all, the results showed that Democratic voters are carrying into the polling booth a coldblooded desire to beat the president. In state after state, exit polls showed voters put more stock in picking a candidate who can beat the president than in choosing one who shares their views—and in state after state, Mr. Biden was seen as that candidate.
Yes, most Democrats love Uncle Joe, but they also see his flaws. They simply were willing to look past those flaws once his convincing win in South Carolina last weekend revived the idea he could win in the fall.
The party's leaders rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, as have three former foes, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and, as of Wednesday morning, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But more important than the leadership was the party's followership, which did the same. It is often said that Democrats fall in love with candidates, while Republicans fall in line. This week presents a picture of Democrats falling in line.


The World's Hardest Job
President Trump dumped acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney late Friday evening in favor of North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, who will be the fourth White House chief of his Presidency. By now Mr. Trump's handling of his leading aides resembles the way Henry VIII treated his wives. He's enthusiastic at first, then sours on them for reasons known only to the President, and the next thing you know the guy is banished to Northern Ireland.
That's where Mr. Mulvaney is going as a special envoy, a slot the White House was trying to fill for some time. It's doubtful Mr. Mulvaney was yearning for this opportunity.
Tumult in this White House is no surprise, and Presidents are entitled to the advisers they want. Mr. Trump is effectively his own chief of staff, he hates to be tied to a daily schedule, and he likes to keep his advisers on edge about their jobs. He never removed Mr. Mulvaney's "acting" title despite 80-hour workweeks serving a difficult client.
Cabinet members live in fear of appearing to have a sliver of public difference with Mr. Trump on any issue lest they become persona non grata. Appearing to upstage the President, however unintentionally, can be fatal. Mr. Trump has also had four national security advisers in three years because he thinks of himself as his own chief strategist.
Mr. Trump's partisans are saying the staff change is part of his preparation for the election campaign. But it's hardly reassuring to the public to sack the chief White House aide in the middle of the coronavirus epidemic. It plays into Joe Biden's campaign theme, which is essentially to stop the turmoil emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.


Where Do the Candidates Stand on This Radical Immigration Plan?
Politicians used to write bills pandering to American voters in election years. Now a bill in the House panders to deported criminals living in foreign countries. Chicago-area Rep. Jesús "Chuy" Garcia and 44 Democratic co-sponsors—including three other lawmakers from gang-ravaged Chicago—recently introduced a radical immigration bill called the New Way Forward Act that seeks, as per a press release from Mr. Garcia, to "disrupt the prison to deportation pipeline."
The bill would make it more difficult for U.S. authorities to deport illegal aliens who commit felonies. It would roll back the federal statute that requires local authorities to cooperate and communicate with Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, making sanctuary cities legal. Its provisions would also help return already deported felons to the U.S.
Not long ago such a proposal would have been dismissed as too radical in the faculty lounge at Berkeley; today it is fast approaching the mainstream in the increasingly woke Democratic Party. Consider the bill's key points:
• It would create a five-year statute of limitations for deportations and formally decriminalize illegal border crossings.
• It would raise the minimum prison sentence needed to require deportation from one year to five, paving the way for illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes such as armed robbery, sexual assault, child molestation and manslaughter to remain in America.


Lawmakers Push Revised Surveillance Law as Deadline Looms
WASHINGTON—House Democrats unveiled a revised version of legislation to renew domestic surveillance powers that are due to expire in five days, gambling that they could assemble a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats to pass legislation that has faced opposition from an emboldened civil-liberties bloc in Congress.
The measure, backed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and developed in tandem with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), was released late Tuesday and put on track for a House vote by the end of the week.
It isn't clear whether the White House would support the legislation, or if it would earn a vote in the Senate. President Trump told Republican lawmakers last week he wouldn't sign an extension of the expiring surveillance authorities without significant changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, according to people familiar with the matter. President Trump has pointed to a recent Justice Department watchdog report to claim FISA was improperly used against him to fuel the Russia investigation.
Some in the White House are preparing for the possibility that the provisions will expire on March 15, officials said, an occurrence that intelligence officials have warned could weaken national security. One White House official noted that Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), who has called for major changes to FISA, could block the measure in the Senate.
Mr. Paul called the bill "weak sauce," saying that Attorney General William Barr had a hand in weakening the measure. "None of the reforms prevent secret FISA court from abusing the rights of Americans," he said on Twitter, or "prevent a President of either party from a politically motivated investigation. Big Disappointment!"


The Virus and Leadership
When President Trump sees a political threat, his instinct is to deny, double down and hit back. That has often been politically effective, but in the case of the novel coronavirus it has undermined his ability to lead.
It's not accurate, as the press reported last week, that the President called the virus a "hoax." He said the criticisms of his Administration were a hoax. Yet his public remarks too often continue to give the impression that he views the virus more as another chance for political combat than as a serious public-health problem.
White House advisers last week said the virus is being "contained" despite contrary evidence. On Monday, after suggesting "fake news" was driving the stock-market rout, the President tweeted: "So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"
Like the common flu, except the death rate from the virus may be ten times higher. Like the common flu, except the U.S. population has no built-up immunity, so the virus left unchecked could infect a significantly higher share of the population at a faster rate, overwhelming the medical system.
We hope the dire coronavirus prognostications turn out not to pass, and no one knows how the coming months will play out. Yet with stock markets falling, schools canceling classes, companies emptying their offices, and nations locking down borders and some cities, Americans want steady leadership.


Despite Coronavirus, Some Religious Services Continue
DALLAS—County officials here have banned gatherings of more than 500 people and recommended gatherings of more than 250 be canceled to help halt the spread of the new coronavirus.
But on Sunday, crowds streamed into First Baptist Dallas, the downtown megachurch. Hundreds quickly filled the worship center, while more than 250 people went to an overflow room.
"A frightened world needs a fearless church," Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas, told his parishioners. "This is a time for First Baptist Dallas to be a fearless, courageous church."
He said he complied with the county order by not having more than 500 people in one room.


New York City Schools to Close Over Coronavirus
New York City's public school system—the largest in the country—and all other school districts in downstate New York will close to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Schools in the city will close Monday and stay shut until at least April 20, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference Sunday.
"We may actually have to go out for the whole school year, which is just extraordinarily painful," he said. Remote learning for the city schools system will begin March 23.
The decision to close the city's system—which serves more than 1 million children—came after mounting calls from parents, lawmakers and the city's teachers union. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said earlier Sunday that the union planned to file lawsuits Monday with the New York Supreme Court and the Labor Department if schools weren't closed.
Officials had debated for days. Gov. Andrew Cuomo settled the issue by announcing ahead of the mayor that all downstate schools would close.


Notable & Quotable: ISIS on the Coronavirus
Bridget Johnson reporting for Homeland Security Today, March 13:
ISIS included a full-page infographic on coronavirus prevention in the new issue of the terror group's official weekly al-Naba newsletter. . . .
ISIS highlights "the counsel to put trust in God and seek refuge in Him from illnesses" and "the obligation of taking up the causes of protection from illnesses and avoiding them." The terror group also added that "the healthy should not enter the land of the epidemic and the afflicted should not exit from it," though their claimed provinces and active cells aren't all operating in virus-free lands: While West and Central Africa remain mostly untouched, along with no reported cases in Syria or Yemen (where ongoing war would make gauging the extent of an outbreak difficult), cases have been reported in Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan, India, the Philippines and Indonesia.
ISIS also reminds followers to "cover the mouth when yawning and sneezing" and cites a hadith about germs and contamination: "Cover the vessels and tie up the waterskins, for there is one night in the year when pestilence descends, and it does not pass by any vessel that is not covered or any waterskin that is not tied up, but some of that pestilence descends into it."


U.S., World Leaders Step Up Efforts to Slow Spread of Coronavirus
The Trump administration urged Americans to avoid nonessential travel and large gatherings, significantly ramping up its recommendations aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus as leaders around the world moved to close borders and restrict movement.
As the center of the pandemic shifts to Europe and the U.S., the administration announced new guidelines encouraging the public to end discretionary travel and to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The guidelines—which officials said are recommendations, not requirements, and will last for the next 15 days—also encourage home schooling in addition to avoiding bars, restaurants and food courts.
"Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus," Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.
U.S. stock markets dropped sharply as fears continue that the measures won't be enough to ward off a recession caused by the pandemic. Economic data from China painted a bleak picture of the impact that government lockdowns have had, with business activity for the first two months of the year turning broadly negative for the first time on record.
Mr. Trump said he wasn't currently considering a nationwide lockdown or domestic travel restrictions. He said the outbreak could last until July or August.


Young Voters Outgrow Bernie Sanders
Democrats started down the road to socialism, then took an abrupt U-turn in South Carolina and have been speeding away ever since. One reason is that young voters haven't shown up for Bernie Sanders in the numbers he'd hoped.
True, Mr. Sanders won 74% of those under 30 in last week's Michigan primary, according to exit polls. But that was down from 81% in 2016. Their share of the electorate also declined, to 15% from 19%. Voters over 45 made up 63% of the Michigan electorate this year, compared with 55% in 2016. They overwhelmingly favored Joe Biden.
Other states show similar patterns. Under-30 voters still heavily favor Mr. Sanders, but his support in this age group fell by 36 percentage points in New Hampshire, 17 in Nevada, 14 points in Massachusetts and Virginia, and 15 in North Carolina. These states all voted before the field narrowed to Messrs. Sanders and Biden, but that wasn't enough for Mr. Sanders to carry Michigan, as he did in 2016.
Exit polls show voters under 30 made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate this year than in 2016 in New Hampshire (6 percentage points), South Carolina (4), Alabama (4) North Carolina (4), Tennessee (4), Texas (5), and Virginia (3). Voters over 65 increased their share by 8 points in New Hampshire, 10 in South Carolina, and 7 in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee.
Young Democrats also appear to be aging out of their enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders as they mature and start making money. Wages for young workers are rising faster than for any other age group, which may have diminished the salience of his populist economic message. Mr. Sanders's support this year among millennials in their 30s has been considerably lower than among those in their 20s. In Michigan, he won 53% of voters 30 to 39 compared with 74% of those under 30. In Iowa, 86% of voters under 25 in Iowa supported Mr. Sanders in 2016. This year only 55% of those 25 to 29 did.


Government Personnel Chief Resigns After Six Months
WASHINGTON—The director of the government Office of Personnel Management has resigned from the post after six months.
An OPM spokesperson said Tuesday that Dale Cabaniss had submitted her resignation from the office, which provides human resources and support to federal agencies, but didn't provide an explanation for why she is leaving.
Her exit was earlier reported in Politico.
The turnover comes as the Trump administration is responding to the coronavirus outbreak, which has shifted many federal workers to working from home.
Ms. Cabaniss was confirmed by the Senate for the role in September, after being nominated for the job by President Trump in March 2019. The agency said at the time that she had lengthy experience working with Congress and the executive branch and had served for more than 20 years as a senior staff member in the U.S. Senate.


Airline, Hotel Shares Plunge on Disappointing Rescue Plan
Airline shares fell sharply Wednesday after the Trump Administration proposed providing assistance to the struggling industry in loans, rather than the direct cash infusion companies had requested.
Shares of major hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Marriott International Inc. also tumbled, down 19% and 15%, respectively, Wednesday, as the administration offered a much smaller rescue plan than the companies had discussed with President Trump one day earlier.
The administration proposal includes $50 billion for a lending facility to support the airline industry, loans that would include requirements for specified continuation of service and limits on executive compensation until the loans are repaid.
Airlines this week had proposed a $50 billion assistance package but had asked for half of that to be paid in direct grants to provide the cash many carriers need right away.
"We cannot afford to wait long for assistance—governmental relief plus the signal it sends to the markets would be critical in getting several carriers through that near-term potential valley of death to make it to the end of the year," Airlines for America, a trade group, said Monday.


Washington, D.C., Closes Streets to Prevent Coronavirus Transmission
Washington, D.C., area officials urged the public Saturday to avoid the city's famous cherry blossoms and are taking the unusual step of closing down public streets to keep visitors away and prevent possible coronavirus spread.
Streets will be closed starting at 7 a.m. Sunday surrounding major Washington, D.C., tourist sites in an effort to limit crowds amid the coronavirus concerns, the Metropolitan Police Department said late Saturday.
There will be several closures along major city thoroughfares and parking restrictions around the National Mall and Tidal Basin on Sunday, the police said.
The action is being taken because officials have concluded necessary social distancing hasn't been possible due to crowds in those areas, according to a police statement.
"To help flatten the curve, we strongly discourage any Tidal Basin visits because social distancing has not been possible due to visitor volume," the statement said, referring to the goal of stopping the increase of coronavirus cases nationally.


Countries Roll Out Restrictions to Curb Coronavirus
A growing number of U.S. states urged residents to stay home Monday as cases of the novel coronavirus surged past 40,000 in the country and more governments around the world announced nationwide lockdowns.
The flurry of stay-at-home orders and advisories from states including Michigan, Massachusetts and Indiana come as the White House, under pressure to boost the economy, considers easing social-distancing guidelines as soon as next week, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Such a shift may not happen immediately after the 15-day period ends, an administration official said, adding that the White House is operating with a "high degree of caution."
President Trump said Monday evening at a White House briefing that his administration would make a decision on what he called the "opening of our country" once the 15-day period ends. He declined to be more specific, but said it would happen "a lot sooner than the three to four months that somebody was suggesting."
Also at Monday's press conference, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department would take action against those who hoarded protective equipment and other items to sell at high prices.
Meanwhile, governments in other parts of the world stepped up efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as cases surged past 367,000 Monday and the number of deaths surpassed 16,000. The United Kingdom and South Africa announced nationwide lockdowns Monday, only allowing residents to leave their homes under specific, essential circumstances.


An FDA Breakthrough on Treatment
The Food and Drug Administration on Sunday green-lighted two malaria medicines that have shown some promise treating the novel coronavirus, and the emergency approvals couldn't come soon enough. Expanding their use could bring quicker relief to patients and hospitals while allowing scientists to better assess their efficacy.
The malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine (HC) and chloroquine have been around for more than five decades, so their safety is well documented. New evidence suggests that they could also help fight the novel coronavirus, as op-eds by Dr. Jeff Colyer on these pages have reported. Both chloroquine and HC in vitro block the replication of RNA viruses like the novel coronavirus.
Hydroxychloroquine nowadays is often prescribed for the autoimmune conditions lupus and rheumatoid arthritis that result from the body's immune system attacking its own cells. Scientists have also documented an overreactive immune response in severely ill coronavirus patients.
Notably, a study in France of 80 coronavirus patients given HC and azithromycin, an antibiotic for upper respiratory infections, documented "a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care unit." Doctors have also reported anecdotal evidence of the malaria drugs' efficacy.
More study is needed, and a clinical trial of the two drugs involving 1,100 patients started last week in New York. But the FDA's emergency authorization will let more doctors prescribe the drug outside of clinical trials, and hospitals will be required to maintain data on drug dispensation and patient outcomes. This will allow a larger review than possible in a controlled clinical trial.


Americans Favor Aggressive Coronavirus Measures
WASHINGTON—A new survey finds widespread public support for aggressive measures like government cellphone tracking and mandatory health screenings in public places to curb the spread of coronavirus, which has infected more than 180,000 Americans.
The new results from Harris Poll show that support for such policies—even when they might affect privacy and civil liberties—crosses a spectrum of demographic and ideological lines, suggesting that policy makers have significant latitude from the public in crafting emergency responses to combat the virus.
The Harris survey, which was conducted online between March 28-30, reveals that 60% of adults back giving government officials access to anonymized cellphone location data to establish whether Americans are complying with social-distancing instructions.
The poll also finds that 71% of Americans would be willing to share their own mobile location data with authorities to receive alerts about their potential exposure to the virus—for example, if they were near a suspected or known coronavirus carrier.
In addition, 65% support a public registry that would show if their neighbors were diagnosed with the virus and 84% are in favor of mandatory health screenings to enter public places like beaches and airports. Another 77% back a mandate that businesses hosting events like concerts or conferences conduct health screenings.


Virus Grounds a U.S. Aircraft Carrier as Crew Quarantined in Guam
Most of the 5,000 crew members aboard a coronavirus-stricken American aircraft carrier will be allowed to disembark onto the U.S. island territory of Guam, where they will be quarantined in hotel rooms, government officials said Wednesday.
The USS Theodore Roosevelt, which has been docked at a Guam port since last week, has at least 93 sailors who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The ship's captain recently sent Navy leaders a memorandum asking for permission to quarantine the bulk of the crew off the ship, to prevent the contagious respiratory disease from infecting more sailors.
On Wednesday, Guam Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero said crew members who haven't tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus, known as Covid-19, will be housed in vacant hotels on the island and subject to a 14-day quarantine period. Military guards will be stationed on all floors and contact with civilians will be minimized, she said.
"The plan is to remove as many people off the Teddy Roosevelt as we can, understanding that we have to leave a certain amount of folks on board to do normal watchstanding duties, to keep the ship running," Rear Admiral John Menoni, Navy commander for the Marianas joint region, said at a joint press briefing with the governor.
The military is expected to start moving crew members off the ship in the coming days, he said, when arrangements have been made with specific hotels. He said about 40 marine medical professionals will arrive on the island in the next two days to provide assistance to hospitals.


New York Records Largest Single-Day Death Toll From Coronavirus
The pandemic's toll on the U.S. intensified, as New York reported its highest daily rise in deaths from the new coronavirus and an abysmal March jobs report pointed to a deeper labor-market collapse.
A continued surge in confirmed cases across America pushed the Trump administration to recommend Americans wear face masks when in public to reduce transmission.
U.S. stocks and government bond yields fell after new data showed employers shed 701,000 jobs last month, the start of a labor-market slowdown that could push the unemployment rate to new highs. A record 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.
Ten weeks after its first reported case of the new coronavirus, the U.S. is at the center of the global pandemic with more than 270,400 reported infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
On Thursday, the country accounted for the largest portion of the world's new cases, with nearly 30,100 new cases of the 80,600 total. And in a grim milestone, the official number of deaths rose by 1,169 in the 24 hours to Thursday evening—its highest daily toll.


Watchdog Says Trump Fired Him for Fulfilling Legal Obligations
WASHINGTON—The inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community, who played a pivotal role in allowing last year's Ukraine whistleblower complaint to be shared with Congress, said that President Trump fired him because of his commitment to being an independent watchdog.
"It is hard not to think that the president's loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial inspector general, and from my commitment to continue to do so," Michael Atkinson said in a two-page statement issued late Sunday.
Mr. Trump notified congressional intelligence committees late Friday that he intended to remove Mr. Atkinson from his post within 30 days, citing a loss of confidence but declining to elaborate.
The decision, which came as part of a broader White House move against intelligence leaders by the president, was widely criticized by Democrats and whistleblower advocates as retaliation for Mr. Atkinson's role in helping ensure the Ukraine whistleblower complaint was transmitted to Congress, as required by law.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Atkinson's statement, which was released to reporters.


Wisconsin Voters Go to Polls Despite Coronavirus
Voters headed to Wisconsin's polls Tuesday, many in masks and gloves, in an election that offered a window into the logistical and political challenges that could lie ahead for November's presidential balloting should the coronavirus pandemic linger until then.
Chaos surrounded the final days before the state's voters ventured out Tuesday to a significantly reduced number of polling places, following a partisan dispute between Republicans who wanted to hold the vote and Democrats who wanted to postpone the vote or extend absentee balloting.
Court challenges went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the Republican-led state Legislature. More than a dozen states have postponed or otherwise extended their contests because of the coronavirus crisis.
The voting wasn't likely to change the trajectory of either presidential primary—former Vice President Joe Biden had a comfortable lead in Democratic polls, while President Trump was expected to continue coasting to the Republican nomination—but local and state races were also on the ballot, including a closely watched state Supreme Court contest.
In Milwaukee, the state's largest city and home to the Democratic National Convention in August, the traditional 180 polling places were reduced to five.


Trump Eyes Tariffs as Tool to Tame Oil Glut
The Trump administration is turning toward the most well-worn pages of its global playbook—tariffs and threats—as it tries to stop an oil-price war from crippling dozens of U.S. companies.
In conversations with oil-company executives and lawmakers, President Trump has suggested tariffs on imported oil, possibly using the same trade law it used against China, according to people familiar with the matter. The tactic is aimed at leveraging U.S. power to get Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce a flood of crude swamping the market.
The Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied nations including Russia are set to hold a videoconference Thursday to negotiate an accord on production cuts.
The U.S. contends market forces will curb production. It is resisting pressure to mandate cuts for its oil producers, and isn't planning to have a representative participate, the people said.
"I would use tariffs, if I had to," Mr. Trump said at a White House briefing Sunday. "I don't think I'm going to have to."


New York Sees Another Day of Record Coronavirus Deaths
Restrictions meant to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus in New York are working, officials said Wednesday, even as the hard-hit state reported the largest daily death toll of the six-week outbreak.
For the fourth day in a row, more people died from the virus in New York than were admitted to hospitals for treatment. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 779 people died on Tuesday from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the pathogen. They include Richard Brodsky, a former state assemblyman from Westchester County.
Mr. Cuomo said the rate of new hospitalizations has continued to slow, and that 586 people were admitted to hospitals in the state on Tuesday. The total death toll rose to 6,268, and nearly 150,000 people had tested positive for the virus.
"We're flattening that curve, and if anything, we double-down now on our diligence," the Democratic governor said.
Mr. Cuomo also ordered flags lowered to half-mast in honor of the dead. He warned that the daily toll would remain at or possibly above the current figures for several days. The state remains the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., accounting for about a third of the cases in the country.


Trump Threatens to Deny Visas to Countries Refusing Deportees
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration threatened to withhold visas from several Central American countries if they refuse to accept their citizens deported from the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a White House memo and two people familiar with the matter.
The memo, issued by President Trump on Friday night, gives the administration authority to suspend visa access to any country that "denies or unreasonably delays" accepting citizens that the U.S. is seeking to deport, on grounds that the deported immigrants might be infected with the new coronavirus.
Under federal immigration law, the U.S. can withhold a broad array of visas from foreign nationals, or tailor visa sanctions that target certain classes of people, such as government officials in a particular country.
Though Mr. Trump directed his administration to take similar steps in an executive order issued within days of taking office in 2017, Friday's memo says the U.S. has the authority to take action "to respond to the ongoing pandemic."
The threat is aimed at several countries in Central America that have attempted to block deportation flights by sealing their borders and shutting down airports to commercial air travel, said two administration officials familiar with the matter.


Coronavirus May Stall Key Supreme Court Rulings
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court, often the last word on the most controversial issues confronting society, appeared headed for one of its most consequential terms in years only a month ago, but now it faces one of its lightest in recent memory.
As the presidential election looms, the justices are on the path of deciding fewer cases and deferring some heated and politically charged questions as the federal government's executive and legislative branches confront the coronavirus pandemic.
That is in contrast to the many state judiciaries and lower federal courts that have adapted to social-distancing rules by prioritizing certain categories of cases and shifting to new communications technologies. State supreme courts in California, Georgia and Texas are among those conducting oral arguments by video conference; according to the National Center for State Courts, 34 states, plus Washington, D.C., have required or urged their judges to adopt virtual hearings.
The U.S. Supreme Court, the only court specifically established by the Constitution, considers itself different in character from lower courts and holds unique responsibilities. It also is famously resistant to change.
With the court unable to hold its usual arguments, it has postponed two months of scheduled cases, leaving nearly a third of its docket in limbo, including a pair of major constitutional disputes about investigations of President Trump. The court so far hasn't come up with an alternative plan for getting those cases heard and decided, raising the possibility that some will be delayed until the public-health crisis subsides.


Supreme Court to Hold Oral Arguments by Teleconference
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court, breaking with longstanding tradition because of the coronavirus pandemic, said Monday it will hear oral arguments by teleconference in May, including in cases about the potential disclosure of President Trump's financial records.
"In keeping with public-health guidance in response to Covid-19, the Justices and counsel will all participate remotely," the court said in a written statement, adding that it will share more details "as they become available." The court for the first time will transmit a live audio feed of its sessions, allowing the public to hear the arguments as they unfold.
The move stops short of steps taken by many lower courts, including the state supreme courts of California, Kansas and Texas, to conduct arguments by publicly accessible videoconference.
Nonetheless, Monday's order is a sign of just how much the coronavirus has changed public life. The high court is famously resistant to change, and has summarily rejected requests from lawmakers, the news media and academics for live transmission of its arguments. Justices have said the prospect of cameras in the courtroom, or even streaming audio, could change a cherished and intimate dynamic between the bench and counsel.
The court's Monday announcement restored 10 cases to the court's argument calendar after the justices had previously postponed arguments for March and April because of the pandemic, representing nearly one-third of its docket.


Sanders Endorses Biden
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president in a bid to unify the competing factions of the Democratic Party.
Mr. Sanders joined his former opponent in the Democratic presidential race in a live stream event Monday, where he emphasized the need to defeat President Trump in November.
"Today I am asking all Americans. I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and I'm speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country," Mr. Sanders said.
Mr. Biden's next task is to unite the Democratic Party behind his candidacy. Mr. Sanders had attracted a passionate base of young, liberal supporters, many of whom believe Mr. Biden's pragmatic approach to governing doesn't go far enough.
Mr. Sanders suspended his campaign for president last week, making Mr. Biden the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Sanders didn't offer an endorsement at the time but said he would work with Mr. Biden to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.


Japan, China Vie to Supply Unproven Coronavirus Drug
TOKYO—A drug called favipiravir has set off a diplomatic tug of war between geopolitical rivals Japan and China, both of which are offering it to other nations as a gesture to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
What makes the rival diplomacy unusual is the lack of solid evidence that either country's pills can help virus victims. Only one peer-reviewed article suggests the drug's efficacy in fighting Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and previous studies show favipiravir could cause birth defects if taken by pregnant women. That article, reporting on a small study in China, was republished Thursday U.S. time, two weeks after it was pulled from the internet without explanation.
Favipiravir is one example of how coronavirus treatments have become a political as well as a medical issue. President Trump, trying to rally the country with reasons for optimism, has advocated the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for Covid-19, overriding the caution of medical advisers who say there is no clear evidence yet that it works.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese officials, heartened by mostly anecdotal reports of success in treating Covid-19, are championing the drug, which a Japanese company initially developed under the brand name Avigan.
"My plan is to expand use as much as possible for every patient who wants it," said Mr. Abe at a news conference on April 7. "We've actually received requests from more than 30 countries on Avigan: 'Please send it from Japan, please supply it.' " The same night, he went on public broadcaster NHK and called the drug a "silver bullet."


America Won't Have a Grand Reopening
Can we please stop talking about "reopening" the U.S. economy? Probably not, because President Trump owns the national megaphone and won't relinquish it, and the media have latched on to the term. But it is a lousy metaphor.
For one thing, there is no on-off switch. Swaths of the economy—restaurants, travel, retail shops—were already shrinking before governments ordered them shut, because people were afraid to dine, travel or shop. These fears will abate gradually, with the pace dictated by the course of the virus, not by anybody's decree.
For another, only some parts of the economy are closed. The Journal is in business. So is your local supermarket. Many economists estimate that the 2020 recession will drive down the level of U.S. economic output by somewhere around 10%. That would be disastrous; it fell only about 4% in the "Great Recession" of 2007-09. But a 10% decline still leaves 90% standing. The U.S. economy is large and diverse. Some places and industries will get back to business faster than others. That, too, will depend on the course of the disease.
Finally, the "call" isn't up to Mr. Trump. Governors and mayors will decide based on local conditions. A one-size-fits-all recovery plan makes no sense for this vast country, anyway. The worst thing that could happen to the economy is for the nation to suffer second and third waves of infection because economic decisions get disconnected from public-health conditions. That would destroy any chance of a V-shaped recession and recovery.
Americans have lived through recessions before, but this one is different. It came suddenly, without warning. It wasn't caused by any of the usual suspects, such as tight money or oil shocks. And it calls for a recession-fighting tool kit that is starkly different from past models. Standard antirecession measures such as tax cuts and low interest rates will have weak effects when people are afraid to shop. We must think outside the box.


New Jersey Nursing Home Under Investigation After Coronavirus Deaths
Authorities in New Jersey are investigating the state's largest nursing home site after dozens of residents died, many from the coronavirus.
More than a dozen of the deceased residents were being kept in a small holding room in the facility before they were removed with the assistance of law-enforcement officials Monday, said Chaim Scheinbaum, chief executive at Alliance Healthcare, which owns the facility.
Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday he was "outraged the bodies of the dead were allowed to pile up in a makeshift morgue at the facility."
The governor asked Attorney General Gurbir Grewal to investigate what happened at the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II in Andover, N.J., while also looking more broadly at long-term care facilities where a disproportionate number of people have died from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat whose congressional district includes Andover, said the administrator of the Andover Subacute facility contacted him over the weekend asking for personal protective equipment and body bags.


Appeals Court Revives Literacy Suit Against Detroit Schools
A federal appeals court on Thursday revived a case brought by a group of Detroit students alleging that the city's worst-performing public schools had deprived them of a minimum education, violating their constitutional right to literacy.
The suit, filed in 2016 against the state of Michigan, alleges that students were subject to inadequate teaching and unsafe buildings with infestations of mice and cockroaches. The suit was filed as a class action on behalf of all students in those schools.
In the ruling Thursday the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that a review of Supreme Court education cases "demonstrates that we should recognize a basic minimum education to be a fundamental right."
The ruling overturned a 2018 decision by a U.S. district judge dismissing the lawsuit and rejecting the students' claim that access to a minimum level of education to attain literacy is a fundamental right.
The lawsuit will now head back to the district court.


Connecticut's Plans to Relocate Patients Recovering From Coronavirus Stir Backlash
The rural town of Sharon, Conn., is the state's first test of a plan to relocate older nursing-home residents recovering from the new coronavirus.
More than 50 patients recovering from the virus who were discharged from hospitals in cities such as Hartford and Danbury moved into Sharon Health Care Center, the town's 88-bed nursing home, this past week. To make room, the center moved out all of its regular residents, except for eight who tested positive for Covid-19.
Connecticut has some of the highest Covid-19 case rates in the U.S., with 647 cases per 100,000 residents compared with 262 cases per 100,000 residents nationally. Most of Connecticut's cases are concentrated in the counties of Fairfield, adjacent to New York state, New Haven and Hartford.
Sharon, population 2,700, sits among rolling hills and farmland on the border with New York state. Many New York City residents also own weekend homes in the town. In Litchfield County, which includes Sharon, there have been 751 cases as of Thursday. Sharon has had 11 cases.
Its top official, First Selectman Brent Colley, and other residents disagree with the state's plan to put the recovery unit in their community, which they say has minimal health-care infrastructure. In addition to the nursing home, there is a 78-bed hospital. Volunteers run the fire department and ambulance squad.


Trump Questions Whether to Aid States in Next Stimulus Legislation
WASHINGTON—President Trump said he is skeptical of providing funding for states in the next round of coronavirus relief legislation, throwing into doubt the administration's support for hundreds of billions of dollars sought by Democratic leaders and state governors of both parties.
"Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states aren't looking for bailout help?" Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. "I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?"
In the run-up to the passage of the most recent stimulus bill last week, Mr. Trump said he supported more state and local funding in the next round, and Democrats and the Trump administration said it would be a priority in the talks. But since then, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has termed the potential aid a "blue state bailout" for the troubled pension funds of large Democratic-controlled states.
"We do want to help [states] with expenses that are directly related to the coronavirus outbreak," said Mr. McConnell in a Fox News Radio interview on Monday. "But we're not interested in helping them fix age-old problems that they haven't had the courage to fix in the past."
Mr. McConnell also said health-care providers and businesses need protection from potential lawsuits related to the crisis, calling it his "red line for the next negotiation."


Justin Amash Explores Libertarian Presidential Bid
Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a Republican-turned-independent who is an outspoken critic of President Trump, said Tuesday evening that he has formed a presidential exploratory committee to run for the Libertarian Party's nomination.
"Today, I launched an exploratory committee to seek the @LPNational's nomination for president of the United States," he wrote on Twitter. "Americans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people."
Mr. Amash, a fifth-term congressman, would need considerable help to still get on the ballot in many states.
"We're ready for a presidency that will restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together," he wrote. "I'm excited and honored to be taking these first steps toward serving Americans of every background as president."
Mr. Amash's district includes Grand Rapids and other parts of western Michigan.


Government's Ambulance Chasers
One of the most essential responses to a pandemic is ensuring medical providers can adapt quickly to meet new demands. Yet recently an all-female EMT brigade in New York, a family-run ambulance business in Ohio and a fifth-generation ambulance company in Florida were all stopped from providing vital medical transportation. Why? Because they couldn't prove to the government's satisfaction that their services were "needed."
In 36 states, health-care providers must obtain a "certificate of need" before building a facility or purchasing new equipment. This is a long, tedious process that is separate from satisfying health and safety regulations. In five states, ambulance businesses must get a certificate of need before opening or expanding.
Take Ezras Nashim, which means "Helping Women" in Hebrew. This volunteer group of female EMTs would like to operate an ambulance to serve Hasidic women in Brooklyn, N.Y. Given the community's strong practice of modesty, many Hasidic women prefer to receive medical care from other women.
Ezras Nashim last year applied to New York City's Regional Emergency Medical Services Council for a certificate. But competing ambulance companies testified at the group's hearing that another provider wasn't needed. Despite pleas from women in the community, the council denied Ezras Nashim's application.
This is standard for these processes: Those who hold a certificate are invited to show up at the hearing and testify about whether they think new competition is desirable. Not surprisingly, applications are often protested, and protested applications are usually denied.


U.S. Charges Honduran President's Police Ally in Drug Ring
Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged the former chief of the Honduran National Police in a cocaine-trafficking conspiracy case, part of a sweeping investigation into drug-world corruption in Honduras that also implicates the country's president.
In a complaint unsealed Thursday in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares used his position as a high-ranking law-enforcement official to protect a group of politically connected drug traffickers. Prosecutors said Mr. Bonilla facilitated the trafficking of multiton shipments of cocaine through Central America to the U.S. on behalf of Honduras's current president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who authorities identified as an uncharged co-conspirator in the complaint.
In 2011, witnesses told authorities, Mr. Bonilla—nicknamed "El Tigre"—took part in the slaying of a rival drug trafficker, prosecutors said. He then claimed to investigate the killing, calling it a well-planned, efficient surprise attack, according to the complaint.
Mr. Bonilla, 60 years old, remains at large, officials said. He was charged with three counts, including weapons charges and conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S., in a scheme that prosecutors said extended from 2003 to 2018. He isn't charged in the 2011 killing.
Mr. Bonilla didn't immediately return a call and a message requesting comment. In an interview with a Honduran television station, he denied the charges and said he was ready to go wherever the U.S. embassy and the State Department requested him to go in order to clear his name.


Testing Isn't Everything
Many states are starting to lift their shutdown orders, but some governors are still insisting they need more testing to do so. The Trump Administration on Monday responded by laying out all of the country's testing capacity. But no amount of testing by itself will stop the virus from spreading. States will need a cocktail of strategies to limit the spread of infections.
***
Testing problems did hamper the initial U.S. response and allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected for weeks in Seattle and New York City. Testing was at first limited to people who had knowingly come into contact with infected individuals, and then it took days to get results. President Trump too often overpromised what the feds couldn't deliver.
But testing has dramatically ramped up, and the Food and Drug Administration has now approved 70 coronavirus tests—about four times more than it approved for the H1N1 flu virus in 2009. More tests per capita have been performed in New York City than in Singapore, South Korea and Australia.
Hospitals and labs have performed about 1.6 million tests in the past week, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The White House coronavirus task force presentation shows that most states with the biggest risks have the capacity to test 60% to 80% of their population each month. Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week said tests would be available at some 5,000 pharmacies across New York.
Credit private innovation. Abbott Labs says it had shipped one million tests for its 18,000 portable machines in the field that can return results in five minutes and is manufacturing 50,000 kits a day. U.S. hospitals have more than 5,000 Cepheid fast-testing machines, which require no special training. Some 93% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a test site.


War Rages On in Ruined Mogadishu
Mogadishu, Somalia
First, the blue of the ocean. Then the bright white of the fishermen's houses. Looking through the plane window, you get a sense of Italian languor. Fittingly, since Somalis tell me Mogadishu means "a tea garden for travelers."
The scenery changes on landing. The airport is a fortress, surrounded by Hesco barriers and tangled metal, into which the jihadists of al-Shabaab lobbed mortar fire a day earlier. Mistrustful customs officers ask not about coronavirus but whether you're armed. The city is nearly destroyed, its collapsed buildings denuded of all but their concrete pillars and steel beams.
On the top level of the old Xooga Hospital, to which we are immediately led, we encounter a government sharpshooter on the lookout for a rebel sniper. But hasn't al-Shabaab pulled out of the city? I whisper the question to the sergeant standing a few feet away. Stifling a laugh, he answers: "That's news to me. Mogadishu is a sieve." He gestures as if shaking a dish rack: "The terrorists come and go as they please. Even down there, in the hospital cemetery, they're waiting for the burial to begin."
Below, a group of women wearing colorful abayas mill about under a pine tree. At the entrance to what looks like a vacant lot, a convoy of 4x4s signify the eminence of the deceased. The sergeant herds us brusquely into the only part of the stairway still protected by a bit of roof. The government rifleman fires. A pickup behind the cemetery wall takes off in a cloud of red dust. When we descend and leave the hospital, the women under the tree haven't budged.


Israel's High Court Clears Way for Netanyahu to Form Next Government
TEL AVIV—Israel's top court ruled that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can form a government while under indictment, removing a final hurdle in the incumbent's bid to remain in power as he goes on trial later this month on corruption charges.
The High Court this week reviewed eight separate petitions challenging a deal between Mr. Netanyahu and rival Benny Gantz to form a unity government after three inconclusive elections in a year. The two politicians said the coronavirus pandemic necessitated an end to continued political uncertainty.
But their deal was challenged by nongovernmental organizations, other political parties and advocacy groups who argued Mr. Netanyahu shouldn't be leading a government while he faces bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges.
Late on Wednesday, the panel of 11 High Court judges decided not to intervene. "The legal decision we've reached is not meant to detract from the seriousness of the pending charges against MP Benjamin Netanyahu..nor from the difficulty of the tenure of a prime minister charged with criminal acts," the justices wrote in their decision. "It is the result..of having the presumption of innocence."
Mr. Netanyahu, the first sitting premier to be indicted, will go on trial on May 24. He denies wrongdoing.


Caesar, God and the Lockdowns
As governors consider how to ease their lockdowns, they might take a moment to read a pair of unanimous opinions this month from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. They rebuke the idea of giving office parks greater pandemic leeway than churches.
A March order by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear barred "mass gatherings," including religious ones. Offices and factories were exempt if they followed "appropriate social distancing." Other orders said that only "life sustaining" enterprises could stay open. That included law firms, laundromats and liquor stores, but not churches.
When Maryville Baptist Church in Louisville held an Easter service, some worshipers went inside. But a loudspeaker in the parking lot allowed sequestered faithful to stay in their cars. State police placed notices on vehicles, including occupied ones, explaining that congregants were breaking the law. The police took down license-plate numbers. The church sued.
"It's not always easy to decide what is Caesar's and what is God's—and that's assuredly true in the context of a pandemic," a Sixth Circuit panel wrote on May 2. That said: "The Governor has offered no good reason so far for refusing to trust the congregants who promise to use care in worship in just the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and laundromat workers to do the same. Are they not often the same people, going to work on one day and attending worship on another?"
Or this comparison: "Why is it safe to wait in a car for a liquor store to open but dangerous to wait in a car to hear morning prayers?" The question "is more difficult," the court concluded, for gatherings inside a sanctuary. But it temporarily blocked Kentucky from prohibiting the drive-in service. The Governor, in a subsequent court filing, pointed to news reports of 50 to 100 people inside the church.


Judge Appoints Lawyer to Argue Against Dismissal of Charges in Flynn Case
WASHINGTON—The judge overseeing the government's case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn appointed a retired judge to argue against the government's motion to dismiss the case, and opened the door to holding Mr. Flynn in contempt of court for pleading guilty under oath twice only to later change his mind.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday appointed John Gleeson, telling him in an order to also address whether the court should consider holding Mr. Flynn in criminal contempt for perjury.
The order raises the possibility that Mr. Flynn could be held in additional legal jeopardy for the two separate guilty pleas he entered before the court.
Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty in two separate proceedings in federal court in Washington to a single count of lying to the FBI and was awaiting sentencing. After a long delay in his sentencing, he fired his longtime legal team at the firm Covington & Burling LLP and retained a new lawyer, Sidney Powell, who in January sought to withdraw his plea and dismiss his case entirely.
The Justice Department sided with Mr. Flynn's lawyer last week, moving to dismiss the charges on the grounds that it no longer believed it could prove its case against Mr. Flynn.


House Narrowly Passes $3 Trillion Aid Package
WASHINGTON--The House narrowly passed a sprawling, $3 trillion coronavirus-relief package Friday night, capping a weeklong effort by Democratic leaders to quash rebellions from various wings of their party.
The proposal, which passed 208 to 199, marks the Democrats' starting point for talks with Republicans and the White House on the next round of stimulus, and sets the stage for dueling political messages in an election year. Fourteen House Democrats, many of whom were elected in 2018 from swing districts, voted against it. One Republican, Rep. Peter King of New York, voted in favor of the bill.
The House bill includes about $1 trillion in direct aid to states and localities, including grants and education assistance, to deal with the effects of the pandemic. It would put a new round of one-time cash payments into Americans' bank accounts, extend the duration of enhanced jobless benefits, help cover some rents and mortgages, forgive some student-loan debt and send premium pay to essential workers in fields such as health care.
"The plan that we are voting on today will make a tremendous difference not only in the budgets in the states, but in the lives of the American people," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said on the House floor Friday. "We think this is a major investment in the lives of the American people and in the budgets of our states and localities."
The bill overcame a key hurdle Friday night when Democratic leaders were able to beat back a Republican effort to strip out a contentious provision enabling undocumented immigrants who have tax identification numbers to receive direct stimulus payments. Key blocs of liberal and Hispanic lawmakers had threatened to oppose the overall bill if that measure were removed, but voting to preserve it was a political challenge for more centrist Democrats, particularly those in districts won by President Trump.


Trump Administration Extends Order Blocking Migrants at Border
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration extended a public-health order allowing it to reject migrants crossing U.S. borders without giving them access to the asylum system until the government determines the new coronavirus no longer poses a danger to the public.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the indefinite extension on Tuesday. The order was introduced in March for a duration of 30 days and extended in April for another 30 days.
The public-health order allows the government to turn back any migrants it encounters crossing the border—including unaccompanied children and anyone asking for humanitarian protection—without taking them into custody or allowing them to file asylum claims. It is distinct from restrictions on nonessential travel across the Mexican and Canadian borders, which were introduced at the same time but which the government extended for only an additional 30 days on Tuesday.
"This order has been one of the most critical tools the department has used to prevent the further spread of the virus and to protect the American people," acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a written statement.
President Trump said in March he would use an emergency public-health law to temporarily block migrants' access to the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying migrants crossing the border illegally posed a public-health risk to border agents and local hospitals—and could spark an outbreak if kept in border detention.


The Arbitrary Lockdowns Violate the Constitution
Regarding your editorial "Caesar, God and the Lockdowns" (May 12): The First Amendment to the Constitution protects the right to exercise one's religion and the right of the people to peaceably assemble without interference from the government. The U.S. Supreme Court in its Smith (1990) decision held that enforcement of neutral laws of general applicability do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The question here is, are these gubernatorial edicts both neutral and generally applicable? When governors prohibit groups of, say, 10 or more from congregating in a church or, for that matter, on a street corner, but allow hundreds to line up in a Costco, are they really applying the law generally?
Is choosing one business or group over another based on "essentiality," whatever that means, truly neutral? Are these decisions supported by scientific facts? Are 50 parishioners wearing masks and gloves, sitting 10 feet apart in a church that holds 500 really more dangerous to the general health and welfare of the public than 10 people lined up in a small gas-station store? Food procurement has been defined as essential. It's time to nourish our souls with spiritual food, and that means safely reopening God's house.

Islamic Terrorists Win a Convert
Rome
When Italian aid worker Silvia Romano returned home this month, the government hoped for a bright moment amid the devastation of Covid-19. Ms. Romano, 25, had been held captive in East Africa for 18 months by a gang affiliated with the Islamist terrorist group al-Shabaab. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte personally welcomed her back, but her liberation wasn't an unblemished political victory. In fact, it infuriated many Italians.
Ms. Romano appeared in a chador, a modest garment common in many Islamic countries. During an interrogation, she reportedly told officials that she had converted to Islam freely and now went by Aisha. The former hostage denied rumors that she had been forced to marry one of her abductors. She said they treated her well.
The West has waged war against Islamist extremists for decades. Raising arms against such evil to ensure security and stability for innocents at home and abroad is justifiable and laudable. But there are other reasons for the fight, and Ms. Romano's story suggests that many Westerners have forgotten them.
The former hostage is innocent of wrongdoing, the victim of a tragedy that cost her dearly. No one yet knows, and it's possible no one will ever know, whether genuine belief or incessant brainwashing motivated her conversion. Yet I can relate to Ms. Romano. I too come from Milan, an industrial city with a proud history of hardworking people now suffering from spiritual decay. As a freelance journalist in North Africa, I also spent significant time living among Muslims.


Hong Kong Protesters Fear End of the Road
HONG KONG—Beijing's plan to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong with a new security law sent a chill through opposition groups, dealing a blow to a protest movement that nearly a year ago rallied a million people to the streets to halt China's growing influence over the former British colony.
Leading pro-democracy figures said a national security law to be imposed on the city, outlined Thursday by a spokesman for China's legislature, undermined Hong Kong's autonomy and broke the promise China made to preserve the financial center's way of life after its handover from the U.K. in 1997.
"I know that everyone is scared and worried tonight," Joshua Wong, one of the city's best-known activists, wrote in a Facebook post. "After this law is passed: What will happen to Hong Kong? How many people will be prosecuted? How many organizations will be banned?"
For more than two decades since China reclaimed sovereignty from the U.K. over Hong Kong, citizens have regularly taken to the streets to exercise their free speech and freedom of assembly—rights enshrined in the handover agreement. But monthslong protests last year—some large and peaceful, others violent—represented the biggest challenge in decades to the authority of China's ruling Communist Party.
While Hong Kong's government eventually scrapped an extradition bill that had sparked the demonstrations, the protest movement morphed into opposition against the local government and Beijing's rule. In recent months, Chinese officials have increasingly blasted opposition voices, labeled some violent protesters as terrorists and hit out at nations, including the U.S., that it blames for fomenting the unrest.


China Moves on Hong Kong
China's forceful takeover of Hong Kong appears to have begun, and threats against Taiwan are rising. That's the message this week as the National People's Congress in Beijing moved to pass an onerous new security law for Hong Kong and the Chinese navy plans to practice an amphibious assault on an island controlled by Taiwan.
Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, China promised Hong Kong legal autonomy and the preservation of basic liberties, including freedom of speech, press and assembly. Yet Beijing is now seeking to bypass the Hong Kong Legislative Council and impose the national-security law unilaterally. This rule-by-diktat means the end of the "one country, two systems" arrangement that Beijing promised for 50 years after 1997.
Enforcement of the national-security legislation would erase the legal lines between Hong Kong and the mainland. By our deadline China's Communist Party legislature hadn't released a draft bill, but rest assured the purpose is to silence and punish dissent to prevent a repeat of last year's mass protests in Hong Kong. For months Beijing has falsely accused protesters of seeking independence from the mainland and acting on behalf of a foreign "black hand."
On Monday pro-Beijing lawmakers used a legally questionable procedure to seize control of a powerful Legislative Council committee that vets bills and schedules final votes. China's Hong Kong surrogates can now move forward with legislation making disrespect of China's national anthem a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. When pro-democracy lawmakers protested, security guards dragged some from the room. Legislator Ted Hui had to go to the hospital after he was kicked in the chest so hard he struggled to breathe, the South China Morning Post reported.
At a hearing Monday Hong Kong prosecutors signaled they may seek yearslong sentences for 15 pro-democracy activists arrested for their role in last year's protests. They include Martin Lee, the father of the Hong Kong democracy movement, media tycoon Jimmy Lai, and other prominent advocates of peaceful protest. The cases will now be heard in district court, which has the authority to impose sentences of up to five years for those found guilty of participating or organizing unauthorized protests.


Planned Parenthood Chapters Draw Scrutiny Over Paycheck Protection Loans
Planned Parenthood Federation of America is facing scrutiny from the Trump administration after local chapters received more than $80 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, the latest flashpoint in the fight over what kinds of entities should be eligible for the small-business funds.
The Small Business Administration, which oversees the PPP, sent letters to about three dozen chapters of Planned Parenthood this week, saying that it has made a preliminary finding that the chapters are ineligible to get money from the program, and directing that the money be returned. The SBA letters said that because it found the chapters to be centrally controlled by the broader Planned Parenthood Federation of America, they count as one entity, which is too large to qualify for the aid.
Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations and public policy for Planned Parenthood, said the group's chapters received PPP money to continue operating amid coronavirus-related shutdowns. She defended the loans as proper and said the SBA's investigation was a politically motivated attack on the organization.
"Just like other nonprofits and health-care providers, this pandemic has had a significant impact on Planned Parenthood health centers' ability to provide care. Paycheck Protection Program loans have ensured health centers can retain staff and continue to provide patients with essential, time-sensitive sexual and reproductive health care during this crisis," Ms. Ayers said in a statement.
Many companies and other organizations have drawn criticism for taking loans from the PPP, a $660 billion pot intended to help small businesses and nonprofits with 500 or fewer employees. Some have returned the money after public pressure, with critics saying they weren't the intended recipients of the loans, which are designed to be forgiven if spent mostly on employee wages. Shake Shack Inc., a national burger chain, returned $10 million, and the Los Angeles Lakers gave back a $4.6 million loan.


States Sue Trump Administration Over Easing of Auto Standards
A coalition of 23 states filed suit Wednesday against the Trump administration's March easing of tailpipe-emissions standards, arguing that it violated the law and was based on faulty analyses.
The Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in March significantly cut back on clean air rules for cars, including increased mileage standards, that were put in place by the Obama administration in 2012 with the aim of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and improving fuel efficiency.
The Trump administration argued that its new rule would boost car sales and save consumers money by cutting the sale price of new cars by about $1,000. The move was criticized at the time by environmentalists.
The White House and the Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit. Most of the states backing it are led by Democratic governors, including California, Michigan, New York and Colorado. The suit was also backed by the District of Columbia, the cities of New York, Los Angeles, Denver and San Francisco, and the counties of Denver and San Francisco.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the rule a "job-killer and public health hazard."


Notable & Quotable: The Draft
From "Drastic Coronavirus Lockdowns Are The Most Regressive Policies Since The Draft" by J.T. Young at the Federalist, May 28:
Those people working in lower-earning occupations are most victimized by lockdowns, as they more likely lack work-at-home options. The same regressive dynamic applies to business-owners. Those with limited capital and limited opportunities to borrow suffer most. And it applies to those forced back onto their savings: The smaller, the more vulnerable.
The same regressive effects reverberate throughout different aspects of the lockdowns. In transportation, those with lower incomes face the risks of public transit, or its absence. For those whose children are trapped in inferior public school, their kids lack the same remote learning opportunities of better public and private schools. In child care, outside day care is lost, or its risk increased. Inevitably, bankruptcies will come, and these too will be concentrated here. Full recoveries may take years, if they ever occur.
Despite these increasing regressive effects, the lockdowns spawning them are in the most self-styled "progressive" states. . . . The draft's inequities were clear, and efforts to address them failed because the policy was inherently regressive. So too are lockdowns. Understandably, rushing to wage war on the little-understood coronavirus, overly aggressive responses occurred.


U.S. Seeks to Sell More Arms to Saudi Arabia
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is planning to sell nearly $500 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, drawing renewed objections from senior Democratic lawmakers who question the timing and justification for the deal.
Preliminary notification of the latest sale was sent to senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee in mid-January, congressional aides said. A more formal notice is expected soon.
The proposal stands to reignite tensions over arms sales to Washington's Gulf allies, and comes roughly a year after the White House and lawmakers clashed over $8.1 billion in arms sales to the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates.
In May 2019, the Trump administration declared an emergency, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said was linked to escalating threats from Iran. That enabled the administration to bypass standard congressional notification procedures regarding arms sales and triggered protests from Democrats and some Republicans who tried, but failed, to block the weapons transfers.
If the newest sale is carried out, Saudi Arabia would buy 7,500 Paveway IV precision-guided munitions, manufactured by Raytheon Technologies Corp. , said a congressional aide familiar with the details. That is in addition to 60,000 precision-guided munitions that Riyadh bought under the 2019 deal.


Senate Approves Bill Extending Paycheck Protection Program
WASHINGTON—The Senate approved a bipartisan bill to loosen requirements on hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable small-business loans, though some business leaders say the help is too late to save struggling businesses.
The legislation passed Wednesday with unanimous consent in the Senate, and passed the House last week 417-1, showing the bipartisan support to improve the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created by Congress in March to help employers struggling to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic.
The legislation extends the duration of PPP loans to 24 weeks from eight weeks, giving small businesses more time to use the money and still have the loans forgiven while helping them better navigate the uncertainties around reopening. It also extends the deadline to rehire workers to Dec. 31 to qualify for loan forgiveness.
Moreover, many businesses that sought loans were constricted by Small Business Administration regulations mandating that 75% of the expenses go to payroll. The bill reduces the level of Paycheck Protection Program funds that must be used for payroll to 60% from 75%.
The bill now heads to President Trump for a signature. The White House declined to comment on the legislation. A spokesman for the Small Business Administration, which manages the program, didn't respond to a request for comment.


U.S. Nursing Home Population Shrank 10% This Year
The coronavirus pandemic dealt a crushing blow to nursing homes across the U.S., driving down their occupancy by nearly 100,000 residents between the end of 2019 and late May, according to new federal data.
The data gives the public its first broad look into individual nursing homes and sheds new light on the scale of the pandemic's impact on the industry and those it serves. Nursing homes reported nearly 32,000 resident deaths linked to the coronavirus, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Thursday.
The sharp decline in nursing home occupancy—about 10% of the nursing home population as of Dec. 31—reflects many factors including virus-related deaths, deaths from other causes and a steep drop in new admissions.
To measure the impact of the virus, The Wall Street Journal compared resident data released by the CMS for each facility to a separate data set the government gathered in December.
The new CMS data has many limitations. Only about 12,000 nursing homes submitted data that passed the Medicare agency's data-quality checks for the most recent period surveyed, out of around 15,000 in the country. Even then, Journal identified other likely errors—such as a New Jersey nursing home that reported nearly eight times more coronavirus-related deaths than it has beds.


Ahmaud Arbery Case: Judge Gives Green Light to Try Three White Men
A judge ruled Thursday that there was probable cause to try three white men on murder charges in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was fatally shot while out running in southeast coastal Georgia.
The decision concluded a day of testimony at a preliminary hearing in which state prosecutors asserted that Mr. Arbery was "chased, hunted down and ultimately executed," and that the white man who shot him was heard saying racial slurs over his body.
The prosecution laid out its case against Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, and William Bryan Jr., 50, at the Glynn County courthouse, detailing how the three men pursued Mr. Arbery in February.
From the witness stand, Richard Dial, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's special agent in charge, recounted how Travis McMichael used a racial slur after he fatally shot Mr. Arbery and before police arrived at the scene. According to Mr. Dial's testimony, Mr. Bryan told investigators he heard Travis McMichael call Mr. Arbery a "f—ing n—."
Attorneys for Travis McMichael denied he had used a racial slur and suggested Mr. Bryan was lying to investigators in a bid for leniency. It is a crime to make false statements to investigators. Attorneys for Gregory McMichael argued that his actions didn't constitute aiding a murder. And an attorney for Mr. Bryan said his client, who videotaped the shooting, didn't commit any crime by joining the pursuit of Mr. Arbery.


Federal Agents Lacking Insignia Raise Accountability Concerns
The Trump administration's deployment of hundreds of officers in military-style riot gear, sometimes without identifying insignia, has stirred tensions with demonstrators and concerns among watchdog groups and lawmakers about accountability.
Attorney General William Barr has sent hundreds of agents from the Justice Department's law-enforcement units—the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the federal Bureau of Prisons, in particular—to conduct crowd control and investigate crimes. Adding in thousands of National Guard troops from 10 states, plus local police, makes for a confusing combination.
Who are the unidentified officers?
Many of the officers whose agencies aren't identifiable by markings on their uniforms are from federal Bureau of Prisons tactical teams. They normally respond to riots behind bars, where, officials said, the agency they work for is understood and such markings are generally unnecessary. As the violence escalated, Mr. Barr temporarily empowered the bureau to make arrests in the continuing protests, according to a law-enforcement official. The bureau said in a statement that its officers are highly trained and capable in such scenarios.
"I probably should have done a better job of marking them nationally as the agency," Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal said Thursday. "But I assure you no one was specifically told, to my knowledge, not to identify themselves."
What are the rules on whether uniforms of law-enforcement agents must bear identification showing their agencies and often their names?
Many local police departments require officers to have some sort of identification, including their names, on their uniforms. The Justice Department under the Obama administration criticized the Ferguson, Mo., police force after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown for allowing its officers to work without nameplates, calling them "a near-universal requirement of sound policing practices."


George Floyd's Killing Sparks Protests in Europe, Soul-Searching in France
PARIS—The killing of George Floyd has sparked marches and sporadic vandalism in Europe. In France, it has rekindled controversies over institutional racism and police violence in a society divided after the monthslong yellow-vest protests.
Thousands gathered in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in Frankfurt and Berlin. Hamburg police said more than 1,000 people had gathered Friday afternoon outside the U.S. consulate, far more than the 250 participants police had permitted to maintain enough distance between people.
In London, thousands turned out in protest on Wednesday and last weekend, marching on government offices and to the U.S. Embassy, resulting in arrests and some violence and vandalism. Marches are planned in London and other British cities for this weekend.
Mr. Floyd, a black man, was killed in police custody, sparking protests across the U.S. over police brutality. A white Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest. The officer has been charged in the killing.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets this week in France, defying pandemic-inspired bans on large public gatherings, to express outrage over Mr. Floyd's fate and that of a Frenchman of African descent who died in police custody four years ago.


New York City Mulls Police Cuts Amid Protesters' Calls for Change
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday he is committed to cutting funding to the New York Police Department as part of a wave of reform for the agency, but said the amount would be determined over the next three weeks during budget talks.
Mr. de Blasio declined to say how much money would be shifted away from the NYPD, but said it would be less than $1 billion, a figure that some elected officials see as a goal. The department has an annual budget of $5.6 billion.
"Something substantial? Yes," Mr. de Blasio said of the cuts at a press conference. "And that will be subject to negotiation. And the first thing I want to see it go to is youth programs."
The Democratic mayor on Sunday announced his plans to shift money out of the NYPD's budget. The decision came after more than a week of mostly peaceful protests in the city over the killing of George Floyd and police brutality. Mr. Floyd, a black man, was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis. Demonstrations have taken place around the country, with protesters calling for funding cuts to their local police departments.
Mr. de Blasio faces a June 30 deadline for delivering the city budget to the New York City Council for approval. According to preliminary estimates, he faces a shortfall of up to $1.3 billion in a roughly $89.3 billion budget, largely from the new coronavirus pandemic, which led to a lockdown for more than two months. The city has recorded more than 17,000 confirmed virus-related deaths, by far the most in the U.S. It also lost some 885,000 private-sector jobs in April.


Letting the Docs Dispense
Instead of forcing patients to stand in line at a drugstore to fill their prescriptions, it would be easier and cheaper if these patients could get their meds directly from the doctors prescribing them. No doubt that's why only six states—Montana, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New Hampshire—insist on the added cost and delay of forcing patients to make a separate trip to the pharmacy. The Institute for Justice says this is ridiculous and wants to change it.
On June 15, IJ will sue in Montana on behalf of three doctors who seek the freedom to dispense "non-controlled medications directly to their patients at cost." The suit notes that Montana's ban already allows doctors to dispense in certain cases, such as in emergencies or rural areas where there's no pharmacy within 10 miles. If doctors are qualified in these cases, what sense does it make to disqualify everyone else based on geography?
The Montana suit follows a similar suit IJ filed in Texas last year, which is still pending. In both cases the Institute's argument is that these bans insert a needless middleman—the pharmacies—into the process. The pharmacies argue this is about health and safety, because they have stronger protocols for handling medicines. But a 2014 National Evaluation of Prescriber Drug Dispensing study from Utah, for example, found an identical 7% adverse drug reaction rate whether the meds came from doctors or pharmacies.
There's also cost. The three Montana doctors are asking only to dispense at cost, much cheaper than going to a pharmacy. According to a 2017 review in the Annals of Internal Medicine, from 20% to 30% of prescriptions never get filled. This suggests that making it cheaper and easier for patients to get their meds probably means more people will take them—leading to better health outcomes.
Surely doctors in Montana and Texas are as qualified as those in the 44 states without bans. "The state of Texas trusts me to operate on patients' eyes," says Kristin Held, a San Antonio ophthalmologist who is a party to IJ's Texas lawsuit. "Why don't they trust me to hand them a bottle of their eyedrops that I have prescribed?"


Warning a Rogue Court
President Trump takes a lot of flak for his blunderbuss hostility to international organizations, but he's aiming for the right target with the new sanctions he threatened Thursday against the International Criminal Court. Someone needs to rein in the ICC and it might as well be Washington.
The order allows the Justice, State and Treasury departments to impose financial sanctions or travel bans on any ICC officials who attempt to prosecute Americans. It expands on a previous round of travel restrictions on some ICC officials introduced last year. The immediate goal is to block an investigation the ICC started in 2017 into supposed war crimes in Afghanistan. That investigation is both vexatious and silly. U.S. officials accused of crimes already are subject to American law, while the ICC somehow thinks the Taliban will care if officials in the Hague prosecute the terrorists for genocide.
The bigger aim of Thursday's sanctions is to defend American sovereignty, and that of allies such as Israel that are also targeted by the court. The U.S. is not a party to the ICC, and both Republican and Democratic administrations have long worried the court would expose American officials to politicized lawfare investigations.
Sure enough, Attorney General William Barr said Thursday the Administration believes Russia may be exerting undue influence on the court to tie down American officials in a long, costly and pointless Afghanistan prosecution. Mr. Barr also said he's seen evidence of financial improprieties by court officials. If that's true, the lack of effective accountability counts as another strike against the court's legitimacy.
The Trump Administration would perform a public service by releasing whatever evidence it has of alleged wrongdoing at the court. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's order is a vital defense of the constitutional rights of American citizens to have criminal complaints against them adjudicated in impartial, democratically legitimate courts.


Texas Prosecutor Says Officer Who Arrested George Floyd Likely Lied in 2004 Case
Houston's top prosecutor has concluded that a scandal-ridden former Houston police officer likely lied when he arrested George Floyd on a minor drug offense for which Mr. Floyd served time in state jail.
The Harris County District Attorney, Kim Ogg, also said that due to her office's examination of Mr. Floyd's case it could expand a continuing investigation to examine more arrests made by Gerald Goines, who was charged with murder after a botched drug raid in 2019 in which two people were killed.
Mr. Goines—who also is charged with tampering with a government record by lying to obtain the search warrant that authorized the deadly 2019 raid—is the officer who arrested Mr. Floyd in 2004 over what Ms. Ogg described as a one-rock, $10 crack buy. Mr. Goines's criminal case is pending. He has pleaded not guilty.
Ms. Ogg's statements suggest that years before Mr. Floyd was killed by a former Minneapolis police officer with a history of complaints on his record, he may have been set up by a Houston officer with a notorious background.
"Goines was likely lying in this case," she said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, pointing to several red flags, including that the deal was "very small time" and that Mr. Goines was the only police-officer witness. "These are not cases that we would take or that we would accept for charges under my administration."


Trump Calls for GOP to Update Platform After Party Carries Over 2016 Plan
President Trump said he would like to see "a new and updated" Republican party platform, after the Republican National Committee said it would carry over the 2016 plan this year.
Mr. Trump tweeted Friday morning: "The Republican Party has not yet voted on a Platform. No rush. I prefer a new and updated Platform, short form, if possible."
The RNC executive committee voted Wednesday evening on rules for the 2020 convention, which will hold official business in Charlotte, N.C., in August with a limited number of delegates, and the big convention events, including Mr. Trump's acceptance speech, in Jacksonville, Fla.
RNC rules state that if the committee determines the national convention cannot convene or is unable to conduct business in the convention site or city—meaning Charlotte—then only the roll call for nominating a candidate for president and vice president is allowed. That will happen with a limited number of in-person delegates in Charlotte.
The events in Jacksonville are officially being called a "celebration" of Mr. Trump being renominated.


Breaking With Tradition, Some Judges Speak Out on Racial Injustices
WASHINGTON—As demonstrations after George Floyd's killing in police custody unfolded across the nation last week, the chief justice of North Carolina weighed in with her own declaration—the first in a wave of extraordinary statements by jurists around the country.
"In our courts, African-Americans are more harshly treated, more severely punished and more likely to be presumed guilty," Chief Justice Cheri Beasley said, standing in her Raleigh, N.C., courtroom.
"These protests are a resounding, national chorus of voices whose lived experiences reinforce the notion that black people are ostracized, cast out, and dehumanized," she said. "As chief justice, it is my responsibility to take ownership of the way our courts administer justice, and acknowledge that we must do better, we must be better."
Within days, state supreme courts and chief justices around the country began to echo Chief Justice Beasley's call, issuing their own statements on what they said was the judiciary's role in perpetuating injustices and pledging to root out racial bias.
"I have heard from lots of courts and chiefs across the nation since I made my statement, and many of them have said that my statement inspired them to speak out," she said.


Kneeling Protest, Once a Flashpoint, Now a Widespread Symbol of Solidarity
WASHINGTON—At protests across the country, images of police officers taking a knee have gone viral. On Capitol Hill, congressional Democrats knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds Monday in memory of George Floyd.
Nearly four years after Colin Kaepernick was shunned by National Football League owners for taking a knee during the national anthem, the gesture he popularized is slowly being embraced amid a nationwide reckoning over police violence and racial justice stemming from the May 25 killing of Mr. Floyd.
To some observers, the recent pervasiveness of kneeling is one indication of how swiftly the Black Lives Matter movement has influenced public views on issues of race in American institutions. But civil-rights advocates and protesters say they want the show of solidarity to translate into action.
"The devil has always been in the delivery," said Harry Edwards, a civil-rights activist and sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Edwards posed the question: Are people and institutions trying to usurp power within the movement, or are they joining the struggle?
"That is determined ultimately not by whether or not the police officers, the mayors and the speaker of the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., are taking a knee in protest of George Floyd, but on what they deliver," he said.


New Rules for Covid Summer: Be Flexible and Vigilant
America is entering a complicated new phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. The remainder of 2020 warrants flexibility and tolerance, trying different ways to adapt to new evidence. In a country with such fractured politics, this will be no small challenge.
That challenge is a function of a complicated public-health picture combined with contradictory public attitudes. Even as economic activity is resuming, Covid cases are rising in about a dozen states. This isn't a second wave; it's a series of spikes off the first surge. In the coming months, some states will see infections rise while others fall. The trick will be to manage the constant risk of Covid while restarting normal life.
Policy makers are inclined to react to this challenge by looking for exactly the right set of rules to impose. But that overestimates how much of the country's response to the virus has been a matter of policy, in the traditional sense. A lot of the hand-wringing about whether the shutdowns were justified makes the same mistake.
It is clear in retrospect that there wasn't much of a choice about whether to shut down. Public fear of the virus drove the closures. Travel and consumer activity collapsed well before governors intervened. If the country hadn't shut down in March, we would have surely shut down by April when Covid deaths reached 3,000 a day. This is what happened in the U.K., where policy makers tried to avoid shutdowns but soon discovered the public wouldn't let them.
Officials reacted to public fears, formalizing what people had started doing on their own. That inevitably led to some needlessly crude and arbitrary enforcement measures, which rubbed some people the wrong way. But it essentially involved turning the public's revealed preferences into a policy framework.


Navy Won't Reinstate Captain of USS Theodore Roosevelt
The Navy concluded Friday that it shouldn't reinstate Capt. Brett Crozier as commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the ship at the center of the largest coronavirus outbreak to strike the U.S. military.
The ruling marks a reversal from two months ago when the Navy said Capt. Crozier should be reinstated. Adm. Mike Gilday, who had recommended a return to command, said a subsequent investigation found that Capt. Crozier had made several mistakes as the outbreak spread through the aircraft carrier and that he was part of the "paralysis of that command team."
"If Capt. Crozier were still in command today, I would be relieving him," Adm. Gilday said.
The Navy also said that the promotion of Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, who was in charge of the strike group that included the carrier, would be delayed "pending further investigation" but didn't offer any specifics.
The decision by Adm. Gilday was the latest twist in a series of investigations, resignations and firings following the virus's rapid spread among nearly 5,000 crew members aboard the vessel after a port visit in Vietnam in March. The outbreak forced the nuclear-powered carrier to dock for weeks as roughly 1,200 sailors recovered from the virus.


Toppling of Statues Triggers Reckoning Over Nation's History
Activists across the country are targeting statues of former U.S. presidents and other well-known figures, escalating a campaign that previously focused on Confederate generals and prompting a national reckoning over the value and meaning of historical monuments.
As protests over racial injustice continue in major U.S. cities, activists have forcefully removed statues and monuments honoring historical figures who owned slaves or participated in the oppression of minority groups.
In Portland, Ore., last week, protesters tore down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom owned slaves.
And in Washington on Monday, activists tried to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson but were blocked by police.
"When I look at these statues of white supremacists, it is just a constant reminder of the struggle that my ancestors had to face," said Kerrigan Williams, a co-founder of the Freedom Fighters DC activist group, who said she was struck in the knee with a baton by a police officer while she was filming a black demonstrator being apprehended at the Monday night protest.


Coronavirus Cases Hit Daily Records in Some U.S. States
New coronavirus cases spiked in several states, with Arizona, Texas and California reporting new daily records of infections Tuesday, prompting elected officials to tighten rules on gatherings and strongly urge people to stay home and follow social-distancing guidelines.
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases world-wide surpassed 9.1 million, with more than 2.3 million cases in the U.S., as the nation's death toll reached more than 121,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The two most populous states in the country, California and Texas, each reported more than 5,000 new infections, breaking previous daily records they had set.
On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said that he didn't want to backtrack on reopening Texas and that residents would need to take it upon themselves to wear masks and practice social distancing. But on Tuesday he urged Texans to take greater precautions, saying people shouldn't go out unless absolutely necessary.
"The safest place for you is at home," Mr. Abbott said.


FBI Highlights Lone Actors in Protest Violence
As civil unrest has swept much of the U.S., federal authorities have arrested dozens of people around the country for alleged crimes during protests.
In the past week alone, the Justice Department announced charges against a 27-year old man who allegedly tried to steal prescription drugs from a Walgreens in Kentucky; a 33-year-old woman in Minneapolis accused of conspiring to burn down an Enterprise Rent-a-Car location; and an 18-year-old man in Tennessee who allegedly tried to incite a riot at a local mall. All are federal crimes.
"If we get 300 people we can raid the mall and everything in there.." the Tennessee man posted on Snapchat, adding, "be there by 10:30, lace your shoes, wear masks and gloves. Bring hammers bricks whatever you want."
The Kentucky man has pleaded not guilty to the charges; the others were arrested on criminal complaints and have yet to enter pleas. Authorities said the defendants were trying to use the protests as cover for their alleged crimes.
A review of recent cases and an interview Friday with senior FBI officials shows most of them, with a few exceptions, appear to be instances of people capitalizing on the chaos rather than those engaging in violence orchestrated by ideological groups.


Releasing Nonviolent Accused Makes Us Safer in Covid Era
Regarding your June 7 editorial, "Crime and the Coronavirus": Our study examined persons who were arrested and detained in a jail, many of whom are later found innocent. Pre-trial detainees are by definition not "criminals," as suggested by your editorial, but are alleged offenders. A conflation between pre-trial detainees and criminals in your editorial results in a mischaracterization of the policy implications of our findings. Our research addresses not the consequences of releasing "criminals" but the consequences of jail-community cycling due to unnecessary arrests as a driver of Covid-19 spread in communities.
A study in the American Economic Review shows that, in counties comparable to Cook County in Illinois, 42% of pre-trial detainees are not convicted of any offense. In Cook County in 2016, more than 94% of arrested individuals were arrested for nonviolent alleged crimes. There is no compelling public-safety reason to incarcerate the vast majority of these people, and their jailing now is causing harm to our communities by spreading Covid-19.
In the context of 120,000 dead Americans—a growing toll partly fueled by daily arrests of approximately 28,000 individuals in ordinary times—it may be that changes to policies that lead to arrests of non-violent alleged offenders and cycle them through jails can prevent thousands of unnecessary Covid-19 cases and deaths in American communities.

Biden Is Urged to Pick Black Woman Running Mate
WASHINGTON—Joe Biden has often spoken on the campaign trail about a January 2009 day when he waited on a train platform in Wilmington, Del., for Barack Obama, soon to be the nation's first black president, a moment that served for Mr. Biden as a sign of American progress.
Nearly a dozen years later, some Democratic women are urging Mr. Biden's campaign during phone calls, at fundraisers and in writing to be part of history again by selecting the first black woman as a vice-presidential running mate.
The push for Mr. Biden to choose a woman of color has increased in recent weeks as his search process has coincided with the wave of protests over the killing of the African-American George Floyd by a white policeman in Minneapolis last month.
"We're talking about a transformational moment, and African-American women have been transformational leaders for generations, for centuries," said Rep. Barbara Lee (D., Calif.), who has urged the Biden campaign to add a black woman to the ticket.
Mr. Biden's campaign is considering at least six African-American women for the job, according to people familiar with the search, with some further along than the others. The women include California Sen. Kamala Harris; Rep. Val Demings of Florida; former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice; Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; and Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia. Rep. Karen Bass (D., Calif.), the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, has recently begun undergoing vetting, according to two people familiar with the search process.


Pompeo Urges Iraq to Act Against Killers of Top Security Analyst
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Iraq to hold to account those responsible for the assassination of a prominent Iraqi security analyst who had been threatened by Iran-backed militias, raising pressure on the new government to rein in the powerful paramilitary groups.
Hisham al-Hashimi, a 47-year-old adviser to Iraqi officials and a vocal critic of Iran-allied militias in the country, was ambushed outside his home in Baghdad late Monday by unidentified gunmen riding motorcycles. No group claimed responsibility for the killing, but friends of the academic said he had been threatened by the Kataib Hezbollah militia.
On Wednesday, Mr. Pompeo stopped short of directly accusing Kataib Hezbollah but said Mr. Hashimi had received repeated threats from Iran-backed armed groups in the days leading up to his killing.
"The United States joins partner nations in strongly condemning his assassination and calls on the government of Iraq to bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrible crime," Mr. Pompeo said during a news conference.
The U.S. has previously blamed Kataib Hezbollah for rocket attacks against its troops in Iraq. The group is one of several with close operational and ideological ties with Iran, which has leveraged them to preserve and expand its influence in neighboring Iraq and the wider region.


Wirecard Under Criminal Scrutiny in Probe of Alleged Bank Fraud
The Justice Department is examining whether scandal-plagued German payment company Wirecard AG played a critical role in an alleged $100 million bank-fraud conspiracy connected to an online marijuana marketplace, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Two businessmen have already been charged in the alleged fraud, accused of conspiring with third-party payment processors and others to trick U.S. banks into approving credit-card payments for marijuana products. The men were able to do this, prosecutors said, by using phony companies with accounts at offshore merchant banks that in turn earned steep fees off the transactions.
The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office and the New York field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining whether Wirecard played a role in the alleged conspiracy by serving as both a payment processor and an offshore merchant bank, the people said. The authorities are also considering the possible role of several former or current top Wirecard executives, two of the people said.
The attention from U.S. authorities adds to the myriad legal woes facing Wirecard, which was once more valuable than any German bank, including Deutsche Bank AG . The company has rapidly unraveled following revelations last month that more than $2 billion it had claimed to have may never have existed.
The company hasn't been charged in the U.S. bank-fraud matter and hasn't been identified in any public court filings. When one of the two businessmen—a German e-commerce consultant—was arrested and detained in California in March, a Wirecard executive offered to help post his bail, court filings show.


Senate Banking Panel Looks to Advance Trump's Fed Nominees
The Senate Banking Committee said Friday it would vote on the nomination of two of President Trump's selections for the Federal Reserve later this month.
The announcement suggests that Republicans, who have a one-vote advantage on the panel, are prepared to advance the candidacy of Judy Shelton, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign whose heterodox policy views led to some resistance from GOP senators at her Feb. 13 confirmation hearing.
If the committee approves of Ms. Shelton and a second nominee, St. Louis Fed economist Christopher Waller, they would await a full Senate vote before joining the central bank's board. The committee vote is slated for July 21.
All 12 of the Democrats on the banking panel signed a letter to the committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), asking for a new hearing, given how dramatically the coronavirus pandemic has altered the economic outlook since Ms. Shelton's confirmation hearing this winter.
The Fed's seven-member board has played an especially important role responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The larger Federal Open Market Committee, which includes the governors plus five regional bank presidents, votes on interest rate decisions. But it is the board that decides on the emergency-lending programs the Fed has established to extend credit to companies, cities and states since the coronavirus seized up financial markets in March.


Crackdown Imperils Western Efforts to Reduce Russia's Sway in Belarus
The rapprochement between the West and Belarus, Moscow's restive ally, is hitting new turbulence as outrage grows over arrests of the country's opposition leaders and its mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Europe's longest-serving leader, in power since 1994, President Alexander Lukashenkobegan courting Washington and the European Union after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine in 2014. Eager to contain Moscow's geopolitical sway and grateful for Mr. Lukashenko's refusal to permit Russian military bases, Western nations put aside some of their qualms about the man they once ostracized as the continent's "last dictator."
The EU lifted most of its sanctions on Belarus in 2016, while the U.S. has been waiving its own more limited restrictions since 2015.
Today, most Western governments remain cautious in their criticism of Minsk, valuing Belarus's new strategic importance in the age of great-power competition. But, in a sign of spreading dismay, prominent members of the European Parliament are already pushing for new sanctions. Such calls are likely to grow louder, including in the U.S. Congress and the administration, should political repression in Belarus intensify in the run-up to the Aug. 9 presidential election.
"This makes it more difficult for the supporters of Belarus—and of course this is exactly what the Kremlin exploits," said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who served until 2017 as the commanding general of U.S. Army Europe.


Trump's Mt. Rushmore Speech and Response
Your editorial "Trump At Mount Rushmore" (July 6) has numerous references to the speech President Trump delivered there, including: "Contrary to the media reporting, the America Mr. Trump described is one of genuine racial equality and diversity." And, "Mr. Trump had the temerity to point out that the last few weeks have seen an explosion of 'cancel culture—driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees.'"
Is there anyone in this great country who is "shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees" more than President Trump?

Trump Administration Rescinds Rules on Foreign Students Studying Online
The Trump administration has agreed to rescind rules it issued last week barring international students from being in the U.S. if they were taking classes only online, a rare reversal by the government on immigration policy.
The action resolves for now a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston federal court.
It came as officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security were considering scaling back the new rules, according to people familiar with the matter. That could pave the way for the Trump administration to issue a modified policy in coming weeks. One option that the administration could still pursue would apply the more restrictive rules only to newly enrolling students, two of the people said.
At a short hearing Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs confirmed that an agreement had been reached. She said the government would rescind the policy, withdraw an FAQ detailing the rules and return to the status quo of guidance issued in the spring.
That will allow foreign students to come to or stay in the U.S. even if their schools have shifted to online-only instruction for the fall, in light of the coronavirus pandemic. It provides significant relief for schools that had been fretting over how the rules would affect enrollment for the coming fall.


The Speech Police at Princeton
When a Princeton classics professor wrote an article for the Quillette website taking issue with recent faculty demands over race, a storm of criticism descended. This was an opening for President Christopher Eisgruber and other university leaders to remind people that Princeton is a place where speech and debate are cherished. Instead, Princeton is demonstrating how a lack of leadership enables the cancel culture.
The professor is Joshua Katz, and his offending piece was headlined "A Declaration of Independence by a Princeton Professor." Mr. Katz took issue with a petition sent to President Eisgruber signed by more than 350 faculty members. The faculty letter began with the statement "Anti-Blackness is foundational to America" and included demands ranging from an extra semester of sabbatical for faculty of color to removing the statue of John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and former Princeton president who owned slaves.
Mr. Katz's capital offense was his description of the university's Black Justice League as a "local terrorist organization." This hyperbole has given critics an excuse to denounce Mr. Katz without addressing his argument. His own department accuses him of using language that has long been used to "incite racial and specifically anti-Black violence."
In a statement to the Daily Princetonian, President Eisgruber piled on: "While free speech permits students and faculty to make arguments that are bold, provocative, or even offensive, we all have an obligation to exercise that right responsibly. Joshua Katz has failed to do so, and I object personally and strongly to his false description of a Princeton student group as a 'local terrorist organization.'"
But Mr. Katz was not saying the Black Justice League is al Qaeda or the IRA. The rest of that sentence defined what he meant, calling it a group "that made life miserable for the many (including the many black students) who did not agree with its members' demands."


A Trend to Renting Homes Damages Young Families
"For Rent: The American Dream" by Ryan Dezember (Exchange, July 11) has got to be one of the most disturbing pieces published recently. If the younger generations don't have homeownership as a way to accumulate wealth, provide for themselves in retirement and pass along their savings to their descendants, their situation is dire, and the character of America is changed fundamentally. They are locked out of the middle-class life that we Americans have long aspired to.
Those who say the system is rigged are surely right in this regard, and it ought to be changed. But how? Which political party will offer a real solution to this development? It is a cause that virtually everyone could unite around. Programs like Habitat for Humanity tend in the right direction but are too small. A national effort is needed.

The Left's Rights Distortions
The State Department on Thursday unveiled a report on America's founding principles, and the news is that what should be an easy consensus is now attacked and distorted. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year empaneled a commission to highlight the importance of "unalienable rights" in U.S. foreign policy—and to explain how making all of politics a matter of rights can make the most fundamental liberties more difficult to secure.
While Mr. Pompeo's introductory speech took shots at progressive efforts to defame the American founding, the report is in no sense a partisan document or a whitewash of history. It discusses at length the way the U.S. failed to live up to its founding promise of unalienable rights—most significantly with slavery and the Jim Crow era—and emphasizes that U.S. credibility in promoting human rights abroad depends on America's example at home.
So why the ridicule from the liberal press and activists? Because the State Department commission draws a distinction between civil and political rights, such as freedom of speech and equality before the law, and "economic and social rights." The latter, like the right to a state pension or to abortion, may be valued by citizens and enacted by governments. But they are not fundamental to a free society in the same way as the unalienable rights the American founders sought to protect.
For progressives a focus on civil and political rights is hopelessly anachronistic. NPR's correspondent said, "this was supposed to be a fresh rethink on human rights in the 21st century, and yet the first thing you see in the report is a picture of the Founding Fathers." The Bill of Rights—so déclassé.
Amnesty International called Mr. Pompeo's effort "a dangerous political stunt that could spark a race to the bottom by human rights-abusing governments around the world." A Washington Post op-ed suggested Mr. Pompeo's approach is a "pretext for denying rights to people in disfavored groups."


New York City Shootings Continue to Rise Amid Anti-Violence Tactics
Shootings in New York City rose for the third weekend in a row, even as Mayor Bill de Blasio and police officials have sought to implement new programs to stop the violence.
Between Friday and Sunday, the city had 22 shooting incidents with 24 victims, according to figures kept by the New York Police Department. There were five incidents and five victims during the same period a year earlier.
From the start of the year through July 17, the number of shootings in the city has increased by 66.8%, compared with the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, the number of shooting victims has grown by 77.5%, according to the NYPD. Some violent crime has increased as the city began easing lockdown restrictions over the new coronavirus in early June.
Mr. de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea on Friday introduced new tactics to curb violence, including deploying additional officers to areas where shootings have taken place, and increasing efforts to foster coordination between police and communities.
Mr. de Blasio said at a press conference Monday that these efforts have already begun to yield results, but other issues, including delays in prosecutions and other factors associated with the new coronavirus pandemic, have hampered progress.


Alaska's Election Initiative Is Rank
The Covid crisis has increased interest in improving America's election system. But not all election reforms would make things better.
Here in Alaska, a Colorado-based political-action committee, Unite America, spent more than $1 million to place the so-called Better Elections initiative on the November ballot. It's a bad plan.
The voting process in Alaska, as in most states, is simple: Voters pick one candidate for each office, and the candidate with the most votes wins. The initiative would introduce a confusing new system called ranked-choice voting. Voters would receive a grid to rank multiple candidates. If no candidate receives a majority of "first place" votes, the lowest-ranked candidate would be eliminated. Votes would be retabulated based on second choices—then third and fourth ones until a "majority" emerges.
Jason McDaniel, a political scientist at San Francisco State University, found that ranked-choice voting decreased turnout by 3 to 5 percentage points on average in cities that implemented it. Mr. McDaniel was blunt in his conclusion, telling the New York Times : "My research shows that when you make things more complicated, which this does, there's going be lower turnout."
Voters may also be discouraged to learn their ballots may not count at all in the final vote. If you pick only one candidate and decline to rank the others, and your candidate is eliminated, your ballot is thrown out under what's called "ballot exhaustion." A 2014 study of four cities' ranked-choice elections, published in the journal Electoral Studies, found that up to 27% of ballots were "exhausted" and thus excluded from the final vote total.


Democrats Fend Off Attempts to Back Medicare for All in Platform
Democrats rejected efforts to amend the party's platform to show support for Medicare for All and legalizing marijuana, as they moved the document closer to adoption by delegates to next month's convention.
The document, approved Monday by the party's platform committee, aligns closely with presumptive nominee Joe Biden's campaign proposals. The next step is for the platform to be voted on by nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates, which they will do by mail ahead of the convention where Mr. Biden is set to be formally named the party's nominee.
The party platform is largely symbolic, as Democratic candidates don't have to endorse its contents. Still, it is an official marker of the party's priorities and policy goals.
The committee meeting Monday was held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic and avoided some of the more heated discussions that have occurred during in-person platform talks in the past. However, some areas of disagreement were on display.
Delegates overwhelmingly opposed an amendment in support of the Medicare for All system pushed by allies of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Platform committee members also shot down other attempts to move the party's position closer to endorsing single-payer health care, such as by expanding Medicare to children and people over age 55.


At John Lewis's Funeral, Obama, Clinton and Bush Pay Tribute
WASHINGTON—Former President Barack Obama on Thursday heralded the late Rep. John Lewis as a "founding father" whose legacy of activism transformed American democracy, while warning that the nation must remain "vigilant against the darker currents of this country's history."
Paying tribute to Mr. Lewis along with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was once a co-pastor, Mr. Obama said Mr. Lewis was perhaps Dr. King's "finest disciple."
"America was built by John Lewises," he said. "When we do form a more perfect union, whether it's years from now or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries, John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America."
The funeral service capped off a week of events honoring Mr. Lewis, a civil-rights icon and longtime Democratic lawmaker who died July 17 of pancreatic cancer at age 80.
Messrs. Bush, Clinton and other prominent speakers also paid tribute to Mr. Lewis's role in ushering in a landmark voting-rights law and his decades of service in Congress. Mr. Lewis had represented an Atlanta-area district since 1987.


Notable & Quotable: Self-Righteous Anger
Theodore Dalrymplewriting in the New Criterion's June issue:
I don't know whether you have ever experienced a still small voice at the back of your head . . . telling you that you are enjoying your own anger, an enjoyment which renders it dishonest, but even more do people enjoy being angry in a supposedly good cause. Their anger gives them, at least in their own estimation, rights which they do not possess in a state of equanimity. Their righteous anger allows them with a good conscience to do what they would not normally do, especially when they are in the anonymizing company of many others of like mind. Their righteous indignation gives them the locus standi to throw a brick through a plate glass window.


Trump Prepares Executive Actions as Coronavirus-Aid Talks Stall
WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was prepared to move forward with executive orders to provide more coronavirus aid to Americans, after White House negotiations with Democrats made no progress toward agreements on unemployment benefits and state and local aid, two of the central issues in the talks.
Mr. Trump said he was set to take executive action to suspend the payroll tax, retroactive to July 1 and running through the end of the year. He also said he intended to extend recently expired jobless payments through December, but he declined to say how large the payments would be. He reiterated that he would impose a partial moratorium on evictions and assist with student-loan payments.
"If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need," said Mr. Trump, in remarks from his club in Bedminster, N.J. He said the orders were being drafted, and he expected potential legal challenges if he moved ahead.
The White House has provided little detail about how it would pay for additional aid without an act of Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) have said executive orders would accomplish little. In a statement, they said a reliance on executive orders by Mr. Trump would be "unworkable, weak and narrow," and no substitute for fuller legislation.
Negotiators have been struggling for weeks to bridge the divide between a Democratic $3.5 trillion aid bill, passed by the House in May, and Senate Republicans' $1 trillion proposal unveiled last week.


U.S. Covid-19 Death Toll Tops 160,000
The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic passed 160,000, as parts of the country showed signs that the virus's spread was easing.
The U.S. reported more than 59,000 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, the total number of confirmed cases surpassed 19 million, with the U.S. making up about a quarter of the tally.
Nine states, Vermont, Texas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois and Hawaii, have seen the seven-day average of new confirmed cases rising faster than the two-week average as of Aug. 6, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data. That held true in 40 states a month earlier, so the data reflect declines in reported new cases in a swath of the country.
The seven-day average for new cases has been falling for about two weeks, from around 67,000 on July 22 to 55,510 on Thursday. Since July 26, the seven-day average has been less than the 14-day average, a signal that case counts broadly are coming down. Comparing the one- and two-week averages of new cases helps smooth out anomalies in the data, such as lags behind in reporting.
However, the recent drop in the number of reported cases could be tied in part to a decline in testing. In 25 states, the seven-day average number of tests per 1,000 people was down from a week earlier, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Testing and contact tracing are seen as essential to containing the virus. But demand has outstripped supply.


Trump's Opening in Africa
There isn't much good news in the world these days, but a potential bright spot is Sudan. The U.S. has a chance to pull the northeast African nation closer to the West if it doesn't blow the moment.
The opening comes from the fall last year of Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled for 30 years and turned Sudan into a pariah state. Mass protests led to his arrest last year, and a transitional government has taken power. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is a respected technocrat, and a Sovereign Council includes civilians and military officials. The government says elections will come in 2022.
Problematic figures have retained some power, but Mr. Hamdok has broken an infamous security service and repealed restrictive Islamic laws. The press and broader civil society have more space to operate. Mr. Hamdok survived an assassination attempt by Islamic militants this year, and the generals who ousted Mr. Bashir aren't committed democrats.
Enter the U.S., which can help shore up Mr. Hamdok's position. Mr. Bashir gave refuge to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in the 1990s, and Sudan earned a state sponsor of terrorism designation in 1993. After more than 200 people died during an attack on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, Sudan became even more isolated. Mr. Bashir's ouster has created an opportunity to overhaul the relationship.
The State Department has negotiated a settlement with Sudan that would provide some $335 million in compensation for victims of the embassy attacks in exchange for removing the country's terror designation. Congress needs to approve the deal, which would give the country immunity from future terrorism-related lawsuits. "This is an opportunity that doesn't come along often," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said recently. "There's a chance not only for democracy, but perhaps regional opportunities." Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt support the deal and would benefit from a more stable region.


Democratic Taiwan Stands With Hong Kong
After disqualifying the pro-democracy candidates running in Hong Kong's supposedly democratic election, Beijing and its delegates now have postponed the election itself ("The China Vise Tightens on Hong Kong," Review & Outlook, Aug. 3).
On the front lines of the fight for democracy and freedom, Taiwan sympathizes deeply with the Hong Kong people and supports their democratic aspirations. We are also keenly aware that Beijing's boldness and apparent disregard for global opinion do not bode well for the region or the world.
Beijing has already managed to imprison Lee Ming-che, a Taiwanese activist, simply for discussing the subject of democracy on the internet with his Chinese friends—while he was in Taiwan, no less. Now, Beijing has reneged on its treaty obligations regarding Hong Kong's autonomy. Sound familiar? Remember its promise not to militarize the South China Sea? Imagine what could come next.
China's aggressive behavior must not be tolerated any longer. If the world wants a rules-based, liberal international order, then it will want more democracies, not fewer.

America's Surprising Recovery After V-J Day
This weekend marks the 75th anniversary of V-J Day, the end of World War II. In addition to the victory, Americans should honor the remarkable process that led to it: the rapid transformation of the economy from a Depression-era catastrophe into what President Franklin D. Roosevelt rightly termed the "arsenal of democracy."
The war ended more quickly than expected, with the unleashing of two atomic bombs on Japan in August 1945. On Sept. 2, Japan formalized its surrender. What came next in the U.S. was equally impressive: the speedy transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.
It's hard to believe in retrospect, but many Americans assumed the end of the war would mean a resumption of the Depression, which was cut off by the World War II military buildup. In the middle of the fighting, America's leading Keynesian economist, Alvin Hansen of Harvard, said: "When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove economic controls." That's precisely what happened with almost no notice.
When the sudden end of combat became apparent in late August 1945, economist Everett Hagen predicted that the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 1946 would be 14.8%. Millions of military personnel did become jobless within months and defense spending plummeted, putting more out of work. In June 1946 federal employment was almost precisely 10 million less than a year earlier. Yet the sharp rise in overall unemployment didn't occur. The total unemployment rate for 1946 was 3.9%—almost precisely the same rate the U.S. had this February before the pandemic's effects were felt.
Part of the reason was that some workers in the war effort wanted to revert to their civilian roles as parents, housewives and students, so the supply of labor fell. But just as critically, market adjustments prevented massive joblessness. Unemployment exists when the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at prevailing wage levels. To alleviate unemployment, real wages (adjusted for changes in worker productivity) need to fall. That happened in 1946, aided by rising productivity as resources moved from public to more-efficient private uses, with fewer wage and price controls.


Sharpton and Surprises
It's been a fascinating week in U.S. politics, featuring the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Los Angeles Times launching separate rhetorical attacks on "progressive" Democrats from the right. Now it appears that Americans are even beginning to see justice served for the abuses of federal surveillance powers against the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. Miracles haven't ceased and the week isn't over yet.
As for Rev. Sharpton, he was on MSNBC this week opposing the defunding of police, a key demand of the Black Lives Matter organization. He also raised the question of exactly which lives are behind the movement to gut U.S. police departments.
Mr. Sharpton charged that some people are trying to "hijack" a movement intended to improve policing and redirect it toward the dangerous goal of removing police from the streets. Given his history, no doubt many readers would question whether Mr. Sharpton has valuable suggestions for improving U.S. policing.
But he is no doubt speaking for many Americans when he says people want to be protected from both "bad cops and bad citizens" who are not cops. On MSNBC he called out "those that have no identity with the communities, that don't live in any of the danger" but who are trying to "put us in harm's way to fix some purist latte liberalism that they advocate." He added that the defunders often make demands about dismantling police forces and then travel to the Hamptons to read their "so-called progressive literature to each other."

New Jersey Supreme Court Curbs Power of Newark's Police Oversight Board
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the investigative powers of Newark's civilian-complaint review board were too broad, dealing a blow to advocates calling for greater police accountability.
The state's top court said Wednesday in a 6-1 ruling that state law permits the creation of civilian review boards that can investigate citizen complaints alleging police misconduct and recommend disciplinary action to the police department's public-safety director.
But the court stripped Newark's review board of its authority to issue subpoenas while investigating police misconduct. The court said no state law exists that would allow the city to grant this authority to the board.
State law also bars the board from conducting an investigation when the Newark Police Department is leading a concurrent probe into the same matter, the court said.
The board must adhere to existing state laws, "despite the sound intentions to address municipal and community concerns in Newark," Justice Jaynee LaVecchia wrote in the court's opinion.


Political Giving Should Be Private
A third of Americans fear being fired for their political beliefs. Unfortunately, for those who wish to support political campaigns, federal and state laws leave no place to hide.
"Cancel culture" has divided First Amendment advocates. Some argue that private actors must tolerate differing views for free speech to survive, while others say the only concern should be government intrusions on speech. But when private individuals target and harass other Americans for their political donations, the government can't say it plays no role.
Campaign contributions are public because the law requires it. Every American who gives more than $200 to a candidate for president or Congress, or to a political party, has his name, address and employer published in an online, searchable database. Every state has similar laws for reporting contributions to state candidates, many with substantially lower donation thresholds.
It wasn't always this way. The earliest laws mandating that donations be reported date only from the late 19th century, and weren't seriously enforced, by states or Congress, until the 1970s. Even then accessing reports required visiting a government office and digging through paper or microfiche records. Unless donors' contributions caught the attention of investigative journalists, few were widely exposed.
Today, the laws haven't changed, but the technological and cultural landscapes have shifted dramatically. Anyone can look up your donations in seconds. Most Americans still prefer to judge candidates through news coverage and campaign materials. But others regularly mine these databases not so much to inform their decisions but to gain information that can be used to harm candidates—and, more important, donors to candidates—that they oppose.


U.S. Imposes Sanctions on International Criminal Court Officials
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions against two senior officials of the International Criminal Court for prosecuting U.S. military and intelligence personnel in Afghanistan.
The Treasury Department placed ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and head of ICC jurisdiction Phakiso Mochochoko on its blacklist Wednesday under an executive order issued in June that said the ICC's efforts threatened U.S. officials without legitimate jurisdiction, infringed on U.S. sovereignty and put at risk critical national security and foreign policy.
The sanctions represent an escalating fight with the ICC and its supporters over an investigation by its prosecutors for charges of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity against U.S. personnel in Afghanistan since May 2003. The ICC began the investigation in 2017 and has since said it has received more than 700 complaints by alleged victims.
In a statement, the ICC condemned the U.S. measures, characterizing them as "coercive acts" and pledged to support its employees and continue its work.
The sanctions and visa restrictions, the court said, "are another attempt to interfere with the Court's judicial and prosecutorial independence and crucial work to address grave crimes of concern to the international community as mandated under the ICC Rome Statute."


Scheming at the Latin Development Bank
One reason to be suspicious of international aid institutions is that they too often become vehicles that serve everyone but the poor. A good example is playing out now at the Inter-American Development Bank, where a club of Latin cronies is trying to derail President Trump's nominee to run the place.
Mr. Trump's nominee for bank president is Mauricio Claver-Carone. He's the former U.S. executive director at the International Monetary Fund and now works at the White House National Security Council. Mr. Claver-Carone has the votes to be elected when the board meets Sept. 12. But a small group of countries are trying to derail the vote to block his reform agenda.
The IDB's ostensible goal is reducing poverty by promoting economic growth in Latin America, which is in U.S. interests. Think about the destabilizing effects of migration crises. The U.S. has a 30% stake in the bank that last year made $13 billion in loans and guarantees in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the bank has little to show for more than 60 years of lending. Instead it has become a jobs program for friends of the influential.
Mr. Claver-Carone has promised to make IDB management look more like the region by naming to top posts Central American and Caribbean candidates along with South Americans from some small countries—all of which have long been under-represented. He has pledged to increase transparency and end the bank's China-centric policies. He also has committed to a single five-year term and to implement term limits for future presidents.
This agenda threatens current IDB beneficiaries, especially certain nongovernmental organizations. Inter-American Dialogue President Michael Shifter recently argued against Mr. Claver-Carone in the Foreign Policy website without disclosing that his organization received more than $100,000 in grants and contributions from the IDB in 2017 and 2018. In polite circles that's known as a conflict of interest. George Soros's Open Society Foundation and the Ford Foundation also gave the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue more than $100,000 over the same period, according to the Dialogue's biennial report.


Size of California Wildfires Surpasses Annual Record
Powerful windstorms in California are creating more dangerous conditions as firefighters work to contain wildfires that have already blackened a record 2.3 million acres.
Red-flag warnings for high fire conditions were posted across the state, as a forecast for strong winds through Wednesday put pressure on 14,000 firefighters battling 25 major blazes that have killed at least eight people and destroyed more than 3,400 structures.
The total number of acres burned by wildfires this year is already more than in any total year previously recorded, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday, going back to 1932 when records began. Last year at the same time, fires had blackened only 118,000 acres. "It's rather extraordinary the challenge that we face again so far this season," Mr. Newsom said in a briefing Tuesday.
PG&E Corp. late Monday began cutting power in parts of Northern California, as part of its plan to help prevent the kind of massive fires its equipment has caused in the past.
Officials on Tuesday were particularly concerned about the wind's impact on two infernos. The Creek Fire in the Sierra National Forest above Fresno, Calif., has torn through 143,929 acres of forest and sent smoke clouds as high as 9 miles since breaking out on Friday. It was 0% contained on Tuesday. The El Dorado Fire, which has burned 10,574 acres since Saturday in San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, is 16% contained.


Dallas Police Chief Resigns Following Concerns Over Use of Force
Dallas Police Chief U. Reneé Hall on Tuesday submitted a resignation letter, following a backlash against her department's handling of protests.
Dallas, like other cities, saw widespread demonstrations against police brutality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Several of Dallas's City Council members said last month at a Public Safety Committee meeting they had lost trust in Ms. Hall's leadership. They cited a lack of transparency regarding the force police used, which injured some protesters with less-lethal munitions.
In her resignation letter, Ms. Hall said she was proud of the overhauls to Dallas policing during her tenure and has "received a number of inquiries about future career opportunities."
Ms. Hall, who was hired three years ago, was the city's first Black female chief and a supporter of increased police oversight.


Woodward Book Shows Unguarded Trump on North Korea, Race Issues
WASHINGTON—President Trump bragged that he had saved a Saudi crown prince who the CIA concluded ordered the murder of a U.S. journalist and prominent Saudi critic. He derided U.S. generals as a "bunch of pussies," while his son-in-law and senior adviser dismissed some early White House officials as "overconfident idiots." And some of Mr. Trump's top advisers last year discussed the possible need to speak out about what they viewed as the dangers of his presidency.
That is according to "Rage" by Bob Woodward, which is based on 18 interviews he conducted with Mr. Trump and interviews with firsthand participants and witnesses, according to the author.
Recordings published on Wednesday of Mr. Woodward's interviews with the president revealed that Mr. Trump in March told the journalist he was deliberately playing down the severity of coronavirus to avoid inciting panic, even as he publicly dismissed the virus's threat in a way public-health experts say harmed the nation's ability to restrict its spread. He also told Mr. Woodward on Feb. 7 that the virus was "deadly stuff"—weeks before he publicly acknowledged the threat posed by the virus.
Mr. Trump has called the book a "political hit-job." The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on a detailed list of Mr. Woodward's allegations.

A Plea to Save New York
New York City's lockdown and violent crime spike have driven away many office workers, and on Thursday business honchos finally told Mayor Bill de Blasio that they'll be reluctant to return unless he cleans up the streets. What took them so long?
"We need to send a strong, consistent message that our employees, customers, clients and visitors will be coming back to a safe and healthy work environment," some 160 business leaders in the Partnership for New York City implored Mr. de Blasio in a letter. "People will be slow to return unless their concerns about security and the livability of our communities are addressed quickly and with respect and fairness for our city's diverse populations."
That's putting it gently. Mr. de Blasio's two terms have been a slow-rolling disaster that New Yorkers experience on a daily basis from rising vagrancy and public drug use to faltering subways, a public housing scandal, and failing schools. The city's prolonged economic lockdown, new state bail law that makes it harder to hold suspects after arrest, and a $1 billion cut to the police budget have magnified the growing public disorder.
A 25-year-old woman on a recent Saturday morning was assaulted on a subway platform in Manhattan's business district. Women have complained about being stalked by homeless men whom the city has put up in nearby hotels. Last month a man on his way to work was randomly shot in the arm in Grand Central Terminal. Meantime, hundreds of businesses have shuttered, many permanently, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo has reopened only very slowly. New York City's French bakery chain Maison Kayser declared bankruptcy this week, and New York Sports Club said it plans to file as well.
Gyms in the city were only allowed to reopen at 33% capacity last week, and Mr. Cuomo finally relented to letting indoor dining at 25% capacity on Sept. 30. The Partnership for New York City has estimated that a third of small businesses will close permanently. New York City's unemployment rate was 19.8% in July, one of the highest rates in the country.


For Doctor in India, Coronavirus Waves Just Keep Coming
NEW DELHI—For many countries, battling the coronavirus has been a sprint to bring infections under control, then a struggle to keep it that way. In India, it has turned out to be a marathon.
No one knows that better than Dr. Santhosh Kumar, a 48-year-old infectious disease specialist who treated some of the country's first infections back in February. He is still fighting the virus, these days building a 10,000-strong corps of health-care workers and volunteers in southern India to tackle yet another wave of infections.
In a country that could wind up with more infections than any other before the global pandemic is over, a marathon battle with the virus is a future that he is both resigned to and determined to confront.
"Coronavirus is not a disease that will be wiped out in a vast country like India. In India, there will be wave after wave," he says.
As Indian authorities steadily expand testing and the virus spreads beyond the cities, the country has surpassed Brazil to have the second largest number of total recorded infections, with nearly 4.7 million as of Saturday. The average number of new daily cases in India recently surpassed the U.S. to lead the world, making India the hottest of the global hot spots for the virus. And although India's cumulative total of cases is still just half that of the U.S., India's stretched health-care system and massive population—at 1.3 billion, four times the size of the U.S.—make it all but inevitable India will eventually surpass the U.S. in total cases.


How 'Emergency Use' Can Help Roll Out a Covid Vaccine
A vaccine for Covid-19 could emerge in the next several months. But first, clinical trials need to reach completion showing that the vaccines reduce Covid. The data must undergo multiple layers of scientific review to weigh risks against benefits. This includes careful analysis by career experts at the Food and Drug Administration, independent safety monitors, scientists who work for the vaccine manufacturer, and outside experts who advise the FDA.
In a highly politicized environment, many Americans are understandably concerned about cutting corners. But the FDA's career experts have publicly and clearly affirmed their commitment to the gold standard for review. As former FDA commissioners, we are confident in the FDA's career scientists to oversee vaccine development rigorously.
If a Covid vaccine clears this process, it could be made available initially to specific groups of people through an Emergency Use Authorization. This emergency authority enables the FDA to make products available before a full application is approved by the agency. Congress created the emergency-use pathway as part of the Project BioShield Act of 2004, which provided for the development of medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. Following 9/11 and anthrax, lawmakers expected an urgent need for such defenses.
After the 2009 swine flu, Congress expanded this pathway in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013, a bipartisan measure aimed at preparing the country to weather a pandemic. The law streamlined the application process for emergency use, expanded the classes of drugs eligible, and broadened the testing the FDA could require.
To receive an authorization for emergency use, a developer must demonstrate that—based on the totality of scientific evidence—the products's known or potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. Some worry that this is a lower standard for access that shouldn't be applied to a vaccine, where the bar for safety needs to be high, as vaccines are given to the healthy. But the FDA has latitude to apply the standard appropriately to different settings—in particular, requiring more-rigorous evidence for treatments used on healthier populations than for seriously ill hospitalized patients.


South Dakota Attorney General Struck and Killed Pedestrian
SIOUX FALLS, S.D.—State investigators say South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg reported hitting a deer with his car on Saturday night but actually struck and killed a pedestrian whose body wasn't found until the next day.
Mr. Ravnsborg's office has said he immediately called 911 after the accident and didn't realize he had hit a man until the pedestrian's body was discovered. The Department of Public Safety issued a statement Monday that said only that Mr. Ravnsborg told the Hyde County Sheriff's Office that he had hit a deer and didn't say whether he reported the crash in a 911 call.
The victim, who was identified as 55-year-old Joseph Boever, wasn't found until Sunday morning.
Republican Gov. Kristi Noem revealed Sunday that Mr. Ravnsborg was involved in a fatal crash and said the Department of Public Safety was investigating, but neither she nor the agency provided any details about what happened.
Mr. Ravnsborg had issued a statement Sunday saying he was "shocked and filled with sorrow" but also hadn't revealed details. His office said Monday that he hadn't been drinking before the crash.


Amid Coronavirus, Jewish High Holidays Take a Different Shape
Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who leads the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, recently organized a drive-up distribution of special prayer books so his congregation can follow along at home while he live-streams services for the Jewish High Holidays from his living room, which has become his makeshift studio.
He sounded the shofar, a ram's horn, as they arrived and handed out small jars of honey to symbolize hope for the new year, Rosh Hashanah, and a special booklet honoring the 11 people killed in a shooting at the synagogue two years ago. Rabbi Myers will remember them in his streamed service on Yom Kippur.
"Prayer in America is forever changed," says Rabbi Myers.
Next week marks the beginning of the latest season to be re-created against the backdrop of the pandemic. The Jewish High Holidays, starting with Rosh Hashanah at sundown on Friday and ending with Yom Kippur 10 days later, will be followed by other Christian and secular holidays, all of which will look much different as people figure out how to celebrate under new restrictions.
In the Jewish faith, this time of year is marked by large gatherings, both to pray and celebrate. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is followed by 10 days of intense reflection, ending with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. During this time even many who rarely attend services crowd synagogues and come together in homes to share dishes based on recipes passed down through generations.


Coronavirus Case Numbers Stay Elevated in Parts of Midwest
New U.S. coronavirus cases rose above 44,000 for the first time in nearly a week, with elevated numbers continuing in parts of the Midwest, as President Trump said the administration was committing to giving every American a Covid-19 vaccine by April.
The president's timeline was more ambitious than one laid out earlier this week by Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said he believed a vaccine would be available to the general public in the late second quarter or third quarter of 2021.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told The Wall Street Journal that if a vaccine candidate were determined to be safe and effective by October, it would likely be available for distribution to some vulnerable populations and early responders early next year, and distributed more widely by the middle or end of 2021.
Some companies in the vaccine race expect results from late-stage trials in the coming weeks, and drugmakers have already begun manufacturing doses so they will be ready for shipment if or when regulators authorize their use. However, state health authorities have expressed concern that the government hasn't resolved critical issues regarding distribution.
Testing: The CDC changed course again on its Covid-19 testing guidance.


Princeton's Confession of Bias
The folks at Princeton are supposed to be smart. But you have to wonder about the intelligence of inviting federal scrutiny by declaring their own school guilty of racism.
Amid a struggle session with progressive faculty and students this month, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber published an open letter promising to combat "systemic racism" at the school. That's an eye-opener since Princeton has assured students and the federal government that it doesn't discriminate. Has the university been lying?
Enter the Education Department, which wants to know. On Wednesday Assistant Secretary Robert King wrote Mr. Eisgruber requesting records related to his confession of bias. "Among other things," Mr. King writes, "you said '[r]acism and the damage it does to people of color persist at Princeton . . .' and '[r]acist assumptions . . . remain embedded in structures of the University itself.'"
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that no one on the basis of race should "be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." Colleges each year must certify to the Education Department that this is true to receive federal funds.
The department, Mr. King writes, is concerned Princeton's assurances "may have been false." He adds: "Its many nondiscrimination and equal opportunity claims to students, parents, and consumers in the market for education certificates may have been false, misleading, and actionable substantial misrepresentations in violation" of federal law.


Political Candidates Run for Office While Running Home Schools
Democrat Candace Valenzuela, running in a tight race for an open House seat as the school year kicks off, has turned her master bathroom into her campaign's nerve center.
"I can't tell you what it's like to be sitting on a yoga ball looking at your hair products and you get a call and it's 'Hello Candace, it's Joaquin Castro,' " she said, referencing the congressman who represents San Antonio. In her bathroom, away from the noise of her 5-year-old's virtual learning and her toddler's screams, she recently hosted a fundraiser on Zoom, netting $1,000 for her North Texas campaign.
Ms. Valenzuela had the option to send her older child to school in person, but opted for virtual learning so that her 71-year-old mother-in-law with health issues could continue living with them without fear of germs being brought home from school. Her mother-in-law now also helps with distance learning. Ms. Valenzuela said her best campaign purchase has been a $12 green screen for video, hung right next to the shower.
"I have to hide from my family, sometimes, to get things done," she said.
As a hectic school year kicks off for tens of millions of families across America, many challengers running for a seat in Congress feel their pain, as they enter the peak campaign season. Ambitious moms and dads are juggling their political aspirations, regular jobs and their children's schooling, while also arguing that they would help Washington shape up if voters send them to Congress. With Election Day approaching and students logging into their classes, homebound candidates and children are all competing for time, space and some peace and quiet.


Some New York Lawmakers Push to Raise Millionaires' Taxes
ALBANY, N.Y.—Progressive lawmakers and groups said New Jersey's agreement to increase taxes on millionaires should be matched in New York, and are pushing the state Legislature here to convene soon to consider a revenue package.
A coalition of advocacy groups called #FundExcludedWorkers, which includes unions representing nurses and auto workers, is planning a Friday protest along Park Avenue to call for taxing the income and wealth of billionaires.
The coalition this month bought billboard advertisements in the districts represented by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, both Democrats. Some Democratic state legislators have called for a return to the Capitol to consider tax proposals.
The novel coronavirus pandemic prompted a $14.5 billion decline in state revenues, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo has pushed off negotiations on adjusting the state budget in the hope that Congress will appropriate additional aid. The Democratic governor said last week that might mean a delay until after the November election.
But some lawmakers say New Jersey's action undercuts that argument, and they will increase pressure for action.


Government Reviewer of Bolton Book Describes Unprecedented White House Intervention
WASHINGTON—The government official assigned to examine whether former national security adviser John Bolton's book contains classified information said Trump administration lawyers asked her to sign misleading statements about her review, adding fuel to Mr. Bolton's claims that he was targeted for his unflattering portrait of President Trump.
In a 17-page letter, an attorney for Ellen Knight, the then-National Security Council official whose office conducted the review, said White House lawyers were involved to an unusual degree in the review process, withheld information and conducted a flawed second review in what appeared to be an effort to justify a lawsuit against Mr. Bolton over his book.
Lawyers for Mr. Bolton filed the letter in court on Wednesday in response to a case the Justice Department filed days before Mr. Bolton's bestseller, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," went on sale in June.
"Had their concern been to produce a publishable manuscript without classified information, they presumably would have asked the experts who had devoted hundreds of person-hours to a painstaking review of every page of the manuscript," Ms. Knight's attorney, Kenneth Wainstein, wrote.
The allegations came days after prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to Mr. Bolton's publisher and literary agent as part of a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Bolton mishandled classified information in his book, which relays stories about Mr. Bolton's time in government and his relationship with the president.


Florida Reopens
Get ready for media hyperventilating about a group of Americans who are choosing to live a full and prudent life, rather than a hysterical one. Just in time for the weekend, the citizens of Florida have been largely liberated to exercise their own good judgment when it comes to Covid-19 risks.
Ana Ceballos, Josh Solomon and Samantha Gross report in the Miami Herald:
Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday lifted all remaining coronavirus-related state restrictions on businesses such as bars and restaurants through an executive order that also suspends all fines and fees tied to social distancing enforcement.
The governor said Friday he would sign an executive order, which would take effect immediately, that will preempt local rules enforcing restaurant closures and will require municipalities to justify restrictions that don't allow restaurants to operate at a minimum 50% capacity.
"Locals can do some reasonable regulations, but you can't just say no," the governor told reporters at a news conference in St. Petersburg. "You can't say no after six months and just have people twisting in the wind."
Kudos to Gov. DeSantis for understanding that costly and indefinite prohibitions with questionable public health benefits are not sustainable or wise. By any reasonable measure, the Sunshine State has been managing its affairs better than lockdown media stars like New Jersey and New York. Florida has plenty of elderly residents, yet it has suffered fewer deaths from Covid, and on a per capita basis has far less than half the Covid deaths suffered by either New York or New Jersey. Meanwhile Floridians have also been managing to fight the virus without destroying their economy. The Sunshine State has a much lower unemployment rate than either of the lockdowners.
Still, you can expect plenty of pandemic propaganda this weekend from news outlets suggesting that a horrific and deadly gamble is taking place in Tallahassee. Expect plenty of misleading and context-free reports intended to create the impression that Florida is the most dangerous place in the world.
In fact it is a place that is seeking to protect both public health and liberty--and so far it's achieving much better results on both counts than either the Empire State or the Garden State. The Orlando Sentinel quotes Gov. DeSantis affirming today that "in the state of Florida everybody has a right to work."


New York State Tops 1,000 New Virus Cases for First Time Since Early June
New York state reported 1,005 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, marking the first time the state's daily caseload has risen above 1,000 since early June.
The uptick, in a state that was once the center of the epidemic but has since largely kept virus cases at low levels, comes as local officials continue to move toward reopening. In New York City on Tuesday, public schools serving grades kindergarten through five and kindergarten through eight are set to reopen for in-person learning.
New York City restaurants will be allowed to reopen indoor dining with 25% occupancy on Sept. 30. Mayor Bill de Blasio also said on Friday that the city will make permanent a program that allows restaurants to offer sidewalk and street dining.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said 1% of the tests in the state on Friday were positive. Of the 1,005 cases, 429 were in New York City, according to data from the governor's office.
"It's vital that New Yorkers continue to practice the basic behaviors that drive our ability to fight Covid-19 as we move into the fall and flu season," Mr. Cuomo said.


Former Senate Leaders, Cabinet Secretaries Aim to Shore Up Trust in Vote
A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FORMER CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS and cabinet secretaries will fund an ad campaign defending the legitimacy of U.S. elections and asking voters to be patient as ballots are tallied this fall. The group, led by former Senate Majority Leaders Tom Daschle, a Democrat, and Bill Frist, a Republican, will spend $4 million on their campaign, focused on battleground states including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The group's several dozen members also include former Democratic House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and Bush Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.
The group is stressing that the effort is a nonpartisan public education campaign focused on the importance of counting every vote. "The integrity of our democratic system is at stake," Daschle said. It will also seek to remind voters that while the coronavirus crisis is in some ways unprecedented, the U.S. has an uninterrupted streak of administering elections, even during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the Civil War. The U.S. has a "history of holding successful elections during challenging times," Frist said.
President Trump has repeatedly tried to cast doubts on the outcome of the election, which polls show he is losing, and he has suggested without evidence that ballot counting that extends beyond Election Day would indicate wrongdoing.
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are particularly at risk of not being able to determine who won the state for many days or perhaps weeks after Nov. 3, given their laws that election officials may not begin to process, much less count, absentee ballots until the morning of Election Day. Over 2.3 million absentee ballots have been requested in Pennsylvania, and over 1.2 million in Wisconsin.
ALASKA becomes an unlikely election hot spot. Polls show a competitive Senate race between GOP incumbent Dan Sullivan and Al Gross, an orthopedic surgeon who's running as an independent with Democratic Party backing. Gross benefited from a surge in donations to Democratic Senate candidates following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: $3 million in three days. The Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund last week reported a nearly $700,000 expenditure to aid Sullivan. Sullivan's campaign didn't respond to requests for updated fundraising data, but reported over $5 million in cash on hand on July 29.


What Happened to Breonna Taylor? What We Know About the Case and Her Death
A grand jury indicted a former Louisville, Ky., police officer on criminal charges for his actions on the night Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot by police.
The grand jury didn't hand down indictments for two other officers who were involved.
Since the grand jury's decision, civil-rights activists and attorneys for Ms. Taylor's family have pressed for the release of the recordings of the grand jury's proceedings. They hoped recordings would clarify how Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office presented the case to the grand jury, including the evidence it provided and the potential charges it discussed. The recordings were released Oct. 2.
What happened the night Ms. Taylor was killed?
Ms. Taylor was at home with her boyfriend when police, who had secured a no-knock warrant to search her home in connection with a drug case, forced entry into her apartment. In seeking the warrant, police said a drug suspect had been receiving packages at her apartment. Ms. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, thinking the officers were intruders, shot at them. Three officers responded by firing more than 30 bullets, Mr. Cameron said. At least six bullets hit Ms. Taylor, one of them fatally, the attorney general said.
What happened to the police officers?
The grand jury indicted former Det. Brett Hankison on three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into the neighbor's apartment. The former detective has pleaded not guilty.


Supreme Court Opens Term With Case on Partisanship of Judges in Delaware
WASHINGTON—An eight-member Supreme Court opened its annual term Monday with a dispute over Delaware's effort to limit partisanship in judicial appointments, after Chief Justice John Roberts solemnly recalled the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as "a dear friend and treasured colleague."
Since 1897, the Delaware Constitution has contained provisions intended to prevent the governor from stacking the courts with political cronies or ideological twins. Under current law, the five-member state Supreme Court must consist of three justices from "one major political party" and two from "the other major political party." Similar provisions govern appointments to several lower courts.
A federal appeals court in Philadelphia struck down the formula last year after a would-be state judge, who is a political independent, was excluded from consideration and argued that it violated his First Amendment rights of association. Delaware appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, contending that its criteria for selecting judges had established a court system that not only was constitutional but also widely "admired for its objectivity, stability, and degree of consensus."
Justice Clarence Thomas asked how far the state's argument reached.
"Could Delaware, for example, pass a law requiring all judges to be members of one or the other of the major parties?" he said.


Kamala Harris's Record Shows Courtroom-Honed Approach, Complicated Ideology
Sen. Kamala Harris has endorsed some high-profile progressive proposals, such as universal health care known as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal multitrillion-dollar climate policy.
The Democratic vice presidential candidate also has worked with several Republicans in the Senate and when she was California's attorney general, but she isn't known for bipartisan deal making.
Ms. Harris's record will be one of the focal points of Wednesday's debate with Vice President Mike Pence.
Mr. Pence has portrayed her on the campaign trail as an emissary of what he calls the "radical left." President Trump has seized on stances she took during her own presidential run that his supporters oppose, such as banning fracking. In 2019, the nonpartisan site GovTrack.us rated her "most liberal" in the Senate, where she has largely voted with her party.
A review of Ms. Harris's record as a senator since 2017 and as attorney general of California before that, as well as interviews with officials from both parties who have worked with her, show that she also has a pragmatic streak that often favors incremental steps rather than sweeping changes and that she is willing to work across the aisle on individual issues.


Pelosi's Taxpayer Ransom Demand
President Trump decided Tuesday to walk away from talks on another coronavirus spending blowout until after the election, and that's the best decision for the economy and taxpayers. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats refused to accept anything below $2 trillion, and their political ransom demand is what blew up the deal.
Mrs. Pelosi's calculation is pure political cynicism. Either Mr. Trump agreed to her terms, or she'd blame him for the failure and use it as an election issue. She didn't want to risk giving Mr. Trump even half-credit for a relief bill before the election. She knows the media will spin it her way, and if Joe Biden wins in November she'll be able to write an ever bigger spending bill disguised as "stimulus" next year.
You almost have to admire the audacity of her demands. Our sources say the White House's final offer was in the range of $1.6 trillion, but Mrs. Pelosi wouldn't take it. Think about that. A Republican President was willing to spend an amount that was half the federal budget only a few years ago, and Mrs. Pelosi said no. Some spirit of compromise.
Mrs. Pelosi's biggest demand was more than $400 billion for states, cities and tribal lands. This is a bailout for Illinois, New York, California and other Democratic states that refuse to adjust their budgets to post-Covid realities. It's an income redistribution play from Florida and Texas taxpayers to blue-state public-union pensions. She also insisted on at least $500 a week in enhanced jobless benefits, which means millions of Americans would earn more by not returning to work.
Stocks fell on the negotiation news, but that's because Wall Street has become Pavlovian on the issue of so-called stimulus cash. But aside from money for beleaguered industries like airlines, there was very little stimulus at all. Both parties agreed on another $1,000 pre-election payment to millions of voters, but that would have little economic impact beyond a short-term fillip for consumer spending.


Houston Can't Send Unsolicited Mail-In Ballot Applications, Judges Rule
The Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday forbade the state's most populous county from mailing unsolicited applications for mail-in ballots to millions of registered voters ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
Separately, the state's highest court also refused to stop Republican Gov. Greg Abbott from expanding the early voting period, rejecting a legal challenge mounted by the governor's own state party.
The pair of rulings from the all-Republican bench underscored the flurry of electoral conflicts across the nation with less than a month until Election Day, amid a polarizing presidential race and complications from the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a 14-page opinion, the state Supreme Court reversed lower-court rulings and held that the Democratic clerk of Harris County, which includes Houston, lacked the statutory authority to distribute unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to some two million voters.
Harris County clerk Chris Hollins said the planned mailers—which would include information about who is and isn't eligible to vote by mail—fell under his duty to conduct early voting and would serve as a helpful guide. The state sued to block the mailings, alleging that mass mailing would confuse residents about the voting rules, and that Mr. Hollins was overstepping his authority under the Texas Election Code.


New York City's Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Leaders Decry New Lockdowns
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday defended his decision to shut down parts of the state despite growing backlash from leaders and members of New York's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.
Under Mr. Cuomo's order, some neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and suburban counties must close schools and nonessential businesses, and limit religious gatherings to a maximum of 10 people. Many of the targeted areas have a high concentration of ultra-Orthodox Jews who are in the middle of a religious holiday, Sukkot, which is marked by gatherings and intermingling of large families.
Dozens of ultra-Orthodox Jewish people in Borough Park, Brooklyn, protested the new measures Tuesday night, lighting a fire in a commercial street, according to New York Police Department officials and video shared on social media.
One man who was videotaping the protest was punched in the face after an argument with protesters, according to an NYPD spokesman. The man was taken to Maimonides Hospital and later released, the spokesman said.
Elected officials in the neighborhoods said the shutdown unfairly targets ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities.


Sorting Mix-Up Sends Wrong Ballots to Nearly 50,000 Voters in Ohio
A sorting mix-up by a scanner resulted in nearly 50,000 voters getting incorrect mail ballots in one Ohio county, and local election officials said replacement ballots will be sent to those affected.
The affected voters in Franklin County received ballots meant for residents elsewhere in the county and so contained incorrect information for local races, said Aaron Sellers, spokesman for the county Board of Elections, on Friday.
Franklin County is home to the capital of Ohio, a swing state that President Trump won in 2016. The state allows any voter to vote by mail by requesting a ballot.
The glitch attracted criticism from Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the integrity of the balloting process, particularly voting by mail. Mr. Trump tweeted Friday: "Breaking News: 50,000 OHIO VOTERS getting WRONG ABSENTEE BALLOTS. Out of control. A Rigged Election!!!"
The error stemmed from a machine used to place absentee ballots in envelopes, Mr. Sellers said. The county is still determining what happened, he said, though there is no sign of fraud so far.


Bolivia Flirts With the Return of Evo
During Evo Morales's nearly 14 years as president, Bolivia grew into one of the Western Hemisphere's most insidious threats to democracy. Now, a year after his resignation, there is a danger that his Movement Toward Socialism party, known as MAS, could return to power—even though a majority of Bolivians don't support it.
One legitimate worry among Latin America watchers is that if the MAS party, with Evo as its de facto boss, makes its way back into the presidential palace by way of the ballot box on Oct. 18, there won't be another fair election in a very long time.
Mr. Morales has been secretary general of Bolivia's federation of coca growers since 1996. He held that post throughout his tenure as Bolivia's chief executive, and under his leadership the country became a narco state and a player in transnational crime.
Mr. Morales is a protégé of Fidel Castro. As Foreign Minister Karen Longarictold the Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete in January, "the relationship with Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba," which became close Bolivian allies during the Morales presidency, "was aimed at consolidating an ideological current that had a geopolitical project." Iran was another friend of Mr. Morales, a further reason why a MAS victory would be a setback for the region.
Mr. Morales was approaching his term limit when he organized a 2016 referendum on whether he should be allowed to run for a fourth term. Bolivians said no. So in 2017 his hand-picked Supreme Court abolished term limits. Using that decision, he ran again last year.


How the Senate's Rules Might Play Out in the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court Confirmation
The Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee will begin holding confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination Monday. Senate Democrats have conceded that they don't have the tools to stop Republicans from confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett as a justice of the Supreme Court. But they could slow the nomination and impose political costs on Republicans for proceeding.
Here is a sampler of some of the procedural issues at play as the 22-member Senate Judiciary Committee, which has 12 Republican and 10 Democratic members, considers the Barrett nomination.
How are proceedings set to unfold this week?
Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has set aside four days for hearings. Each of the senators will have a chance to make opening statements on Monday, after which Judge Barrett will be introduced, sworn in, and given a chance to deliver her own opening statement. Tuesday and Wednesday are set aside for questions from senators, and on Thursday the committee will hear from an as-yet-unnamed slate of outside panelists. There are provisions for a closed portion of the hearing during which sensitive issues such as those relating to a background check may be discussed.
What rules govern the Judiciary Committee's vote to move toward recommending the Senate approve Judge Barrett for the Supreme Court?
Committee rules setting out how the panel operates include the requirement that at least nine committee members, including at least two from the minority party, be present for transacting business. They also require a majority to be physically in attendance at the time action is taken—in this case, voting on Judge Barrett's nomination. In principle that could provide Democrats with an opportunity to slow the proceedings, but committee rules aren't enforceable, and in the past chairmen have simply tabled a point of order objecting to a rules violation, experts on Senate procedure say.
Yet even though the committee chairman can easily dispense with objections from the minority, Democrats could try to make Mr. Graham look bad by suggesting he is steamrolling the nominee through with little regard for the Senate's norms, a narrative that feeds into the broader Democratic contention that the confirmation process is illegitimate because it is occurring so close to Election Day.


Dr. Fauci Protests Too Much
In the case of Anthony Fauci vs. Donald Trump, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) doctor and the media say the Trump campaign is running an ad that takes Dr. Fauci's words in vain. Readers can decide, so let's go to the videotape.
The 30-second Trump ad released last week says "President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America" and goes on to note "together we rose to meet the challenge, protecting our seniors, getting them life-saving drugs in record time." It then features Dr. Fauci saying "I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more."
The quote was pulled from a Fox News interview in late March when Dr. Fauci was asked if he had ever seen as large a public response by an Administration to such a health threat. He responded: "We've never had a threat like this, and the coordinated response, and there are a number of adjectives to describe this, impressive, I think is one of them. We're talking about all hands on deck."
He went on to detail the White House coronavirus task force's 'round-the-clock phone calls and meetings. "So I can't imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more," he concluded.
Dr. Fauci nonetheless took umbrage at his appearance in the Trump ad. "In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate," he told CNN. "The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials."


What Is the Minimum Wage Really About?
Rep. Donald Norcross ("Biden's Good Case for a $15 Minimum Wage," Letters, Oct. 12) bases his argument for an increase in the minimum wage, in part, on the cost of apartment rent in New Jersey. He has no one to blame but himself. Rents are driven by high taxes (sales, income, real estate, energy, employment, etc.) and restrictions on building new housing imposed by politicians like himself. Cut the taxes and red tape and rents will follow.
George Roeck
Westfield, N.J.
The cost of living varies enormously across the country—ask anyone living in New York or San Francisco. These people likely need far more than $15 an hour to survive with one job. However, people living in many other places can do well enough on a lower minimum wage. The basic economic laws of supply and demand will determine what wages actually are, as evidenced in the three years before the Covid-19 virus decimated the economy. We had full employment, wages were rising rapidly across all levels, especially at the bottom, and the "employees wanted" sections of newspapers across the nation were larger than ever.


Amazon Cancels Shelby Steele
As a documentary, "What Killed Michael Brown?" has everything going for it. Its subject is timely, about the pre-George Floyd killing of Michael Brown by a police officer that set off riots in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.
It's written and narrated by Shelby Steele, the prominent African-American scholar at the Hoover Institution, and directed by his filmmaker son, Eli Steele. Its subject—race relations—is a major fault line in this year's presidential election, one reason the Steeles scheduled their film for release on Oct. 16. Our columnist Jason Rileywrote about the film on Wednesday.
One problem: "What Killed Michael Brown?" doesn't fit the dominant narrative of white police officers killing young black men because of systemic racism. As a result, says the younger Mr. Steele, Amazon rejected it for its streaming service. "We were canceled, plain and simple."
In an email, Amazon informed the Steeles that their film is "not eligible for publishing" because it "doesn't meet Prime Video's content quality expectations." Amazon went on to say it "will not be accepting resubmission of this title and this decision may not be appealed."
On their website—whatkilledmichaelbrown.com—the Steeles offer other options for people looking to watch their documentary. But it's sadly telling about elite political conformity that an intelligent film that gives voice to a variety of people, almost all black, who would otherwise not be heard is somehow deemed unfit for polite company. As Eli Steele puts it, "When Amazon rejected us they also silenced these voices and that is the great sin of a company that professes to be diverse and inclusive."


Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Pichai to Testify on Content Policies
WASHINGTON—The chief executives of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc. will appear before a Senate committee Oct. 28 to face questioning about their policies for moderating content on their internet platforms.
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, will appear before the Senate Commerce Committee via videoconference, the Republican-led committee said Friday.
The hearing will center on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields social-media platforms from liability for user content—but which Republicans say has been used by tech companies to censor conservative opinions.
The companies say they make those decisions without regard to political viewpoints. Democrats, for their part, have encouraged the companies to be more proactive in policing false information on social media.
The Senate Commerce Committee's announcement said the Oct. 28 hearing "will provide an opportunity to discuss the unintended consequences of Section 230's liability shield and how best to preserve the internet as a forum for open discourse."


U.S. Reports Highest Daily Coronavirus Cases Since July
Daily new coronavirus infections in the U.S. surged to their highest level since late July, approaching numbers seen during the outbreak's midsummer peak.
The increase comes after the U.S. government on Friday gave some of the first specific information about how it will handle vaccine distribution, targeting vulnerable populations under long-term care.
The country reported more than 69,000 new cases Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, up from 63,610 a day earlier and the most since July 29. The U.S. has now reported more than 8.05 million cases, with more than 218,000 dead.
World-wide, more than 39 million people have been infected and more than 1.1 million have died, according to Johns Hopkins's data.
The seven-day moving average of daily new cases in the U.S., which helps smooth irregularities in the data, was 53,405 on Thursday, and the 14-day average was 50,137. When the seven-day average is higher than the 14-day average, as it has been in the U.S. since Oct. 5, it suggests cases are rising.


Union Voters at Center of Trump vs. Biden Battle for Pennsylvania
JOHNSTOWN, Pa.—Barry Hixson has one of the tougher jobs in battleground politics: convincing rank-and-file union members across central and western Pennsylvania to flip on President Trump.
"Trump supporters are very, very vocal. The people who have had enough of the show, the drama and the politics aren't as much," said Mr. Hixson, president of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 459 based in Johnstown.
The fight over the union vote in Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states could be key in determining the next president and is challenging Democrats, who for decades relied on labor support only to be shocked by the allure of Mr. Trump's message. In 2016, he earned a national level of backing from union members no Republican had reached since Ronald Reagan, exit polls showed.
Given that Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by only 44,000 votes out of 5.9 million cast and that current polling shows him trailing in the state, he cannot afford many defections. Roughly 12% of the state's workers belong to a union and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a Scranton native, is pushing to regain lost ground.
Mr. Hixson didn't vote for Mr. Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton four years ago. "I ended up staying home out of pure disgust," he said. Now he's working to inform workers on what he sees as the president's failed promises, such as saving the coal industry, and antilabor policies.


Pelosi Gives White House Deadline to Reach Pre-Election Relief Deal
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told the White House it had until Tuesday to reach a deal with Democrats, or legislation to provide additional coronavirus relief to struggling households and businesses couldn't be passed before the election.
"That depends on the administration," Mrs. Pelosi said Sunday on ABC's "This Week," when asked about whether a deal could still be struck. The 48-hour deadline "only relates to if we want to get it done before the election, which we do," she said.
If Tuesday evening passes without reaching an agreement, negotiations could continue, but would be unlikely to produce sweeping relief legislation worth trillions of dollars within the next two weeks, an aide to Mrs. Pelosi said. The election could create new political uncertainties that could make an agreement even harder to reach after Nov. 3.
Republicans and Democrats have been sparring for months about a new deal. Some of the programs passed in the spring—including the federal $600 weekly supplements to workers who lost jobs—have expired.
President Trump recently said he could support even more than the White House's latest $1.88 trillion proposal, though it isn't clear Senate Republicans would get behind it. Mrs. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Saturday night. After the conversation, her spokesman said there were an array of differences that still needed to be worked through.


California Ballot-Harvest Boomerang
Democrats in Sacramento have been rewriting election laws to help their party "ballot harvest." But now Republicans have figured out how to play the same game, and Democratic state leaders are threatening legal action.
In 2016 California Democrats passed a law allowing anybody, including paid campaign operatives and political parties, to collect and return mail-in ballots. Two years later Democrats prohibited "disqualifying a ballot solely because the person returning it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name, relationship to the voter, or signature."
We oppose ballot harvesting because it invites mischief and undermines public confidence in elections. Democrats dismiss these concerns and argue that ballot harvesting increases voter access. Ballot integrity isn't among their priorities.
In 2018 Orange County Registrar Neal Kelley reported campaign volunteers were dropping off hundreds of ballots. Democrats boasted that they used ballot harvesting to flip seven House seats in California that year including four in Orange County. Before this year's March primary, hospitality unions threw a "ballot party" for workers outside of Anaheim hotels.
If they couldn't stop these practices, Republicans decided to join them. They've also learned to harvest ballots more efficiently by setting up drop boxes at shooting ranges, churches, gun shops and GOP offices. The boxes, which are locked and supervised, received permission from the site hosts.


The Senate's Hearings on Amy Coney Barrett
Regarding your editorials "Who's Afraid of Amy Coney Barrett?" (Oct. 14) and "Barrett Should Refuse to Recuse" (Oct. 13): When Judge Barrett said she will interpret the laws as they were written, she laid down a marker. It would do us all a great service if these hearings forced the Democrats to set out clearly and concisely their alternative view of what approach a Supreme Court justice should take.
Neil Gaffney
Chicago
Your editorial states that Democrats "are treating the hearings like a campaign rally." Well, of course they are. Asking Judge Barrett questions about her jurisprudential thinking would be a complete waste of time. Her appointment is a slam dunk. So why not use this priceless airtime to promote Democratic campaign issues and their candidate for president?


New U.S. Coronavirus Cases Increase for Second Straight Day
New coronavirus infections grew at the fastest rate in nearly three months over the past week, with more than 60,000 new cases reported Tuesday and data indicating that the spread has been rising steadily for weeks.
Tuesday's case numbers were up from 58,387 a day before, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That marked the second straight day the number of newly reported cases has increased.
Federal health officials on Wednesday urged Americans to limit the spread of the coronavirus by maintaining physical distance and wearing face coverings.
"Unfortunately, we're seeing a distressing trend here in the United States, with Covid-19 cases increasing in nearly 75% of the country," Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters at its headquarters in Atlanta.
The U.S. has reported more than 8.27 million infections in total, accounting for more than a fifth of the world's nearly 40.8 million cases, since the outbreak began. More than 221,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the U.S., and more than 1.12 million have died globally. The U.S. has had 67.57 deaths per 100,000 people due to the coronavirus through Tuesday, ranking 11th among 168 nations tracked by Johns Hopkins.


Colorado Wildfires Span the Rockies, Forcing Thousands From Their Homes
Thousands of residents evacuated Northern Colorado under plumes of smoke and orange-and-red skies, fleeing two fires burning around the Rocky Mountain National Park that by Friday had capped one of the state's worst-ever fire seasons.
One of the fires spread more than 100,000 acres in a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, burning houses, threatening resort towns and overwhelming firefighters with its speed and destruction. Officials closed the Rocky Mountain National Park, which spans the Continental Divide and is one of the state's crown jewels.
The fires now burning, and the Pine Gulch Fire this summer, rank among the four largest wildfires in Colorado history, fueled by climate change and poor forest management, said fire scientist Mark Finney with the U.S. Forest Service Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana.
The Cameron Peak Fire, burning for more than two months, is the state's largest fire in history, having scorched just under 207,000 acres since Aug. 13. An approaching cold front this weekend is expected to drop snow on some of the burning areas.
Colorado's fire season is supposed to be over by this time of year, said Tina Boehle, of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho: "Usually, snow is starting to fly mid-October. But If the vegetation is available to burn, it will burn."


Justice Barrett Joins the Court
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, as she will now be known, was confirmed by the Senate 52-48 on Monday evening, with a swearing-in shortly thereafter. A few congratulations are in order, as well as some thoughts about the future of the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans held firm against the Democratic demagoguery that portrayed Judge Barrett as a sworn enemy of everyone with pre-existing health conditions. Judge Barrett helped by acing her hearings.
She spoke with conversational depth on the law, likening legal severability to a game of Jenga—pull out one unconstitutional piece and the entire law doesn't have to fall. She was sympathetic toward litigants and said she wept with her adopted daughter after seeing the George Floyd video. She kept a poker face for 29 minutes as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse drew conspiratorial squiggles on a poster board.
Her poise and fluency explain why 51% of Americans, in a Gallup poll last week, said they want to see her ascend to the Supreme Court. By voting yes, Republicans stood by their principles and fulfilled their constitutional role, no matter the electoral implications. Chairman Lindsey Graham left the campaign trail to lead the Judiciary Committee hearings. Senators Cory Gardner and Martha McSally, who might lose on Nov. 3, didn't flinch.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell deserves special credit for helping to reshape the federal courts after decades of liberal dominance. In addition to three associate Justices, the Senate in the last three-and-a-half years has confirmed 53 circuit judges, or about 30% of the appellate total, plus 162 district judges, per Mr. McConnell's office. This legacy will last for a generation or more.


Trump Administration Proposes Eliminating H-1B Visa Lottery
WASHINGTON—The Department of Homeland Security is proposing to effectively replace the H-1B visa lottery, the method for selecting which foreign professionals receive the coveted visas each year, with a selection process that gives priority to the jobs with the highest salaries.
The proposal, which was announced Wednesday and will be opened for a 30-day comment period, was one of the expected remaining pieces of the Trump administration's overhaul of the visa program before the U.S. presidential election.
The proposal is the latest in a series of changes the administration has made to restrict access to the H1-B program.
The administration has long argued that the visa program artificially depresses wages by allowing employers to hire foreign workers at lower salaries. Awarding visas to foreign professionals who would earn the highest salaries in their fields would create upward pressure on the market overall, according to administration officials.
"The current use of random selection to allocate H-1B visas makes it harder for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the H-1B program to truly compete for the world's best and brightest, and hurts American workers by bringing in relatively lower-paid foreign labor at the expense of the American workforce," said Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli.


The Biden Contradiction
The Wall Street Journal hasn't endorsed a presidential candidate since 1928—Hoover—and we aren't about to change this year. But we do try to sum up the risks and promise of the candidates every four years, and we'll start today with the contradictory candidacy of Joe Biden.
The former Vice President is running as a reassuring moderate, a man of good character who can reunite the country and crush Covid-19 after the disruptive Trump Presidency. Yet he also is running on the most left-wing policy program in decades.
Voters have little idea about these policies because Mr. Biden mentions them only in the most vague, general terms. The press barely reports them. Americans may think they're voting for Joe's persona, but they will get the platform of Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
***
In Mr. Biden's sunny telling, he will be the anti-Donald Trump. He won't kick down, won't trash norms and won't alienate allies. He'll work with Republicans to forge bipartisan policies, restraining the passions of his party's left. In that sense he has been the perfect Democratic nominee to appeal to women and suburban Republicans tired of polarized politics. He has run a disciplined campaign on character and Covid that has made the election a referendum on Mr. Trump.
We too would like to believe Mr. Biden could govern in a less divisive way because it would be better for the country. Left to his own instincts, and if he were a decade younger, he might pull it off. Every Republican who negotiated with the White House over a budget compromise in 2011 told us they made progress when Mr. Biden was in the room, only to have Barack Obama take it all back when he joined the talks.


Ditching Jeremy Corbyn
Plenty of politicians have led their parties to electoral defeats, but few then have their party membership challenged. Few deserve this unique dishonor more than Jeremy Corbyn, who was suspended on Thursday by the British Labour Party he formerly led over anti-Semitism on his watch.
Mr. Corbyn was elected to lead the party in 2015, and his tenure revealed the anti-Semitic underside of far-left politics. Mr. Corbyn frequently drew the wrong kind of attention for commenting approvingly of anti-Semitic artwork on social media or, earlier in his career, writing a foreword for a book laden with anti-Jewish stereotypes. His office allegedly suppressed investigations into Labour members accused of anti-Semitism—accusations that increased as Mr. Corbyn's left wing of the party crept into greater leadership roles.
This scandalized British voters, including many Labour members who take pride in their party's history of opposition to racism. It contributed to Labour's historic rout in December's election, and it exposed the party to legal problems.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission, a government body that enforces antidiscrimination laws, on Thursday released a report finding Mr. Corbyn's Labour was "responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination" under a 2010 law. It's debatable whether a government body should insert itself into a political party's management this way—the voters' judgment was more damning—but the commission offers a helpful summary of facts.
Mr. Corbyn responded with a Facebook post saying Labour's anti-Semitism "was dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media." This comment earned him the suspension. While he continues to occupy his seat in Parliament, Labour also has removed its whip, a form of suspension from the legislative party.


Walmart to Put Guns, Ammo Displays Back in U.S. Stores
Walmart Inc . said it would put firearms and ammunition back on the sales floors of its U.S. stores, reversing a decision earlier in the week to remove the displays to prevent potential looting.
"After civil unrest earlier this week resulted in damage to several of our stores, consistent with actions we took over the summer, we asked stores to move firearms and ammunition from the sales floor to a secure location in the back of the store in an abundance of caution," the company said Friday.
"As the current incidents have remained geographically isolated, we have made the decision to begin returning these products to the sales floor today," Walmart said.
The retail giant, which sells firearms in about half of its 4,700 U.S. stores, previously said it was removing the items to prevent any potential theft of firearms amid social unrest. It said customers could purchase guns and ammunition upon request even when they were not on display.
There have been days of violent protests and looting this week in Philadelphia after police fatally shot a Black man holding a knife in the city Monday.


Florida to Vote on $15 Minimum Wage
Many U.S. workers and businesses will be watching Florida closely on Election Day, and not just for its decisive role in selecting a president: A higher minimum wage is also on the ballot.
Floridians vote on a proposal to lift the state's wage floor to $15 by 2026, from the current $8.56 an hour. The measure, if successful, would make Florida the eighth state to adopt an eventual $15-an-hour pay floor, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The increase could arrive as workers and small businesses are still reeling from the coronavirus and its effects on local economies.
While the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 since 2009, most states have set higher levels. Florida's minimum is above neighbors Georgia and Alabama, which follow the federal rate.
Voters in states from Arizona to South Dakota have approved higher minimum wages in recent years, but far fewer states have adopted plans to lift the wage floor to $15, the level endorsed by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Most states that have, including California, New Jersey and Illinois, are governed by Democrats. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is a Republican.
Florida is "a diverse, huge state that's heavily reliant on tourism," said Alexis Davis, a policy analyst with the Florida Policy Institute, a think tank that has recommended a higher minimum wage. "If we can make it work, that would be a signal to the rest of the country," she said.


Two Dead in Quebec City Stabbing Rampage
QUEBEC CITY—Police in Quebec City early Sunday arrested a man on suspicion of killing two people and injuring five others in a stabbing rampage on Halloween near the provincial legislature.
Quebec police said the man, who is in his mid-20s, was taken to a hospital. In a tweet, police said their initial information indicates the motive was personal.
Police had earlier warned residents to remain indoors as they hunted for a man dressed in medieval clothing and armed with a bladed weapon who had left "multiple victims."
Spokesman Etienne Doyon said police were first notified of the stabbings near the National Assembly shortly before 10:30 p.m. Saturday.
The five injured victims were taken to a hospital, and a spokeswoman said their lives don't appear to be in danger. Police have asked any potential witnesses to contact them.


Supreme Court Voices Skepticism of Philadelphia Nondiscrimination Ordinance
WASHINGTON—Supreme Court justices on Wednesday challenged Philadelphia's effort to require a Catholic social-service agency to work with same-sex couples in order to obtain a city contract for placing foster children.
"If we are honest about what's really going on here, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in Philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents," Justice Samuel Alito told the city's attorney. "It's the fact that the city can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage."
Conflicts between LGBT advocates and their religious opponents have been brewing since the court's 2015 decision extending marriage rights to same-sex couples, Obergefell v. Hodges. Now, with the court's conservative wing bolstered by three Trump appointees, the majority appeared ready to give a wide berth for objectors to continue longstanding practices without regard for recently recognized LGBT rights.
Catholic Social Services is among more than two dozen private contractors the city uses to provide various foster-care functions; at issue was the job of recruiting and certifying potential foster parents for orphans and other children who are wards of the state. Catholic Social Services only accepts couples that are married and, under church teachings, doesn't recognize same-sex marriage even if the government does.
When city officials learned in 2018 that the agency wouldn't work with same-sex couples, it stopped referring cases to it and, when the contract came up for renewal, inserted clearer language requiring compliance with the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance, which since 1982 has barred discrimination because of sexual orientation.


Trump Says He Will Keep Fighting as Aides Doubt Path Forward
WASHINGTON—President Trump said Friday he would continue to fight election results that showed him on the cusp of losing to former Vice President Joe Biden. Privately, people familiar with the conversations say, advisers are urging him to prepare for that eventuality.
Mr. Trump's campaign on Friday named David Bossie, one of the president's closest political confidants, to head up its legal team. The addition of Mr. Bossie, who is not a lawyer, comes three days after polls closed and after some lawsuits challenging results had been dismissed while others remained active.
Some advisers have privately said they see little path forward, politically or legally, that would prevent Mr. Trump from becoming the first president to lose reelection since 1992.
Among the president's advisers, finger-pointing over the campaign's legal strategy has intensified in recent days, White House and campaign aides said. Aides have expressed acute frustration over what many see as a slapdash legal effort, complaining that—even though Mr. Trump spent months telegraphing his intent to fight the election outcome in the courts—there wasn't enough planning ahead of Election Day and has been little follow-through on decisions made this week. For days after the election, advisers said they didn't know who was in charge of the strategy.
Judges in Georgia and Michigan rejected campaign lawsuits on Thursday challenging vote counts in those states, and the GOP suffered another defeat Friday in Nevada, where a federal judge declined to change the way ballots are being counted in Clark County. Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to order that Pennsylvania ballots arriving in a three-day window after Election Day be held separate for now, which Justice Samuel Alito ordered Friday night, pending further proceedings. They also have said they would pay for a recount in Wisconsin.


Joe Biden Vows to Unite America as President
President-elect Joe Biden called for an end of "a grim era of demonization in America," as he promised to unite a deeply divided nation mired by a pandemic, racial unrest and an economic recession.
"I pledge to be a president who does not seek to divide, but unify, who doesn't see red states and blue states, but only sees the United States," Mr. Biden said at a drive-in rally in his hometown of Wilmington, Del.
Mr. Biden addressed the nation hours after the Associated Press declared that he had garnered the 270 electoral votes needed to defeat President Trump.
President Trump hasn't conceded the race and said in a statement Saturday that his campaign would continue with legal challenges in several states. Republican leaders were largely silent on Mr. Biden's electoral win, although congratulations poured in from foreign leaders.
The Democratic ticket's victory also makes Sen. Kamala Harris of California the first woman ever elected as vice president. She was the first Black woman and first of Indian descent nominated on a major party's ticket, and would be the highest-ranking woman ever in the presidential line of succession as of the inauguration in January.


New York City Bodyguards Are in Demand
New York City businesses have prepared for potential unrest following the presidential election, boarding up windows and bulking up security. Some private citizens, concerned about rising crime rates and the potential for unrest after the presidential election, are seeking out their own protection.
Pasquale Cosenzo, a 48-year-old computer programmer who works in Midtown Manhattan, has become more anxious about his safety on his daily commute. To help ease his concerns, he recently hired a personal security guard to escort him on the 15-minute walk between Penn Station and his office, or stand with him outside when he needs to hail a cab.
"It's been peace of mind, which is all we're asking for pretty much," said Mr. Cosenzo, who commutes from Lindenhurst on Long Island and splits the security with two of his co-workers.
Patrick McCall, who provides security for Mr. Cosenzo through his private investigation and security firm, McCall Risk Group, said his clients are typically operators of retail and office buildings, as well as some corporate executives and celebrities. As inquiries increased leading up to the election, Mr. McCall said, most were from individuals.
"We've gotten a significant amount of calls in the past week," he said. "Seventy percent of those calls now are from regular, average citizens."


Turkey's President Erdogan Ousts Central Bank Governor Amid Currency Crisis
ISTANBUL—Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the central bank governor as the country is beset by its second currency crisis in two years.
In a decree published in the early hours of Saturday, Mr. Erdogan ended the mandate of Murat Uysal, who had led the institution since the summer of 2019, replacing him with Naci Agbal, a former finance minister.
The reshuffle comes after weeks of a currency selloff that has pushed the Turkish lira more than 30% down against the U.S. dollar this year.
The slump, which echoes the lira's steep drop of 2018, has alarmed economists, who fear it could crystallize into a balance-of-payments crisis that could hammer the $740 billion emerging-market economy.
Opposition politician Ali Babacan said Mr. Erdogan bore full responsibility for the turmoil. "The overnight operation to remove the central bank governor is a reflection of bad governance," Mr. Babacan, a former deputy prime minister who defected from Mr. Erdogan's ruling party and created his own, rival movement in the spring, said in a tweet. "You can't escape your responsibility by putting the blame on the shoulders of a bureaucrat who did nothing else than what you told him."


New York City's Covid-19 Cases Rise at Alarming Rate
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday the rising rate of positive test results for Covid-19 is worrisome, but stopped short of saying the city was in a second wave of infection.
The share of New York City residents who tested positive for the new coronavirus last week reached 2.31%, the highest percentage since June, according to city data. The daily positivity rate was 2.88% on Sunday, the data showed.
The Democratic mayor said the city still has time to drive down the rates through use of masks and social distancing.
"This is a warning sign if ever I've seen one," he said at a news conference.
Hitting a 3% positivity rate on a seven-day average across the city could also trigger more restrictions, such as moving public schools to all-remote instruction and closing some businesses.


Trump Remade His Party and the World
Although the American people voted not to give Donald Trump a second term, history will regard him as a consequential president—if not always for the reasons he intended.
Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he reoriented the federal judiciary, appointing three carefully vetted conservatives to the Supreme Court and 53 appellate-court judges, two shy of Barack Obama's count during two terms. By making aggressive use of executive authority, Mr. Trump demonstrated that many limitations on presidential power are customary norms rather than legal restraints. Future presidents and Congresses will have to decide whether to ratify Mr. Trump's expansive conception of his office or enact new limits.
On the domestic front, Mr. Trump's most enduring legacy may be on the Republican Party. When he announced his candidacy in June 2015, the GOP was a coalition of social conservatives, national defense types and free-marketeers. Mr. Trump made his peace with social conservativism and supply-side economics—tax cuts and deregulation—while altering his party's stance on foreign, trade and fiscal policy.
Mr. Trump endorsed robust military budgets while challenging party orthodoxy on alliances and the use of American power. "America first" represented a shift away from internationalism toward self-interest understood mainly in economic terms. He repudiated what he called "endless wars," especially those initiated by George W. Bush, and turned away from democracy promotion, which Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush emphasized.
Mr. Trump's revisions to party orthodoxy in economic policy were equally far-reaching. From President Eisenhower to Speaker Paul Ryan, Republicans favored balancing the budget, even if some were more talk than action. Mr. Trump barely paid it lip service. In his announcement speech, he promised to "save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts," adding for emphasis: "Have to do it." During his first campaign, he proudly called himself the "king of debt"; later he presided over a trillion-dollar annual deficit even before the Covid-19 pandemic.


Recreational Pot Industry Preps for New Jersey Debut
Big marijuana companies and emerging entrepreneurs are laying the groundwork to set up shop in New Jersey after voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing the recreational use of cannabis.
Residents supported the ballot measure in the Nov. 3 election by a 2-to-1 margin. State lawmakers are now crafting enabling legislation to help set up the parameters of the marketplace, and a new state commission is set to start creating regulations for the new industry.
Developing the regulations will take time, and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has said it would probably take about a year before the first wave of retail sales begins. The state hasn't determined how many licenses for growers and retail sites will be allowed. Still, established marijuana businesses and those looking to break into the industry are preparing now.
Charles Gormally, co-chairman of the cannabis-law practice at Brach Eichler, said his law firm was fielding calls from people with an array of backgrounds seeking to get into the cannabis business.
"You've got farmers who own their land, you got distressed warehouse folks, you've got brownfield developers," Mr. Gormally said. "Those folks have control over real estate, and that is their ticket into the marketplace."


Trump Lawyers Pressured to End Role in Election Challenges
Some law firms representing President Trump's legal push to remain in the White House are withdrawing from cases or clarifying their roles amid pressure to end their involvement.
Ohio-based law firm Porter Wright Morris & Arthur LLP withdrew Thursday from a Trump campaign federal lawsuit seeking to stop certification of election results in Pennsylvania. International law firm Jones Day has tried in recent days to publicly distance itself from any voter-fraud suits tied to the president. Another large firm withdrew from an Arizona case a day after filing it, and other lawyers working on Trump cases have faced onslaughts of online criticism.
The Associated Press has said President-elect Joe Biden is the winner of the election after it called enough states to give him a majority in the Electoral College. Mr. Trump hasn't conceded and has told aides to keep fighting.
The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in five battleground states, with a mix of local and national lawyers on their side. Judges have ruled against some of the claims, and Trump lawyers have voluntarily dismissed others.
The Lincoln Project, a political-action committee run by Republicans critical of the president, launched a social-media campaign attacking Jones Day and Porter Wright. Twitter temporarily blocked the group because it posted contact information for Porter Wright attorneys and urged followers to "make them famous." The account was restored once the tweet was deleted.


Let the Transition Proceed
The more divisive our politics, the more important it is to respect the fundamentals of constitutional democracy. Two tenets are critical: elections in which legal votes are counted honestly and the peaceful transition of power. It is appropriate to pose legal challenges to an election's integrity, but not to impede the transition.
Two weeks after Election Day, President Trump's team hasn't presented compelling evidence against Joe Biden's victory. They are assembling that evidence and Mr. Trump says he sees a path to victory, but there is no reason to delay the procedures for transferring power to a potential Biden administration.
The main reason to facilitate the transition is to show that amid deep political division, we can rely on constitutional norms, procedures and institutions. The Trump campaign has every right to litigate evidence of fraud, malfeasance or error. We should care about that evidence, even if it doesn't change the outcome, because it undermines the honest elections on which democracy depends. Anyone who corrupts them should face serious prison time. It's far more serious than bribing your kid's way into college.
Mr. Trump and his supporters have every reason to ridicule the Democrats' hypocrisy about the peaceful transition of power. The Obama administration lied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, spied on Mr. Trump's candidacy and transition, and desperately tried to cover its tracks. The Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign commissioned the false Steele dossier and funneled it into a receptive Federal Bureau of Investigation, launching a series of investigations that hobbled the Trump presidency. Barack Obama's administration launched a baseless crusade against Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Flynn, for making a perfectly legitimate phone call to Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Holdover officials from the Obama administration did all they could to impede the new administration, including leaks of classified information about its actions.
It is an outrage that, four years later, we haven't had a full accounting of this malfeasance. This delay is all the more noxious because the party that engineered these abuses is now returning to power. It is reasonable to fear that if Democrats retake control of the Justice Department, they will be less than zealous in pursuing these crimes.


Violence Led to Arrests, Injuries in Wake of Pro-Trump Demonstrations
WASHINGTON—At least 21 people were arrested and numerous people injured, including one individual who was stabbed, authorities said, as left- and right-wing activists clashed this weekend in Washington over the results of the U.S. election.
The violence grew out of a largely peaceful rally and march on Saturday consisted of a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 supporters of President Trump who traveled from around the country to support the notion that the election has been "stolen" from Mr. Trump, who hasn't conceded to President-elect Joe Biden. No evidence of significant voter fraud has surfaced and administration officials have said the presidential contest was secure.
The demonstration attracted an array of the president's supporters, including mainstream Trump voters, far-right groups and conspiracy theorists such as backers of QAnon, the right-wing group that believes Satan-worshipping pedophiles in the so-called "deep state" seek to undermine President Trump.
Groups of counterprotesters also gathered, though their numbers initially were small during the daytime march, and local law enforcement closed streets to try to keep anti- and pro-Trump demonstrators separated, forming police lines between the two sides to minimize clashes.
By evening, more anti-Trump protesters appeared at various spots around the city, along with some believed to be associated with antifa, a loose-knit network of far-left activists that has used violence to confront people they view as authoritarian or racist.


Philadelphia Puts an Ideology Ahead of Kids
Philadelphia's banning of Catholic Social Services' foster care and adoption services isn't antireligious cruelty, it is antichild cruelty ("Philadelphia's Antireligious Cruelty" by Thomas Paul, Houses of Worship, Nov. 6). The longstanding legal standard for foster-care placement and adoption has always been "the best interests of the child." Philadelphia and other jurisdictions have turned this legal standard on its head to promote other values. The only criteria for the placement of children should be a stable home in which the child has the best chance of thriving. As Mr. Paul rightly points out, there are plenty of agencies willing to place children in alternative-lifestyle homes.
If Catholic Social Services provides good, stable homes for children in which they can thrive, that should be the only criterion. If same-sex couples can fulfill this responsibility as well as heterosexual couples, that doesn't mandate that any given child be placed with such a couple or a same-sex-oriented individual. They may be candidates to serve as foster parents, but no one has a legal right to have a child placed in his, her or their home. Children shouldn't be used as pawns toward serving subordinate objectives.
Society has taken a step forward in attempting to eradicate discrimination against and the persecution of individuals with a same-sex orientation by protecting their legal rights and affirming their human dignity. Philadelphia has taken two steps backward by confusing that goal with acting in the best interests of children.

Giuliani Claims in Court That Pennsylvania Election Was Stolen
Rudy Giuliani appeared in court for the first time on behalf of the Trump campaign Tuesday, claiming that the presidential election had been marred by voter fraud, particularly because of the prevalence of mail-in ballots.
Mr. Giuliani appeared in federal court in Pennsylvania on short notice after joining the case earlier in the day and taking over the campaign's legal strategy last week. He said the alleged fraud in Pennsylvania was the result of voting accommodations stemming from the pandemic, which favored President-elect Joe Biden in several counties that are heavily Democratic.
"This is one of those situations where you never let a crisis go to waste," he told U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann on Tuesday, claiming that Democrats used the pandemic as an opportunity to create a wide scale mail-in ballot process and engage in fraud.
No evidence of widespread fraud has emerged in the election, and Pennsylvania officials have defended the election as fair. On Tuesday, they asked Judge Brann to throw out the case.
"There is no claim any qualified Pennsylvania voter cast more than one ballot," said Daniel Donovan, a lawyer for Kathy Boockvar, the state's top election official. "There is nothing unequal about the ability to cast a vote in this case."


Lockdowns Have a Bright Side for Teens
Here's a silver lining in the Covid-19 pandemic: Teens are talking more with their parents and showing signs of improved mental health, according to a survey from the Institute for Family Studies (where I am a contributing editor).
The study, released in October, found that 56% of 1,523 U.S. high school students surveyed between May and July reported talking to their parents more during quarantine than before. Fifty-four percent said their families have dinner together more often, 46% reported spending more time with siblings, and 68% said their families had become closer during the pandemic.
More surprisingly, the share of teens reporting depression dropped from 27% in 2018 to 17% in the spring of 2020, when remote school was in session, though it edged up to 20% over the summer. What accounts for this counterintuitive result? The IFS study cites two reasons: increased time with family and more sleep.
Time with families buffers kids from depression. They may be sad or in distress, but parents are there to comfort them and help them regulate their emotions and handle conflict. This doesn't mean coddling, but helping them learn to cope with intense feelings. Parents' physical and emotional presence promotes emotional security, the foundation of resilience.
More sleep is equally important. During puberty, a natural change in circadian rhythms called "sleep phase delay" makes teens feel tired later at night than they are used to. That often means a later bedtime without a shift in early-morning school routines, which can result in sleep deprivation. School start times have moved earlier over the years to accommodate working parents at the expense of critical sleep for adolescents. But during the pandemic, without a commute, many teens are finding that they are able to follow their natural sleeping patterns. Poor sleep has been significantly linked to teen depression in previous research.


New York's School Closure Sends Parents Scurrying for Backup
New York City's decision to switch back to fully remote learning in its public schools sent parents scrambling for backup.
Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered schools to temporarily end in-person instruction beginning Thursday due to rising coronavirus cases in the city. Companies that provide learning pods and tutoring services say they have had an increase in inquiries from parents looking for some kind of in-person or individualized instruction.
Hundreds of thousands of students were attending in-person classes this fall, according to the most recent data available, with another 541,000 students opting for fully remote learning. About one million students were enrolled in New York City public schools last year.
Staten Island resident Steve Stanulis said he is rushing to find child care or a pod-style setup for his three children in grade school. Learning pods, which can be organized by parents or private companies, offer in-person instruction to a small group of children who are taught by either a parent or professional teacher or tutor.
Mr. Stanulis, a film and television director, and his wife, a dental hygienist, had rearranged their schedules so they could work on the days that their children attended school in person. But that all changed with Wednesday's announcement.


Trump's Legal Path to Challenge Election Is Closing
A federal judge's rebuke of the Trump campaign's challenge to Pennsylvania's election results gutted one of its few remaining legal cases and underscored what election-law experts have said for weeks: There is virtually no chance the courts will block President-elect Joe Biden's path to the White House.
President Trump and his allies have now lost dozens of rulings in several states, upending their initial strategy of filing an array of cases in hopes that a trial judge would stop a state from certifying election results. They have said their aim was to build momentum and establish a foundation for the claims of election irregularities and outright fraud, which have been offered with little or no evidence.
"They can keep trying, but every day that Biden continues in his role as president-elect, the lack of momentum anywhere else makes these longshot lawsuits even less likely to succeed," said University of California, Irvine law professor Richard Hasen.
U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann's decision on Saturday, Mr. Hasen said, was "another nail in the coffin" for the campaign's legal efforts.
Judge Brann's opinion demonstrated how difficult it will be for the Trump campaign to challenge the election results with arguments that could nullify millions of votes.


Noonan Focuses on the Wrong Bogus Dispute
Peggy Noonan's "A Bogus Dispute Is Doing Real Damage" (Declarations, Nov. 21) has it exactly backward. Coming off four years of consistent cries of illegitimacy regarding a duly elected president, accompanied by overwhelmingly negative mainstream media "coverage" and the baseless and degrading Brett Kavanaugh and presidential impeachment hearings, it's President Trump's staff and supporters who are now undermining democracy?
Bogus? While many scenarios over the past four years aptly fit this description, the recent two weeks of investigation, justifying further pursuit in the judicial arena, is as legitimate as it gets. Ultimately the issue is less about Donald Trump and more about half of the electorate's belief in the integrity and credibility of, and confidence in, a system in which only those votes legally cast get counted. Far from bogus, it is the least that can be done to help establish future-election integrity.

Thousands in Paris Protest Macron's Effort to Restrict Images of Police
PARIS—Tens of thousands of people took to the streets here to decry police brutality and protest legislation that would restrict people from publishing identifiable images of French police officers.
Saturday's protest, which took place as France began a gradual relaxation of a month-long lockdown, is shaping up as a test of civil liberties in an era of coronavirus-linked restrictions. Police had initially banned the protest because of limits on public gatherings, only to have their order struck down Friday by a Paris administrative court.
The protest began in relative calm along a roughly mile-long route, from Place de la Republique to Place de la Bastille. Some protesters held a black banner reading "Police Mutilate, Police Assassinate," while others chanted "everyone detests the police" and called on President Emmanuel Macron to resign.
Later in the afternoon, some people in the protest threw objects toward police and set fires along the sidewalk of a large avenue, sending plumes of black smoke into the clear blue sky. Police dispersed crowds near Bastille with clouds of tear gas.
Some 46,000 people participated in the Paris protest, according to France's Interior Ministry.


Biden Aims to Appoint Liberal Judges After Trump's Conservative Push
WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden in January will begin an effort to recalibrate the federal judiciary with more liberal appointees who embrace a robust judicial role in addressing national problems and protecting an evolving spectrum of individual rights, a shift from the conservative appointees under President Trump.
"Joe Biden thinks the law should be interested in protecting the little person," said Cynthia Hogan, who served as Mr. Biden's counsel when he was vice president and on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Not to determine an outcome, but to say people should not be at a disadvantage because they're working class, they're poor, they're Black, they're women, they're immigrants."
Biden advisers say they will have compiled a list of potential nominees by Inauguration Day—including a short list for the Supreme Court, where the eldest justice, President Clinton appointee Stephen Breyer, is 82 years old.
Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans are determined to leave no vacancies for Mr. Biden to fill. But once he takes office, Clinton and Obama appointees might begin to step down with the assurance that a Democratic president can appoint like-minded successors.
Mr. Biden's ability to appoint judges could be further constrained if Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Senate. The chamber's majority is at stake in two Senate runoff races on Jan. 5 in Georgia. Unless Democrats win both, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), whose top objective has been conservative control of the judiciary, will remain majority leader.


Former Zappos CEO Hsieh's Death Is Ruled Accident
Former Zappos.com Inc. Chief Executive Tony Hsieh died from complications of smoke inhalation, according to the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which ruled the death an accident.
Mr. Hsieh, who led online shoe retailer Zappos.com Inc. for two decades, died Friday at the age of 46. His attorney, Puoy Premsrirut, said Mr. Hsieh died from injuries suffered in a Nov. 18 fire in New London, Conn.
New London Fire Chief Thomas Curcio didn't return calls seeking requests for comment Monday. Chief Curcio previously said the fire was still under investigation. No cause has been released.
First responders in New London rushed to a burning three-story, beachfront home around 3:30 a.m. on Nov. 18, and upon arrival saw dark smoke coming from a storage area at the back of the house, police said in a news release Monday.
People at the scene told first responders that Mr. Hsieh was locked inside the storage area, and emergency personnel then broke down the door and extinguished the fire, police said. The New London police department and fire marshal's office are still investigating.


Five Current and Former MTA Employees Charged with Overtime Fraud
Five current and former New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers have been charged with falsely claiming hundreds of hours of overtime pay.
Federal prosecutors said the five claimed almost physically impossible levels of overtime, often while they were at home or elsewhere, which contributed to each of them earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime in 2018.
Thomas Caputo, an MTA Long Island Rail Road track inspector, from Holbrook, N.Y., received overtime equivalent to working 10 additional hours a day, every day, for 365 days, prosecutors said in a statement accompanying the unsealing of criminal complaints on Thursday.
Mr. Caputo, who is 56 years old, was paid $344,000 in overtime in 2018, taking his salary to $461,000 and making him the highest-paid MTA employee that year. MTA Chairman Patrick Foye's total compensation that year was $347,000.
The other four defendants, three of whom worked for the LIRR and one subway maintenance supervisor, were each paid more than $240,000 in overtime, prosecutors said. Each was charged with one count of federal program fraud Thursday. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years.


Your Boss Can Restrict Your Holiday Plans in the Pandemic
As the holiday season gets under way amid a Covid-19 surge across the country, employers are taking measures to encourage employees to limit their potential virus exposure and to safeguard workplaces. What is your boss is entitled to know about your holiday plans?
The Bottom Line
Employers have wide latitude during a pandemic in what they can ask regarding your holiday plans. That includes asking workers to take a pledge to refrain from any risky behavior—as some companies did right before Thanksgiving—and cautioning employees against any conduct that would violate federal or local health guidelines. It varies by state, but if it is a matter of protecting the safety of the workplace, employers can also discipline workers for what they do during off hours. That could include if workers don't disclose potential exposure to the virus and return to the workplace without quarantining after personal travel or after attending large celebrations.
The Details
Limitations on what employers can restrict in your off-time vary by state, but companies generally have leeway when it comes to protecting workplace safety.
Employers are required under Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to provide a safe workplace, says Jennifer Merrigan Fay, an employment-law partner in Boston at Goodwin Procter LLP. While companies can't unreasonably invade an employee's privacy and make requests such as not to go outside, they can take other unusual, but not illegal, steps during a health crisis aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19.
Companies can, for example, require employees to disclose any travel plans or recent trips, and can enforce recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or local health mandates for post-travel quarantine periods. Some firms also ask or require employees to sign pledges stating they'll keep celebrations small, wear a mask or even limit contact with people outside of their household, she said.


Georgia Sen. Loeffler, Challenger Warnock Spar in Debate With Senate Control at Stake
Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.) repeatedly dodged questions about whether she believes the Nov. 3 election in Georgia was rigged or if she supports President Trump's attacks on her political patron, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, in a Sunday debate for one of two pivotal Senate runoff races.
During a debate period when the candidates could address each other, Ms. Loeffler's Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, asked for a yes or no reply to the question: Did Mr. Trump lose the election?
"You know, President Trump has every right to use every legal recourse available," Ms. Loeffler replied, repeating her response to moderators who had already asked similar questions. "In our own state, we've seen time and again that we have investigations that need to be completed..We need to hold folks accountable involved in these investigations to make sure that they move more quickly because everything is at stake on Jan. 5 for the future of our country."
Officials with the Georgia Secretary of State's Office have said they have about 250 open investigations concerning potential wrongdoing in the 2020 elections but that state investigators haven't found widespread fraud that would overturn the results of the presidential race. President-elect Joe Biden was certified last month by Secretary of State undefinedBrad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Mr. Kemp as the winner of the state's 16 electoral votes.
Mr. Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, also ducked a key question during the debate. He was asked whether he supported adding justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, as some Democratic progressives have advocated, to dilute the influence of Mr. Trump's conservative appointees.


Georgia Again Certifies Biden's Win
Georgia recertified that President-elect Joe Biden won the state Monday after its second recount, ahead of a looming federal deadline for states to resolve any challenges to their electoral votes.
Tuesday's deadline is for states to resolve disputes in the presidential election, and Congress is supposed to abide by those results and reject further challenges. As such, the deadline further restricts the narrowing options for President Trump and his supporters to contest the Nov. 3 election outcome even as they continue to publicly question the results, election officials and legal experts said.
As of Monday afternoon, most states—including more than a dozen swing states—have certified their presidential results, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
In Georgia, Mr. Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes based on the machine recount, according to the Georgia secretary of state's website. State officials have said there was a modest change from the previously certified results, which followed a by-hand recount of votes and showed Mr. Biden ahead by 12,670.
"It's been a long 34 days since the election on Nov. 3. We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged," Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said at the state Capitol.


Trump Bets on Long-Shot Texas Election Lawsuit
President Trump and his supporters have pinned their hopes of reversing President-elect Joe Biden's victory on a lawsuit filed by the Republican Texas attorney general that election-law specialists say has almost no chance of success.
The suit, filed on behalf of the state of Texas, asks the Supreme Court to block Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from casting electoral votes on Dec. 14 for Mr. Biden after he won their popular vote counts in the Nov. 3 election. President Trump himself and at least 17 other Republican-leaning states and 106 GOP members of Congress also filed papers supporting the lawsuit.
Democratic-leaning states—but also Republican-controlled states including Ohio—called on the court to dismiss the suit.
In the filing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses the four states of "rampant lawlessness," claiming they violated their own election laws when officials adjusted voting procedures to process mail-in ballots, which millions of voters employed to comply with public-health guidance to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Texas contends that in making such accommodations, the states violated federal constitutional provisions that direct state legislatures to determine the "manner" of appointing electors.
Mr. Trump called the lawsuit "the big one" in a tweet Wednesday. "The Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States," the president tweeted Thursday.


Alexa Has a New Skill: Asking When It Doesn't Know
Amazon.com Inc. said this week that after years of research its Alexa voice assistant can now figure out the meaning of requests it has never heard before. The upgrade, which the company calls interactive teaching, could represent a significant advance in the way AI-powered voice assistants interpret and learn from everyday conversation, experts say.
Interactive teaching is powered by deep-learning models, and it works by having Alexa ask questions about a task-relevant phrase it is encountering for the first time.
For instance, if a user asks Alexa to set the lights to "reading mode" and the device hasn't heard that phrase before, it will ask what it means. If the user says it means to set the lights at 50% brightness, Alexa will remember that for the next time.
Before this, teaching Alexa new terms required manual steps, such as having engineers program updates, or having users type in verbal triggers for actions in the Alexa app.
But with the new capability, Alexa is able to recognize gaps in its understanding and initiate the learning process, said Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist for Alexa AI at Amazon. The upgrade is available in all U.S. Alexa devices.


Civil Service Shouldn't Mean Unaccountable
I share Susan E. Dudley and Sally Katzen's appreciation for the Office of Management and Budget, which I have the privilege to lead ("Trump Takes a Parting Swipe at the Executive Branch," op-ed, Dec. 10). OMB has one of the most professional workforces in all of government, with unmatched expertise and experience.
But I don't share their overblown concerns about the civil service reforms that President Trump is proposing. Much of the media coverage on the "Schedule F classification" has bordered on the hysterical—claims of "massive government purges" and other easily dismissed boogeymen. Only in D.C. is it this controversial to suggest that federal employees be held accountable for the quality of work they perform.
For decades administrations have failed to achieve meaningful civil service reform. Federal employees themselves complain that it is far too difficult to get rid of poor performers. President Trump has found a way to maintain the institutional knowledge and expertise of career professionals who serve permanently and inject accountability for those closest to setting policy.
Most people in America serve at the will of their employer and learn to "provide objective and informed advice" while being committed to the organization's success. This isn't an unreasonable or outrageous request of federal employees.
OMB's work won't change: Hard questions will be asked, analysis provided and institutional memory maintained. But the men and women of OMB are not a priestly caste set apart; rather, we are the tip of the spear for implementing a president's agenda. And that is why OMB must lead in executing this important reform.


Antibodies as Covid Insurance
The U.S. can buy a Covid insurance policy for next year. The federal government should scale up production of antibody drugs to make as many doses as possible. The Food and Drug Administration has cleared two such drugs, from Regeneron and Eli Lilly , for emergency use. For newly diagnosed patients, they reduce the risk of severe disease.
Making them is relatively straightforward, but supply is limited because the government didn't find enough manufacturing space in the spring. Regeneron and Lilly took extraordinary steps to increase their own production. They knew they had to make these drugs in the U.S., lest other nations try to nationalize production and pocket the medicines. Each company freed up much of its domestic manufacturing capacity by shifting production of other drugs to places like Europe. Each company also joined forces with another large manufacturer to secure additional production capacity— Amgen teamed up with Eli Lilly, and Roche worked with Regeneron. The federal government relaxed certain rules to enable these collaborations. This will produce a combined supply of six million to seven million doses next year.
But that isn't enough. Most biotech companies prepare for disruptions in manufacturing by freezing and stockpiling enough of their most profitable drugs to last about two years. Why not pay these plants to use their capacity for antibody production? Companies can dip into reserves to avoid creating a shortage of other important medicines.
A manufacturer can't flip to making antibodies overnight. It'd take about six months to convert a facility to the Covid drug and another six months to return it to its original purpose. But a big facility that makes the Covid antibodies at full throttle for about eight months could rack up some 2.5 million doses.
The government can help backstop the risks to any manufacturer willing to become a contract manufacturer for the Covid medication. The government can agree to buy the antibody and stockpile it at a price that makes it worthwhile. Regeneron and Lilly would be paid to license their drugs for such an arrangement.


Veterans Groups Call for VA Secretary's Dismissal
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all of the nation's top veterans advocacy groups called for the dismissal of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie after the department's inspector general found he mishandled an investigation into sexual-assault allegations by a female veteran.
On Saturday, Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.), the American Legion and Vietnam Veterans of America joined a number of those calling on Mr. Wilkie to resign.
An inspector general report released Thursday said the secretary disparaged a veteran who said she had been assaulted at a VA hospital last year. Mr. Wilkie and top aides refused to fully cooperate with the probe and a top aide unsuccessfully tried to plant a story with a major newspaper discrediting the woman, investigators said in the report.
Investigators said they didn't find that Mr. Wilkie actively tried to seek negative information about the woman. But they said they couldn't resolve a number of discrepancies because of his and other VA officials' lack of cooperation.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Wilkie said Saturday he will continue to lead the department. He said Thursday that he denied wrongdoing and the investigation was unfounded.


Remember the Persecuted at Christmas
For the first time in their lives, millions of Americans have been ordered by their government not to attend church. For millions of persecuted Christians across the globe, this is the only reality they know.
The theme of persecution lies at the heart of the Christmas story. The Holy Family were forced to flee their native land due to state-sponsored oppression. As citizens of a global superpower whose lawmakers are responsive to their citizens, we are called to stand in solidarity with persecuted Christians. The U.S. government has shown during this difficult year that it is responsive to such advocacy.
The House unanimously passed a resolution in November calling for continued humanitarian assistance to Christians, Yazidis and other communities that survived the ISIS genocide in Iraq and Syria. Also last month, the State Department and the Polish government hosted the third annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, an international forum for governments and civil society.
At the same time, 2020 has presented unprecedented challenges for persecuted Christians world-wide.
In Nigeria, according to Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch, more than 27,000 Christians have died since 2009 at the hands of Fulani militants, Boko Haram and other Islamic militias—exceeding the number of ISIS casualties in Iraq and Syria.


Government Leaders Clash Over Trump's Ban on Chinese Stocks
President Trump's recent executive order prohibiting Americans from investing in companies tied to China's military complex has set up a fight in the highest ranks of government over how broad the list should be.
Since November, the White House barred U.S. investors from buying into 35 Chinese companies the Pentagon has classified as aiding China's defense, intelligence and security apparatus. It sparked selloffs of Chinese stocks and bonds, forced index firms to drop companies from marquee benchmarks, and pushed Wall Street to reassess risks from investing in China.
Now, the U.S. government is at odds over whether the blacklist should include subsidiaries of the companies. Another battlefront is over whether affiliates should be included. The question affects how much teeth the ban will have.
State Department and some Defense Department officials want the executive order to have the widest reach, said people familiar with the matter. They are arguing that excluding subsidiaries or affiliates creates a loophole and ignores the reality of capital markets, some of the people said. Most Chinese companies, especially state-owned firms, tend to list their subsidiaries and affiliates on the stock market, and may issue bonds through these or other units.
Treasury wants the blacklist to only include the companies specifically flagged by the Pentagon, and not affiliates or subsidiaries, the people familiar with the matter said. That is a view generally embraced by many on Wall Street given the fear that a broad list could spook markets and prompt large amounts of forced selling to scrub portfolios of problematic stocks.


Israel Faces Another Election After Parliament Is Dissolved
TEL AVIV—Israel's Parliament was dissolved after the short-lived unity government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to pass a new budget, sending the country to a fourth election in less than two years.
The parties making up Mr. Netanyahu's coalition—which have been squabbling over senior judicial appointments and power-sharing since the government's inception this past spring—failed to agree on a new budget in time for a midnight deadline on Tuesday. The result was the automatic dissolution of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, which triggered fresh national elections that are set to be held on March 23, according to the parliament's speaker.
The new bout of political instability in Israel comes amid the coronavirus pandemic and deep economic turmoil. It presents a fresh challenge for Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing possibly the toughest phase of a storied political career. He is standing trial for corruption, even as he oversees a rapid rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine and works to stem the economic damage the pandemic has wrought on the country.
The collapse brings to an end a government that was established only in May, when Benny Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party, set aside his opposition to joining a Netanyahu government and agreed to form a unity coalition that would guide the country through the twin coronavirus and economic crises.
That agreement came after three elections in the space of a year produced a stalemate, in which Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party won the most votes but fell short of enough parliamentary seats to form a coalition. Polls currently project a similar deadlock.


Rocket Attack on U.S. Embassy in Iraq Largest in a Decade, General Says
WASHINGTON—The barrage of rockets launched at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Sunday was the largest attack on the capital's Green Zone since 2010, numbering 21 missiles, the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East said.
Iraq's president has denounced the rocket firings as a "terrorist act" and said that the targeting of diplomatic missions had tarnished the nation's reputation.
An after-action review by the U.S. Central Command, however, indicated the attack was much larger than the eight rockets than the Iraqis initially reported.
The rocket attack appears to have been countered by the American C-RAM radar-guided defensive systems that the U.S. has deployed to protect the embassy, American officials say, and other rockets missed their mark.
No Americans were hurt in the attack, which damaged two buildings and a gym which troops and embassy personnel use for exercise. It wasn't yet clear if any personnel were inside the gym at the time of the attack, about 8:30 p.m. local time. Several cars parked nearby in the embassy compound were also damaged.


Trump Signs Pandemic-Aid Bill
WASHINGTON—President Trump signed a sweeping pandemic-aid bill on Sunday night ending a standoff with Congress and paving the way for millions of Americans to get economic relief as the coronavirus pandemic surges across the country.
Mr. Trump objected to the legislation last week, after it had already passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, saying that lawmakers needed to increase the size of direct payments to Americans to $2,000, up from $600 per adult and per child for individuals with adjusted gross incomes under $75,000.
He signed the legislation under pressure from lawmakers of both parties. In a statement, the president called on Congress to remove what he called wasteful spending in the bill and said he would send lawmakers a list of provisions he wants eliminated—an effort that Democrats said they will block.
The president also said he expects Congress to vote on separate legislation to increase direct payments to $2,000. The House was already planning to vote on such a bill on Monday. Mr. Trump said the Senate will "start the process" to vote on legislation to increase the direct payments, as well as roll back Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and investigate alleged voter fraud.
"Much more money is coming," Mr. Trump said. "I will never give up my fight for the American people!"


Saudi Women's Rights Activist Sentenced to Prison
A Saudi court sentenced activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who gained prominence for advocating women's rights in the conservative kingdom, to nearly six years in prison on terrorism-related charges—in a case that has garnered intense Western criticism of Riyadh's human rights record.
Ms. Hathloul was picked up in May 2018 just as Saudi Arabia allowed women to drive, something she and other detained activists had long pushed for. She was charged with aiding an enemy country and destabilizing the Saudi regime, as well as speaking with foreign journalists and diplomats, contacting Saudi dissidents living abroad and applying for a job at the United Nations.
The Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, a tribunal set up in 2008 to try al Qaeda suspects, sentenced her Monday to five years and eight months in jail, starting from the date of her arrest, according to her family and people familiar with the case. A reduction for time served means she will likely be released in March on three years' probation, with a five-year travel ban.
Ms. Hathloul, who has been kept largely in solitary confinement and held a two-week hunger strike in November to protest her prison conditions, has appeared physically weak in court, her body shaking and voice faint. She has previously testified to torture by her captors, including electrocution, lashing and sexual harassment, claims the Saudi judiciary has repeatedly denied.
"Loujain cried when she heard the sentence today," her sister Lina al-Hathloul said in a tweet. "After nearly 3 years of arbitrary detention, torture, solitary confinement—they now sentence her and label her a terrorist."


Trump Campaign Asks Supreme Court to Overturn Biden's Wisconsin Win
WASHINGTON—The Trump campaign said Tuesday it was asking the Supreme Court to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in Wisconsin, following a similar appeal it filed last week seeking to reverse the Democrat's win in Pennsylvania.
The campaign asks the justices to declare the Wisconsin election "failed" and allow the Republican-controlled state legislature to appoint presidential electors in place of those pledged to Mr. Biden, who won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes.
But unless the high court grants the campaign's request to expedite the case, the appeal likely will be moot before it comes up for consideration by the justices.
Under Supreme Court rules, the opposing party—in this case, Mr. Biden's campaign—normally has 30 days after petitions are docketed to file a response, after which the justices schedule a discussion to consider whether to hear the appeal.
It is unclear when the appeal will be placed on the docket.


The Vaccine Is Here. Can We End Lockdowns?
In Jay Bhattacharya and Sunetra Gupta's "How to End Lockdowns Next Month" (op-ed, Dec. 18), hope triumphs over fact. In arguing for an end to lockdowns once vulnerable populations have been vaccinated, their analysis assumes that there is a binary outcome from Covid-19 infections: Either it kills you or it's no threat at all.
Follow-up studies, however, have demonstrated that long-term cognitive and behavioral problems are common, affecting up to 20% of hospitalized survivors and up to 10% of patients with a much milder disease. There are a significant number of Covid patients who are left with chronic respiratory problems, chronic anosmia and cardiac sequela, and these problems aren't limited to the elderly. The rest of the population is also at risk and must be protected, even if immediate death isn't likely.
Most Americans would love to see the end of our public-health measures, but this is far too soon. What we can do is return children under 16 to school. We have sound data showing that, given appropriate precautionary measures, we can make school safe for students and their teachers.

What's at Stake in Georgia
What's the difference in policy between a Senate run by Chuck Schumer with 50 Democrats and one run by Mitch McConnell with 51 or 52 Republicans? That's the question that matters for the next two years, so it's worth explaining the stakes with realistic specificity in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoffs.
Start with control of committees, which would shift markedly leftward. Republicans would lose their ability to investigate issues like FBI abuse and Hunter Biden's China dealings. A GOP Senate is likely to approve most of Mr. Biden's cabinet picks, but Democrats would whisk through even controversial nominees like Neera Tanden at the White House budget office or Xavier Becerra at HHS. There would be no check on judicial nominees.
Democratic chairmen would include Bernie Sanders, who would try to gut the Pentagon at the Budget Committee. Sherrod Brown at Banking and Elizabeth Warren on the financial institutions subcommittee would try to change rules to steer lending and capital to their priorities and punish lending to fossil-fuel companies.
Ron Wyden, who would run the tax-writing Finance Committee, wants to tax gains in capital assets each year even if they aren't sold. The Judiciary Committee would go to Dick Durbin, who after having deposed Dianne Feinstein would target conservative nonprofits and think tanks for political attack.
Congress needs only a simple majority to repeal Trump Administration regulations under the Congressional Review Act. Say goodbye to the new rule speeding environmental reviews on public works. A 50-vote Senate (with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking ties) also guarantees a huge tax increase since current rules allow a simple majority to pass a budget.


Republicans Pour Resources Into Georgia, Trying to Keep Senate Control
ATLANTA—Republicans across the country are pouring an unprecedented amount of money and resources into Georgia to try to hold their Senate majority by winning at least one of two runoff elections on Tuesday.
Four outside groups associated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) alone have invested $138.5 million in the races. The Georgia Battleground Fund, a group supporting both Republican incumbents and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, set fundraising targets for each of the 50 states to pump about $50 million into advertising and the Georgia GOP's voter turnout operation.
Democrats are also investing heavily in the races, as expenditures by the campaigns and outside groups have reached well beyond $500 million, making them among the most expensive Senate races in history.
Historic trends favor Republicans. Since the early 2000s, the Republican Party has dominated Georgia politics and the GOP controls both chambers of the legislature and every elected statewide office. Since 1988, Republicans have also won every statewide runoff in Georgia except one in 1998, mostly because of a drop-off in Democratic turnout.
That reliable pattern was thrown into question in November when President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Trump in Georgia by 12,000 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since 1992.


Vanguard Politics Presents the Same Old Class Barrier
Regarding Scott C. Johnston's "Revolution Consumes New York's Elite Dalton School" (op-ed, Dec. 30): Wokesters will predictably claim that conflicts at the Dalton school are "intersectional," but in this case the intersection has nothing to do with race. Racists, after all, don't need to learn elaborate catechisms to detect outsiders. Skin color works fine. Not so with class. Private schools used to teach Greek, and more recently French, to keep out social interlopers. Today's intricate and ever-changing woke orthodoxy serves much the same function.

Highly Contagious Covid-19 Strain Is in New York State, Gov. Cuomo Says
The highly contagious strain of Covid-19 recently discovered in the United Kingdom has reached New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
State health officials said they detected a case of the strain in a man from upstate Saratoga County. The new variant, which is known to spread 70% faster than earlier versions of the virus, was first detected in the U.S. in a man in Colorado, health officials said last week.
The New York man is associated with N. Fox Jewelers in Saratoga Springs, a business where other people tested positive for the virus, New York state officials said. The officials urged anyone who visited the store since Dec. 18 to be tested.
The identification of the new strain in New York came as Covid-19 hospitalizations and positivity rates continue to climb around the state, mostly in areas north of the Hudson Valley.
Another 170 New Yorkers died on Sunday as a result of Covid-19, and 8,251 people around the state were hospitalized, the Democratic governor said. That is the highest hospitalization figure since May 7, state data show. Calculated on a seven-day average, 71% of the state's available hospital beds are occupied.


Britain Locks Down as New Covid-19 Variant Spreads
LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson began a national lockdown Monday, ordering the British population to stay home until mid-February amid spiraling infection rates caused by a new variant of the coronavirus.
As of Monday evening, schools and nonessential shops shut across England and people were told to only leave their homes if necessary.
The imposition of a third national lockdown came after the government's chief medical officers warned the more-contagious strain was spreading quickly across the country and that some hospitals risked being overwhelmed within three weeks if new restrictions weren't put in place.
There are now more Covid-19 patients in British hospitals than at the height of the pandemic in the spring. Mr. Johnson said that the fight against the virus had reached a critical phase. "It is clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control," he said.
The British government is engaged in a logistics race as it tries to vaccinate its population to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable people. Britain moved more quickly than other European nations to approve and roll out Covid-19 vaccines. So far over a million people have received a Covid-19 vaccine shot in the U.K.


Europe's Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign Off to Slow, Uneven Start
Coronavirus vaccination campaigns are off to a slow start across much of Western Europe, sparking criticism of authorities and demands to pick up the pace as hundreds die and tens of thousands are infected each day.
France has inoculated more than 45,000 people in more than two weeks since European regulators authorized the first coronavirus vaccine, made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE . Belgium launched mass vaccinations on Tuesday, while the Netherlands gave its first inoculations on Wednesday. Vaccinations in Italy stalled over the holidays and have recently started to pick up.
The pace has placed those nations, among the world's hardest hit by Covid-19, well behind the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. The U.S. has vaccinated more than five million people, the U.K. more than one million and Germany around 417,000. Israel has inoculated at least 16% of its population with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
French authorities have said the delay is partly due to the need to have at-risk populations, mainly nursing-home residents, consult a doctor and give their consent several days before the vaccine is distributed. Some governments didn't bring forward their vaccination schedules after the region's pharmaceutical regulator, the European Medicines Agency, accelerated its approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week last month.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Tuesday said he was "gnashing his teeth" during the holidays over the fact that the Netherlands was the last country in Europe to start vaccinating against the coronavirus. Mr. Rutte said authorities were caught by surprise when the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which must be kept in ultracold freezers and injected within days of being thawed, was the first to be approved.


A Coup of Pelosi's Own
We scoured the U.S. Constitution Friday afternoon and it's definitely not there: the provision allowing the Speaker of the House of Representatives to intervene in the military chain of command to protect the world from President Trump.
Mrs. Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues that she spoke Friday morning to Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike." She posted the "Dear colleague" letter on her website to make sure the world got the message. A spokesman for Gen. Milley told reporters the chairman "answered her questions."
The press and left-wing Twitter (we repeat ourselves) love the idea of the Speaker inserting herself into the chain of command as a rebuke to an erratic President. But it's an abuse of her own power, which is limited to leading the legislative branch unless both the President and Vice President are incapacitated or removed from office. In that case she is third in line for the Presidency.
But in the meantime she has no business telling the Joint Chiefs not to follow the President's orders. Gen. Milley hardly needs the lecture, as he has been dealing with Mr. Trump for 15 months and isn't about to indulge an unlawful order, much less an effort to launch nuclear weapons.
Mrs. Pelosi's call to Gen. Milley is itself a violation of the separation of powers by seeking to inject herself into an executive-branch military decision. She can offer advice all she wants, but this call at this time has the sound of an order. It might even be construed by some as its own little coup—conniving with the military to relieve of command the person who remains the elected President.


Capitol Police Officer Dies of Injuries Sustained at Riot
A Capitol Police officer died Thursday night of injuries he suffered while responding to the mob of President Trump's supporters who attacked the Capitol.
The officer, Brian D. Sicknick, was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher during Wednesday's unrest, according to a law-enforcement official. After he was injured, he returned to his division office and collapsed, the Capitol Police said, and was taken to a local hospital. Mr. Sicknick, 42 years old, died of his injuries at 9:30 p.m. Thursday.
The Capitol Police said his death would be investigated by the homicide branch of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol Police and federal investigators. Prosecutors are also exploring the possibility of federal charges in connection with the death.
The youngest of three sons born in South River, N.J., Mr. Sicknick had wanted to be a police officer his entire life, according to a statement from his family. He joined the New Jersey Air National Guard, deploying to Saudi Arabia in 1999 and Kyrgyzstan in 2003, according to the Guard.


Prosecutors Unveil More Criminal Charges Over Flint Water Crisis
Michigan prosecutors announced criminal charges Thursday against nine former state and local officials for their alleged role in the Flint drinking water crisis, a strong rebuke of the administration that oversaw one of the worst drinking water emergencies in the nation's history.
The charges announced included the two misdemeanor charges filed Wednesday against Republican former Gov. Rick Snyder. Other former high-ranking state officials face felony charges that include extortion, obstruction and perjury.
Nick Lyon, former director of the state Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Eden Wells, the state's former chief medical executive, each face nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, among other charges.
In 2019, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, dismissed charges against 15 individuals from the prior administration's investigation and announced a new one. At the time, Ms. Nessel said she thought the previous investigation had been "bungled."
"The Flint water crisis is not some relic of the past," said Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, who is leading the prosecution with Kym Worthy, Wayne County's top prosecutor. "At this very moment, the people of Flint continue to suffer from the categorical failure of public officials at all levels of government who trampled on their trust and evaded accountability for far too long."


Extremists in Capitol Riot Had Histories of Violent Rhetoric and Threats
Shortly after the November election, agents with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation received a tip that a man planned to bring guns to a rally for President Trump at the state Capitol and was possibly psychologically unstable. Agents didn't find evidence of criminal activity, a spokeswoman said, but they alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the man, Cleveland Meredith Jr. It was the second time in less than a year the GBI passed concerns about Mr. Meredith to the FBI, according to the spokeswoman.
Last week, hours after a mob overran the U.S. Capitol, FBI agents arrested Mr. Meredith in his Washington hotel room when they were alerted to a text message he sent threatening to shoot House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the head. They found two firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, including armor-piercing bullets, according to court filings.
Prosecutors said in the court filings that the 52-year-old had a history of mental illness and was dangerous. He is charged with making interstate threats to Mrs. Pelosi and failing to register his firearms in Washington. A lawyer for Mr. Meredith couldn't be reached for comment.
The FBI declined to comment about the alerts the GBI said it gave them about Mr. Meredith and whether it was aware of his travel plans to Washington.
Mr. Meredith was one of numerous extremists and private militia groups that discussed online and in emails their plans to attend or support the Jan. 6 pro-Trump rally in Washington that ended in the riot at the Capitol.


Pro-Trump Discussion Board Faces Possible Shutdown
An influential pro-Trump discussion board active in the buildup to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack faces the prospect of being shut down by its web-hosting company for allegedly fostering white supremacist and violent extremism.
Robert Davis, senior vice president of Epik Inc., told The Wall Street Journal his firm warned TheDonald. Win it might be dropped within days if it fails to better cull what he said are discussions glorifying violence, propagating white supremacy and fomenting extremism.
"They need to recognize the critical role they play as an inspirational place rather than a hotbed of extremism," Mr. Davis said. "Epik has no tolerance for anything that incites hate or violence." If the site didn't fix the problem speedily, he added, "they're gone from Epik and it will be hard for them to get service anywhere."
TheDonald. Win has been identified by law enforcement and analysts as an important online staging platform for the storming of the U.S. Capitol that federal prosecutors are investigating as a seditious act and President-Elect Biden characterized as domestic terrorism. Recent posts on the forum viewed by the Journal have included further calls for violence, including a threat to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about which the FBI was informed, according to people familiar with the matter.
The owner of the domain TheDonald. Win, Jody Williams, said he has been trying for months to purge a surging tide of violent, racist and anti-Semitic postings, an effort he said has triggered multiple daily death threats from censored posters against him and his family. Mr. Williams said a small cluster of the site's most powerful moderators—including one who controls its code—have thwarted his efforts to rein in such content even as it grew over the last 10 months.


Senate GOP Set to Argue Out-of-Office Trump Can't be Convicted in Impeachment
WASHINGTON—The political fate of President Trump, and any ambitions he might have for reclaiming the White House in 2024, could be settled by who wins a debate over whether a president can be convicted through the impeachment process after leaving office—a matter on which the U.S. Constitution is silent.
The House impeached Mr. Trump last Wednesday for "high crimes and misdemeanors" for conduct culminating with a speech exhorting thousands of his followers to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and "fight like hell" against congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.
"Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed..unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts," the impeachment resolution, which won support from 10 Republicans, alleges.
The Senate could take the next steps—trying Mr. Trump and voting on his guilt—as soon as this week. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote by senators present; assuming perfect attendance, 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to find Mr. Trump guilty.
Many Republicans are gravitating toward a technical argument: The Senate lacks jurisdiction to try him after he leaves office, they maintain, because he will be a private citizen. That could allow the Republicans to thread a political needle, voting against Mr. Trump's conviction without having to defend his conduct, people familiar with the discussions say.


Blinken's Ties to Biden Will Make Him a Unique Secretary of State
Antony Blinken has one big advantage if confirmed as secretary of state: a nearly two decadelong relationship with President-elect Joe Biden that will enable him to negotiate with allies and adversaries backed by the full authority of the White House.
Few incoming secretaries of state have assumed the job with the long ties to their president that Mr. Blinken has with Mr. Biden. His close association with Mr. Biden has drawn comparisons to James A. Baker III, the longtime friend and political adviser to President George H.W. Bush before becoming his secretary of state, though Mr. Baker came to the post with experience as Treasury Secretary and White House chief of staff during the Reagan administration.
For Mr. Blinken, however, a high-profile cabinet position will be a new role. He has spent much of his career in the shadow of his powerful mentor and will now be called on to demonstrate his skills as a foreign-policy strategist and the nation's chief diplomat.
In his Tuesday hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Blinken plans to sketch out a vision in which the U.S. has a central role in wrestling with global problems, uses alliances and international institutions to try to expand its leverage and pursues policies that it can argue benefit the American middle class.
That approach is intended to supplant President Trump's "America First" doctrine as an organizing principle for foreign policy while also seeking to draw popular support for the Biden agenda from voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to Mr. Trump's approach.


Joe Biden's Unity Address
Whatever their partisan affiliation, all Americans can take pride in Wednesday's inaugural proceedings for President Joe Biden. The peaceful transfer of power from one party to another is a sign of underlying democratic strength no matter our current political distemper.
The ceremony at the Capitol had an unabashed patriotic feel that is all too rare these days. Traditional anthems and prayerful invocations were the order of the hour. Former Presidents were on hand from both major parties as usual, even if Donald Trump wasn't. No one took a knee when Lady Gaga sang the national anthem.
And it was especially moving, at least to us, to see new Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband walk down the Capitol steps escorting Mike Pence and his wife to their waiting car. Mr. Pence in particular deserved this traditional show of respect after his role on Jan. 6 when he refused to reject the state electoral votes as President Trump demanded. He should be getting more praise than he is for that display of constitutional principle.
These rituals send a message to a diverse country, and to the world, about America's fundamental institutional strength despite a bitter election campaign and the turmoil of recent weeks. In China the transfers of power are from one Communist Party cadre to another, and public political rites are limited to unanimous acclamation. Enemies have often misjudged America's raucous politics for national weakness—to their eventual regret.
Mr. Biden struck many good notes in an Inaugural Address that will be remembered more for its moment following the Capitol riot than for its words. The speech had a personal flavor with touches of his Catholicism, such as quoting St. Augustine and praying for the dead. In this and in other personal manners, the new President is refreshingly unwoke.


Trump's Pardons—Good, Bad and Ugly
On his way out the door Wednesday, President Trump granted a long list of pardons and commutations, and it's a mix of the reasonable, the unseemly and the egregious. Here's looking at you, Steve Bannon.
Of 143 people granted clemency, many are drug offenders. To pick a commutation, Isaac Nelson served more than half of his mandatory 20 years for crimes involving at least five kilograms of cocaine and 50 grams of crack, the White House said. Under the First Step Act, signed in 2018, "he would likely face a 10-year sentence."
Some of the drug crimes are no small matter, since they appear to involve trafficking literally tons of marijuana, plus laundering millions of dollars, which is a business that can turn violent fast. Yet public attitudes toward marijuana have shifted. Determining that a sentence was excessive is a judgment call, which is why a President has broad clemency discretion.
Less admirable is the pardon for Duke Cunningham, the former Congressman who's no longer in prison, but who betrayed his constituents by taking bribes. Ditto on the commutation for Salomon Melgen, a big Democratic donor caught up in the probe of Sen. Robert Menendez. Dr. Melgen was given a 17-year sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million.
Mr. Trump, thankfully, didn't pardonEdward Snowden. But why pardon Mr. Bannon? He was charged with fleecing Trump supporters in a scheme to build a private wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The fund raised $25 million, the indictment says, and donors were told every penny would go to the project.


Biden's Executive Orders Signal Collision Course With GOP
WASHINGTON—President Biden signed an executive order Friday designed to swiftly deliver more relief to low-income families and unemployed workers, capping a series of actions taken in his first three days in office aimed at reversing Trump administration policies and enacting liberal priorities.
The orders, more than two dozen, have focused on such areas as the environment, workers and unions, as well as an increased government role in the economy. They come as the White House seeks to persuade skeptical Republican senators to back its $1.9 trillion coronavirus legislation.
Some GOP lawmakers say the initiatives undermine Mr. Biden's push for bipartisan deal making and national unity, a major theme of his inaugural address. At the same time, while his early policy efforts have been broadly cheered by Democrats, some progressives are urging him to go further, reflecting the president's challenge of balancing pressures from both parties.
Mr. Biden's order Friday directed agencies across the government to take immediate steps to enhance federal benefits, such as expanding food assistance, improving distribution of stimulus checks and clarifying that workers may refuse jobs with unsafe working conditions and still qualify for unemployment benefits.
"This cannot be who we are as a country," the president said as he signed the orders in the White House's State Dining Room. "We cannot—will not—let people go hungry." Touting the coronavirus relief plan he is pressing Congress to approve, he cited what he called a once-in-a-century public-health crisis that has hurt American families and said the coronavirus death toll could rise to more than 600,000.


Owners of Famed East Village Bar Look to Expand Beyond City
Ever since it opened 14 years ago, Death & Co has become one of New York City's most heralded bars, a place that helped usher in the craft cocktail movement with its creative drink offerings and speakeasy-style environment.
Now, Death & Co is setting its sights well beyond its original location in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood.
The bar, which is under the umbrella of hospitality company Gin & Luck, Inc., has already established outposts in Denver and Los Angeles since 2018. Gin & Luck's future plans call for opening Death & Co bars or other newly created bar brands at locations across the country by the end of 2022, said Gin & Luck founder and chief executive officer David Kaplan, who has also been with Death & Co since its inception.
Cities being considered include Boston, Nashville and Miami. Mr. Kaplan said he wouldn't rule out a second Death & Co location in New York, either.


Article of Impeachment Sent to Senate for Second Trump Trial
WASHINGTON—The House sent over the article of impeachment of former President Donald Trump to the Senate Monday evening, officially starting the countdown to a trial expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over Mr. Trump's legacy and his future influence over the party.
The House impeachment managers, who will act as the prosecutors in Mr. Trump's second impeachment trial, walked through the Capitol to deliver the article, which alleges he incited a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
The proceedings leading up to the trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority will be needed to convict Mr. Trump, coincide with a moment of intense internal wrestling within the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers have criticized Mr. Trump's rhetoric and actions and called on the party to change direction, while loyalists to Mr. Trump have sought to keep Republicans in line behind the former president, who is popular with the party's base.
"There is only one question at stake, only one question, that senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience," said Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) on the floor of the Senate. "Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?"
Spokespeople for Mr. Trump didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.


For Unity, Biden Must Respect Trump Voters
Your editorial "Biden's Unity Address" (Jan. 21) gives President Biden the benefit of the doubt regarding his desire to bring red- and blue-state Americans together. Did anyone expect a call for disunity? As to whether skepticism is appropriate, recall that six months ago he declared unity with Sen. Bernie Sanders and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden's supporters issued a 110-page set of mutually agreeable policy plans—or as National Public Radio called it last July, "a blueprint for a progressive presidency." Sen. Sanders gushed that, "On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign." Some of us on the right suspect that policy plans halfway between Sen. Sanders and President Biden have zero unifying appeal to red-staters.
President Biden's record-setting first day of executive orders contributed to a foreboding sense that red-blue unity was possible only if conservatives moved far left. For example, "noncitizens" in the U.S. (primarily people who crossed the U.S. border illegally) will be included in the census count used to apportion congressional representatives. The more noncitizens hosted by a state, the more power that state has in Congress and the more federal funds it is likely to receive. Priorities of the Biden-Sanders unity plan include massive investment in green infrastructure, a new public-health insurance option, Medicare-for-60 (instead of 65), installation of a half-billion solar panels and unionization of jobs in the clean-energy economy. If red-blue unity is centered on Biden-Sanders unity, no thanks. NPR concluded last July that a Biden presidency will arrive "with bold progressive ambitions." Wrapping bold progressivism in red-blue unity garb is unappealing to about half the country.

Columbus Police Chief Ousted After Officers Killed Black Men
The mayor of Columbus, Ohio, ousted the city's police chief Thursday, citing a failure to implement changes at the department and a citywide loss in confidence.
Mayor Andrew Ginther's decision to ask Chief Thomas Quinlan to leave his post comes after law enforcement killed two Black men in Columbus in recent months. The city's police department has also been criticized for using tear gas and chemical irritants on demonstrators this summer who were protesting the police killing of George Floyd.
"Columbus residents have lost faith in him," Mr. Ginther said in a video statement. "He agreed to step back so the city can move forward."
The mayor has pressed Chief Quinlan to change the city's approach to policing following Mr. Floyd's killing on Memorial Day weekend in Minneapolis last year.
Columbus voters in November approved the establishment of a civilian review board for police.


Inauguration: God Present More in Word Than Deed
Really! "God at the Inauguration" (Houses of Worship, Jan. 22) by Tevi Troy and Stuart Halpern is hard to swallow. Of course speech writers should use biblical text for an inauguration speech. Bible teaching and values are at the heart of our foundation. The problem, is President Biden. His extolling the Catholic religion he was born and raised in is blatantly obvious pandering for political optics.
We ordinarily don't know what a congregant really believes. Mr. Biden's abortion policy tells us what's is in his heart. It is antithetical to all religions, especially Catholicism. He's an embarrassment to the pope but he's not fooling religious people.

No Good Vaccine Deed
Johnson & Johnson and Novavax this week reported that their vaccines were effective in clinical trials, and what fortunate timing. The U.S. urgently needs a supply boost. But at this juncture it's also worth noting how former Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui positioned the Biden Administration for a vaccine triumph.
One of Mr. Slaoui's inspired ideas was to diversify the federal government's vaccine bets with six manufacturers when nobody knew which, if any, would work. The vaccine candidates used different technologies—Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech (mRNA), J&J and AstraZeneca (adenovirus), and Novavax and Sanofi -GSK (recombinant protein).
The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines were hobbled by trial delays in the fall. But J&J reported Friday that its vaccine was 66% effective at protecting people from moderate to severe disease in a global trial, and 85% against severe illness. Early trial data from AstraZeneca suggests similar efficacy. Novavax reported Thursday its shot appears to be nearly 90% effective.
The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are about 95% effective, so it's fortuitous that their trial results came first so their shots could inoculate the elderly and others most at highest risk. But even if somewhat less effective, the other vaccines may be good candidates for young people and boost supply this spring.
Operation Warp Speed removed the financial risk for drug makers by financing trials and manufacturing in advance so vaccines could roll out as soon as they are approved. This is the reason some 20 million Americans have already been inoculated. President Biden this week ordered another 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna to be delivered this summer.


Are You Eligible for Unemployment Benefits If You Refuse a Job?
I was laid off in 2020. My employer just called and offered me my old job back, but I'm not comfortable with the Covid-19 protocols that are in place. If I turn down the offer, will I lose my unemployment benefits?
The Bottom Line
You can't refuse a job offer out of general fear and still receive benefits. If you have a legitimate safety concern—for example, you were offered a job at a nursing home where there isn't enough protective equipment for staff—you have some protection under a couple of statutes. But there's still ambiguity in how states interpret the statutes.
That may change soon. President Biden has asked the Labor Department to "consider clarifying" the rules and provide workers "a federally guaranteed right" to refuse a job. Clear guidance from the agency would help states, which administer unemployment benefits, apply the rules fairly and consistently.
The Details


Liz Cheney Censured by Wyoming GOP
RAWLINS, Wyo.—The Wyoming Republican Party voted overwhelmingly to censure Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) for voting to impeach President Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Only eight of the 74-member state GOP's central committee stood to oppose censure on Saturday in a vote that didn't proceed to a formal count. The censure document accused Ms. Cheney of voting to impeach even though the House didn't offer Mr. Trump "formal hearing or due process."
"We need to honor President Trump. All President Trump did was call for a peaceful assembly and protest for a fair and audited election," said Darin Smith, a Cheyenne attorney who lost to Ms. Cheney in a Republican House primary in 2016. "The Republican Party needs to put her on notice."
Ms. Cheney said in a statement after the vote that she remained honored to represent Wyoming and will always fight for the issues that matter most to the state.
"Foremost among these is the defense of our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees. My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution," she added.


Senate Democrats See Short Trump Trial Amid Covid-19 Stimulus Push
WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats said they expect a short impeachment trial starting this week for former President Donald Trump as they also seek to push ahead with the Biden administration's proposed $1.9-trillion economic-relief bill.
The two events, combined with continuing hearings and votes on President Biden's cabinet nominees, presage competing priorities as the new Democratic majority—which is reliant on Vice President Kamala Harris to break tied votes—is still figuring out key details on the trial process and on what provisions to include in the bill.
The House impeached Mr. Trump on one article of inciting the Jan. 6 riot in the Capitol, which Mr. Trump's lawyers have denied, and the trial begins in earnest Tuesday. House impeachment managers haven't yet indicated whether there will be new witnesses in the trial, leaving its scope and duration up in the air, according to lawmakers and aides. Mr. Trump's lawyers turned down a request for the former president to appear.
At the same time, Democrats are debating who should be eligible for $1,400 direct checks and whether they can pass a $15 minimum wage as part of the pandemic-related stimulus package.
"The Senate's going to do all three things next week. We're going to do our constitutional responsibility and hold a trial. It won't last very long. We're going to move forward nominees and we're going to continue to push forward Covid-relief legislation," Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said on Fox News Sunday.


The Political Logic of the Trump Trial
What do Democrats hope to gain from Donald Trump's impeachment trial? A conviction could prevent him from holding federal office again, but it isn't clear they benefit from keeping him off the ballot. They beat him in 2020, and his looming presence could impede a new generation of Republican candidates.
But a trial will galvanize and unify the Democrats. It keeps the hated Mr. Trump in the spotlight and distracts from the central issue dividing Democrats: How progressive will President Biden's agenda be? Even more important, they expect the trial to split the other party. Divide and conquer—pit pro- and anti-Trump Republicans against each other, not only now but for coming elections.
To recapture Congress next year and the White House in 2024, the GOP needs not only to retain Mr. Trump's voters but to add to them. Republicans seen as anti-Trump fear losing contested primaries. In the general election, Trump supporters could lose swing voters. For the Democrats, by contrast, trying Mr. Trump seems a low-cost gesture. The only price, they believe, will be a brief delay in approving Mr. Biden's nominees and momentary distraction from his agenda.
This isn't to deny the bipartisan outrage over the assault on Capitol Hill, or the Democrats' genuine belief (shared by many Republicans) that Mr. Trump's actions after Nov. 3 breached the bounds of constitutional propriety. It is simply to recognize that Democrats and Republicans are political creatures who must make hard-nosed political calculations.
Yet the Democrats may end up paying a higher political price than they anticipate. The trial won't only delay Mr. Biden's program. It will tarnish his image as a "unifier" eager to work across party lines. That identity will be much harder to sustain after Democratic senators vote in lockstep to convict Mr. Trump and push through a mammoth Covid relief bill without any Republican votes.


More Than 1.7 Million Counterfeit N95 Masks Seized in Queens Warehouse
New York City authorities raided a Long Island City warehouse that they said held more than 1.7 million counterfeit N95 masks, marking one of the biggest single seizures of personal protective equipment since the pandemic began.
The Queens County District Attorney's office, which spearheaded the investigation, charged Zhi Zeng, the warehouse manager, with felony trademark counterfeiting on Wednesday. If convicted, the 33-year-old Brooklyn man faces up to 15 years in prison. Other individuals are under investigation.
Authorities said the warehouse was "an elaborate production assembly line" for the counterfeit masks. They also found hundreds of thousands of pieces of other personal protective equipment in the warehouse, including disinfecting wipes, children's masks, and gowns.
"We are living in a horrible pandemic with more than 450,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. This defendant allegedly sold false hope and security and was set to sell more of these counterfeit masks to whomever would pay his price," Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said.
Acting on a tip, law enforcement raided the two-story warehouse in Long Island City earlier this week, and discovered more than 100 shipping pallets "piled high with boxes of 3M-labeled N95 masks," according to the district attorney's office. Mr. Zeng, who pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, was present at the time.


Violence Against Asian-Americans Raises Concern in Bay Area
SAN FRANCISCO—Political leaders in the San Francisco Bay Area are forming task forces and speaking out against anti-Asian violence after a spate of recent incidents that include two assaults against elderly men that were captured on video.
In Oakland, Calif., police on Feb. 5 arrested a man suspected in a string of assaults in that city's Chinatown, including allegedly pushing a 91-year-old man to the ground.
Yahya Muslim, 28, was arraigned on Tuesday and is due to return for a plea hearing on March 2 in Alameda County Superior Court. Brendon Woods, the county public defender whose office is representing the suspect, said Mr. Muslim has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and there is no evidence of bias against Asian-Americans in the case.
The assaults spurred Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley to create a special response unit that she said would include members who speak Cantonese and Mandarin that will aim to build trust and engagement with crime victims.
"Since the onset of Covid-19 we have seen an uptick in crime against Asian Americans," Ms. O'Malley said.


Biden to Join G-7 Leaders in Virtual Meeting to Discuss Pandemic Response
WASHINGTON—President Biden will participate in a virtual meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations on Friday, the White House said, joining a forum for leaders of member countries to discuss plans to defeat the coronavirus pandemic as death counts rise and the global economy remains sluggish.
"President Biden will focus on a global response to the Covid pandemic, including coordination on vaccine production, distribution, and supplies, as well as continued efforts to mobilize and cooperate against the threat of emerging infectious diseases by building country capacity and establishing health security financing," the White House said Sunday.
Friday's meeting will be the first G-7 gathering since April 2020. It will be hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada.
The White House said Mr. Biden would also focus on the global economic recovery "including the importance of all industrialized countries maintaining economic support for the recovery and collective measures to build back better..President Biden will also discuss the need to make investments to strengthen our collective competitiveness and the importance of updating global rules to tackle economic challenges such as those posed by China."
Mr. Biden will also raise concerns about climate change, the White House said. The Feb. 19 virtual meeting comes ahead of a planned G-7 summit in June.


For Better Elections, Copy the Neighbors
Hundreds of bills to reform voting processes have already been introduced in state legislatures this year, but there's plenty that the laboratories of democracy could learn from one another. To that end, it's worth watching a new project of the Republican State Leadership Committee.
The RSLC, which is the umbrella group for GOP state lawmakers and secretaries of state, is launching a commission on election reform. "We want to find the best practices that are used in every state in the union, and make sure those are available for legislative bodies in the 50 states to consider as options," says one of the co-chairs, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. "We have a singular goal, and that is to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat—period."
A call went out for ideas some weeks ago, and state leaders submitted suggested best practices on everything from signature verification to audit procedures to pre-election testing of voting equipment. The new commission's role, Mr. Merrill says, will be to sort through that stack, and more, to "see how we can determine which ones need to be presented to legislative bodies across the nation." The aim, he adds, is for the commission to have something substantive to release within weeks.
The potential here won't be lost on anyone who followed the 2020 election mess. To take one example, voters amid the pandemic adopted mail ballots en masse, but some states don't handle absentee votes until Election Day. Pennsylvania legislators considered allowing preprocessing but disagreed with the Governor on how many days were needed. That's one small reason the Associated Press didn't call Pennsylvania for Joe Biden until four days after Nov. 3. State law also lacks clear rules for signature verification, and counties diverged on whether to count undated ballots.
For states moving toward absentee voting, Mr. Merrill says, the model should be their peers like Colorado that have gone to mail ballots exclusively. "When you talk about mail-in," adds the commission's other co-chair, Michigan state Senator Ruth Johnson, "the devil is in the details, if you want to have that transparency and accountability and integrity. It's not good or bad, necessarily, but the devil is in the details."


Trump Criticizes McConnell, Calling Him a 'Political Hack'
WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump criticized Sen. Mitch McConnell in a lengthy statement following the Senate minority leader's blistering condemnation of Mr. Trump's actions leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by his supporters.
"Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again," Mr. Trump wrote in a statement released by his political action committee. He later added: "The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political 'leaders' like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm."
Mr. McConnell joined all but seven Republicans in voting Saturday to acquit Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial, but followed that with a speech that laid blame on the former president for stirring up a crowd, as the two Republicans and their respective allies engage in a broader fight over Mr. Trump's future role in the party.
"They did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth—because he was angry he'd lost an election," Mr. McConnell said. "Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty."
While Mr. McConnell took the position that it was unconstitutional to put a former president on trial, he added: "We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one."


In Texas, Families Take Risks to Stay Warm
AUSTIN, Texas—The children played in front of four lighted gas burners in East Austin on Tuesday night as their family tried to warm up during days of subfreezing temperatures, no power, and no relief on the horizon.
One-year-old Alex Johnson Jr. toddled, his brother Gabriel Brewster, 3, played with a toy, and their cousin Desiah Fisher, 6, hugged them close, as eight other family members huddled around the light of a single candle. Charlene Brewster, the mother of the boys and a 4-month-old daughter, said she knows how dangerous it is to try to heat an apartment with a gas stove. She had no option but to try it for a little while, she said.
"I know carbon monoxide poisoning, but what else can we do?" said Ms. Brewster, a city of Austin crossing guard. "Is anyone going to help us? I have a baby in here."
It was a level of desperation many others in Texas had reached, days into a power grid shutdown during one of the coldest weeks in a generation. Like others across the state, Ms. Brewster's family lost electricity—and, with it, heat—late Sunday night, before a snowstorm closed most of the city and temperatures plunged to single digits. As of midday Wednesday, officials had no estimate of when power might return.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the power grid in the state, ordered blackouts to prevent damage to the electricity system after frozen power plants and a shortfall of natural gas required to run the plants limited power production.


Biden's Immigration Opportunity
Partisans on both sides during the Trump Presidency used immigration to bludgeon each other, but President Biden has a fresh opening for bipartisan cooperation. Now we'll find out if Democrats want to reform immigration or keep using it as a political cudgel.
Mr. Biden made an opening offer Thursday with a bill by New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and California Rep. Linda Sanchez. The bill is dead on arrival in Congress since it doesn't improve border security and provides more or less blanket legalization to the country's 11 million or so undocumented immigrants. "We must not start with concessions out of the gate. We are not going to start with two million undocumented people instead of 11 million," Mr. Menendez said. "We will never win an argument that we don't have the courage to make."
GOP restrictionists during the Trump Presidency also introduced immigration bills that were essentially political statements. They went nowhere. The lesson for Democrats is they won't win an argument in Congress or the public without making concessions to the other party and immigration realities.
***
Start with the bill's eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and three years for some farm workers and young adults who were brought to the country illegally as children. No matter what restrictionists say, most of these folks will never be deported. Many have been here for decades and contribute significantly to the economy.
The young adults known as Dreamers are particularly sympathetic since they didn't knowingly break immigration laws and live in legal limbo. Barack Obama granted them temporary legal status and work permits. As we've argued, he didn't have the legal authority to do so since the Constitution grants Congress power to regulate immigration. But Congress also has a moral imperative to grant a reprieve after the government invited them to come out of the shadows.


Biden to Hold Meeting With Canada's Justin Trudeau
President Biden will meet virtually with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday, in his first bilateral meeting as president.
The White House said Saturday that the session will be "an opportunity for the two leaders to review joint efforts in areas of mutual interest such as the Covid-19 response, climate change, and the economic ties that bind our countries, as well as the deep people-to-people bonds we share."
In a tweet, Mr. Biden said: "I look forward to renewing the strong friendship between the United States and Canada and working to tackle the shared challenges we face."
Mr. Trudeau said Saturday that Canada and the U.S. "share one of the strongest and deepest friendships between any two countries in the world."
"I look forward to my meeting with President Biden," he said. "We will work together to end the Covid-19 pandemic and support people in both our countries."


Notable & Quotable: The Electoral Map
Michael Baronewriting for the Washington Examiner, Feb. 24:
Eleven of the 20 districts where Republicans suffered the greatest percentage losses [between 2012 and 2020] now have Democratic House members, even though all but one easily elected Republicans for years. Similarly, 11 of the 20 districts where Republicans have made the greatest percentage gains now have Republican congressmen, although only five have a solidly Republican heritage.
The partisan strife of the last decade has failed to produce either [a] Democratic majority [or] the less-frequently-projected MAGA nation. But it has shown both parties capable of adapting to unforeseen challenges. And it has produced the most robust voter turnout in more than a century.


Do Democrats Trust Biden?
Old Democratic friends have been warning President Joe Biden not to inflict his supersized stimulus plan on a growing economy in no need of rescue. Today these old hands from the Obama administration are enjoying vindication. Various reports show a robust recovery bearing no resemblance to the dismal scene described by the president. After Mr. Biden's faulty diagnosis and treatment plan for the economy, now it seems that some members of his party don't even want to trust him with nuclear weapons.
The news of the day is rising prosperity. The Journal's John McCormickreports:
Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods jumped in January, as the U.S. economic recovery gained momentum at the start of the year.
New orders for durable goods—products designed to last at least three years, such as computers and machinery—increased 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted $256.6 billion in January compared with December, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
It was the ninth straight month of gains and the largest percentage increase since July 2020. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1% gain, after an upwardly revised 1.2% increase the previous month.
Also today, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew a little faster than it initially thought in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turns out that the Biden "inheritance" from predecessor Donald Trump was a strong 4.1% annual rate of real economic growth in our 45th president's last full quarter in office.
The news is also getting better for workers. The Journal's Eric Morath reports:
The jobs market appears to be returning to growth, with new applications for unemployment benefits falling to the lowest level since November amid other signs hiring is picking up.
Initial weekly unemployment claims decreased by 111,000 to a seasonally adjusted 730,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was also the biggest drop in new applications for regular state programs since last summer.
In and out of government, just about everyone seems to have noticed that the economy is much stronger than our president understands. At the New York Times Neil Irwin noted this week:


Senators Signal Support for Shalanda Young for Deputy OMB Director
WASHINGTON—Lawmakers of both parties signaled they plan to support President Biden's nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget amid continued uncertainty over whether Mr. Biden's pick to lead the office can win Senate approval.
Shalanda Young, a longtime congressional staffer and Mr. Biden's choice as the budget office's No. 2, has been discussed by some allies of the White House as a candidate to lead the office if Neera Tanden's nomination as OMB director is withdrawn or fails in the Senate.
Ms. Tanden has come under criticism from some lawmakers for her past statements on social media. Because Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has said he would oppose Ms. Tanden, at least one Republican must cross party lines or her nomination won't clear the Senate. The chamber is currently divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties.
GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who met with Ms. Tanden on Monday, has yet to say how she would vote on Ms. Tanden's nomination. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) also haven't taken public positions on her nomination.
Republicans and some Democrats have begun advocating for Ms. Young to lead the office.


Donald Trump's Georgia Rewrite
Former Presidents and Vice Presidents have told us how psychologically difficult the early months of lost political power can be. We can therefore empathize if former President Trump is frustrated these days, and perhaps that explains his attack on us Thursday over his role in the GOP's loss of the Senate.
"The Wall Street Journal editorial page continues, knowingly, to fight for globalist policies such as bad trade deals, open borders, and endless wars that favor other countries and sell out our great American workers, and they fight for RINOS that have so badly hurt the Republican Party," Mr. Trump said in a statement. "That's where they are and that's where they will always be. Fortunately, nobody cares much about The Wall Street Journal editorial anymore."
For someone who says we don't matter, he sure spends a lot of time reading and responding to us. Thanks for the attention.
What really seems to rankle the most famous resident of Mar-a-Lago isn't his caricature of our policy differences. It's that we recognize the reality that Mr. Trump is the main reason Republicans lost two Georgia Senate races in January and thus the Senate majority. Mr. Trump refuses to take responsibility for those defeats, contrary to all evidence.
Mr. Trump's statement blames the Georgia losses on GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. His rap on Mr. Kemp is that he didn't fight hard enough to overturn the President's loss of the state in November, a claim Mr. Trump turned into his main campaign theme before the Georgia Senate elections on Jan. 5.


Senate Democrats Pass $1.9 Trillion Covid-19 Relief Plan
WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats passed President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Saturday by the slimmest of margins, following an intraparty standoff over unemployment benefits.
The Senate approved the package along party lines, 50-49, after deliberating all of Friday and into Saturday morning. The package now heads back to the House, which must approve the Senate-revised legislation before sending it to the White House for Mr. Biden's signature. The House is expected to take up the measure on Tuesday.
The legislation would provide $300 in weekly unemployment benefits through Sept. 6, send $1,400 direct payments to many Americans, direct $350 billion to state and local governments, fund vaccine distribution and expand the child tax credit, among other aid. Congress has passed a string of relief bills since the pandemic began, including a roughly $900 billion package in December, with broad bipartisan support.
With newfound control of the Senate and the White House, Democrats moved forward on this bill without GOP support, ultimately rallying around Mr. Biden's first legislative push after a series of internal disputes.
"This bill will deliver more help to more people than anything the federal government has done in decades," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Saturday. "It is broader, deeper, and more comprehensive in helping working families and lifting people out of poverty than anything Congress has seen or accomplished in a very long time."


Bernie's $15 Wage Goes Down Hard
The Senate's vote-a-rama on a $1.9 trillion bill didn't include many notes of economic sanity. Yet one rang out Friday, after Bernie Sanders pushed to add a $15 minimum wage into a "relief" package that already has a few kitchen sinks. Eight Democrats voted no.
The Senate's parliamentarian ruled last month that a $15 wage mandate could not be included in a budget bill. Mr. Sanders's effort to overrule her failed 42-58. Of the Democrats who voted "no," some no doubt agree with Bernie on the substance and merely didn't want to steamroll Senate precedent.
But you might be surprised. "I have backed a $15 minimum wage on the federal level for years," said Delaware's Tom Carper. "At a time when our economy is still slowly recovering, though, policymakers have a responsibility to be especially mindful of the fragile state of small businesses all across this country." Wow, that almost sounds like what Mr. Sanders might call Republican talking points.
Another no was Maine's Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. He backs the $15 target but worries about tipped workers. "If the minimum-wage provision is in the bill with the elimination of the tip credit, it would make it very hard for me to support it," Mr. King said last month. "A lot of restaurants are just hanging on by the thread."
Montana's Jon Tester looks even more skeptical. "I think the minimum wage needs to come up," he said last month. "But I think we need to extend it out a ways before it hits the $15 figure." He urged caution, "so we don't put our small business in a bad situation." Can you blame him? Montana's median wage in 2019, statewide, was only slightly above that, $17.51.


CDC Says Vaccinated People Can Gather Privately Without Masks
People who are fully vaccinated against the new coronavirus can gather privately in small groups without masks or physical distancing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, relaxing safety guidelines for inoculated individuals under some circumstances.
The CDC said Monday that fully vaccinated people should continue to take precautions in most circumstances to prevent the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19. People who are fully immunized should continue to wear masks and keep their distance from others in public or while visiting unvaccinated people at higher risk for severe cases of Covid-19, the CDC said. The agency, leaving its travel guidance unchanged, said vaccinated people should continue to hold off on long trips.
"Our guidance must balance the risk to people who have been fully vaccinated, the risks to those who have not yet received the vaccine and the impact on the larger community transmission of Covid-19," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a media briefing.
The updated guidance comes as government officials, businesses and individuals try to map a path back toward normalcy, one year after the pandemic first shut down much public life and business as usual across the country.
New cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to Covid-19 have fallen in recent weeks following a winter surge, and the effort to inoculate Americans against the virus is ramping up. But public-health officials say people should remain cautious as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations remain at high levels and more transmissible variants potentially complicate the pandemic's trajectory.


Gov. Cuomo Accused by Fourth Female Aide of Inappropriate Behavior
ALBANY, N.Y.—New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office has received a complaint from another female employee alleging inappropriate behavior and referred it to investigators conducting a review of sexual-harassment accusations against him, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Albany Times-Union first reported the new complaint. The complainant, who wasn't named by the paper and still works in the governor's office, accused Mr. Cuomo of touching her inappropriately late last year at the Executive Mansion in Albany, according to the Times-Union. The person familiar with the matter confirmed that was the allegation in the complaint.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters during a Tuesday conference call that he was unaware of the claim. He said he never touched anybody inappropriately or made any inappropriate advances. Nobody ever told him at the time that his actions made them feel uncomfortable, he said.
The latest accuser is the fourth woman who worked for the governor to accuse him of inappropriate behavior or sexual harassment. State Attorney General Letitia James' office is overseeing an investigation into the allegations. On Monday, she namedJoon Kim, a former federal prosecutor, and employment lawyer Anne Clark to conduct the probe.
The attorney general's office declined to comment on Tuesday.


National Guard to Remain at U.S. Capitol Through May 23
The National Guard will extend its mission at the U.S. Capitol into May, the Defense Department said Tuesday, as congressional officials weigh how to secure the complex going forward.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin approved extending the Guard's presence in Washington through May 23, after the U.S. Capitol Police requested continued support. The Guard's mission previously was slated to end on Friday.
Capitol Police formally requested the Guard extension last week, saying threats against members of Congress during the first two months of this year were up 93% compared with last year.
"The National Guard has played a critical role to the Department's enhanced security posture,'' the Capitol Police said in a statement after the Pentagon's announcement.
As of this week, just under 5,200 Guards troops were deployed in Washington from more than 30 states and territories, defense officials said Monday.


Encryption Isn't Main Data-Security Threat
Regarding David C. Gompert's "Effective Cybersecurity Needs Quantum Communication" (op-ed, March 8): The quantum internet or quantum key distribution (QKD) network wouldn't have prevented the recent SolarWinds hack or any of the other $6 trillion network hacks a year referenced, due to a failure of today's communications encryption.
QKD networks already are commercially available in China, the U.S., South Korea and Europe. They are not extensively used because a facility needs access to a special purpose, optical-fiber network or quantum satellite. Such a cybersecurity solution option offers nothing for a smartphone user or virtually any other digital device used by everyday consumers or office workers.
Realistically, the consumer or everyday business email user has nothing to fear about quantum computers breaking their encrypted communications. There are over four billion email users sending or receiving 300 billion encrypted emails a day. Even with a full-scale quantum computer, my estimate is the best a team of extremely talented cryptographers would be able to decrypt a day would likely be several hundred emails.
So, what should the U.S. government be funding in the quantum-computing area? It should support the understanding of quantum-computing warfare tools capable of launching a cyberattack on our nation's infrastructure, including cellular communications, financial services as well as everyday government services. This would be the equivalent of a nuclear bomb attack, only with quantum-computing weaponization. You must understand cyberattack options to counter cyberattack threats.

Democrats Face Test of Party Unity as They Plan Next Legislative Steps
WASHINGTON—In the first months of President Biden's term, Democrats on Capitol Hill unified around his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, quickly passing through Congress a package that closely resembled Mr. Biden's original plan and notching an early achievement.
But Mr. Biden and Democrats will face a far more complicated set of political and policy decisions as they seek to move forward with Mr. Biden's push for infrastructure and climate legislation.
Without a looming deadline like expiring unemployment aid, which helped to quickly mobilize Democrats on the relief measure, the process for passing another major bill could take months. Lawmakers will need to work out the scope of the package, whether and how to raise taxes to pay for it, how to address procedural limits on the legislation, and whether to tailor it so it receives Republican support.
With an evenly divided Senate and a narrow Democratic majority in the House, Mr. Biden and congressional leaders will need to manage competing demands from progressive and centrist Democrats, along with Republicans, on how to craft the package.
The White House hasn't yet provided a blueprint to Capitol Hill, where Democratic aides and lawmakers are beginning to explore ideas based on previous Democratic plans, according to people familiar with the early efforts.


Derek Chauvin Judge Dismisses Two Seated Jurors
MINNEAPOLIS—The judge in the case of a former police officer accused of killing George Floyd on Wednesday dismissed two seated jurors who said their thinking about the case had been affected by a $27 million settlement reached last week between the city of Minneapolis and the family of Mr. Floyd.
Judge Peter Cahill, who is overseeing the case, held a Zoom interview Wednesday morning with jurors who had been seated before the news of the settlement emerged Friday. The dismissals reduced the number of seated jurors to seven from nine. By the end of the day, two additional jurors were seated, returning the total to nine. Jury selection began on March 9.
Because of the setback in choosing jurors, the judge also said he granted the defense three extra peremptory challenges, bringing its total to 18, and the prosecution one more challenge, bringing its total to 10. The defense had been down to its last three challenges before the judge granted the extra strikes.
The judge warned the jurors he spoke with Wednesday to avoid all news coverage before the trial's opening arguments, which are set to begin March 29. He had earlier told the jury just to avoid coverage of this case. The judge previously has expressed his frustration with the timing of the city's settlement and appeared annoyed about having to dismiss two jurors.
"I wish people would—city officials would stop talking about this case so much," Judge Cahill said Monday when the defense asked for a delay in opening arguments and a reconsideration of its call for a change of venue.


Pure America Plans Helped Inspire Evil Policy Abroad
Unmentioned in Barbara Spindel's review of Elizabeth Catte's "Pure America" (Bookshelf, March 10) is how the slippery slope of acceptance of eugenics and forced sterilization in America transformed into government-sponsored euthanasia abroad.
After Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, he built on America's widespread legal acceptance of forced sterilization to launch his own program. His regime quickly adopted a forced-sterilization program, which in the late 1930s morphed into euthanasia, during which more than 200,000 people deemed mentally and physically unfit to live in their society were systematically murdered. During various Nuremberg trials, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes's quote justifying forced sterilization ("three generations of imbeciles are enough") and American government sterilization programs were used by some Nazis to defend their actions.

How Much Should One's Intentions Matter?
Paul Bloom is close to the truth of the matter when he notes that ignoring intent and imposing the harshest punishment is intended primarily to harm ("When Intentions Don't Matter," Review, March 13). Calling for a "culture of greater kindness" to counter that inclination is exactly what our society needs. But we are currently a society without much kindness, and clearly not in the mood to grant anyone the benefit of a doubt. Condemnation is insufficient; cancellation is the preferred solution.
Intention could have been used as a mitigating factor to the level of punishment in nearly every example cited by Dr. Bloom. Intent isn't always so hard to discern. For example, in the case of the New Yorker journalist exposing himself, or the New York Times reporter's quote, the absence of previous such activity would be a strong indicator of lack of intent to harm. And rather than the ultimate punishment of firing, perhaps a timeout to reflect on the action would have been more appropriate.
All of the current major movements for societal change reflect this all-or-nothing attitude. Whether it's income inequality, racial equity or environmental change, each is engaged in a war that has no room for tolerance. Our elected officials need to lead by example, and the voting public to make this a priority. Perhaps then, with kindness, we will have a better chance at achieving all of those important societal changes.

Bitter Alaska Meeting Complicates Already Shaky U.S.-China Ties
ANCHORAGE, Alaska—High-level talks between the Biden administration and Beijing that veered into acrimony put the U.S.-China rivalry in sharp relief, complicating efforts by the two powers to erect guardrails and keep tensions from spiraling further.
The two-day meetings, which ended Friday, covered an array of issues that over the past year sent U.S.-China relations to their most unsteady point in decades: China's clampdown on Hong Kong, repression of Muslims in Xinjiang and aggressive behavior with its neighbors. The two sides also explored some areas of hoped-for common ground.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters afterward that the governments "are fundamentally at odds" on issues such as Hong Kong and cyberattacks, though interests intersect on Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and climate change.
"We were clear-eyed coming in, we're clear-eyed coming out, and we will go back to Washington to take stock of where we are," national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.
Yang Jiechi, China's senior-most foreign-policy official, also noted "important disagreements" remained, and in remarks to Chinese state media suggested Beijing wouldn't back down. "China will unswervingly defend its national sovereignty, security and development interests. China's development and strengthening is unstoppable," said Mr. Yang.


Migrant Surge at U.S. Border Prompts White House Talks With Mexico, Guatemala
Senior White House officials are visiting Mexico and Guatemala this week in a bid to curtail a surge of migrants at the U.S. southern border that is raising pressure for the Biden administration to take more aggressive measures.
The high-level meetings to discuss migration and development in southern Mexico and Central America come as apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border are on pace to hit highs not seen in 20 years.
"Expectations were created that with President Biden's government there would be a better treatment of migrants," Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said during his daily press conference on Tuesday. "This has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, to want to cross the border thinking that it is easier to do so."
The Biden administration is now leaning more on Mexico's authorities to turn migrants back before they can reach the U.S. border. The government of Mr. López Obrador announced last week restrictions on nonessential travel across its border with Guatemala, a measure it said was to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
But a parade conducted on Friday by hundreds of Mexican immigration agents and National Guard officers near Mexico's southern border showed that the enforcement efforts were focused on stopping migrants from reaching the U.S. before they come close.


Joe Manchin Faces Home State Pressure to Oppose Voting Bill
WASHINGTON—West Virginia election officials are lobbying Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin to oppose his party's voting-rights legislation, again underscoring his pivotal role as the Senate's most prominent centrist.
Mr. Manchin is the only senator on the Democratic side of the chamber who isn't listed as a co-sponsor of the legislation. Last week he told reporters he was still reviewing it. All 49 other Senate Democrats back the bill, which would loosen state voter-identification requirements, expand mail-in voting and mandate online and same-day voter registration as well as early voting, among other steps.
The top West Virginia election official, Republican Mac Warner, is headed to Washington to testify before the Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday about the legislation, and at least one member of Mr. Manchin's staff was on a call with state and county officials Monday. Mr. Manchin's office didn't respond to requests for comment.
The voting-rights fight in the 50-50 Senate again puts the spotlight on Mr. Manchin, whose objections forced changes to unemployment payments in the recent coronavirus aid law. He also has opposed the $15 an hour minimum wage backed by many Democrats, saying a lower number would be better.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the chairwoman of the committee holding the hearing Wednesday, said the bill is crucial. "At a time when the right to vote is under attack and special interests and dark money are drowning out the voices of the American people, we need to take bold action," she said in a statement last week.


Blue-State Voter 'Suppression'
Moves by Republican legislators to reform state election laws are drawing incendiary accusations from Democrats. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams denounced them as "Jim Crow in a suit and tie." Vice President Kamala Harris declared, "It's all voter suppression by any other name." The Democratic Governors Association calls GOP efforts "a direct attack on our democracy." Such cant is unfounded and damaging to the nation's political culture.
In Georgia, Republican legislators are close to passing a bill that expands the state's early-voting period by four days. What a clever GOP suppression technique—provide voters with more opportunities to cast ballots.
The legislation would also require Georgians to vote in their home precinct or risk having their ballot disqualified, and it would forbid outside groups to send duplicate applications for mail-in absentee ballots to voters who've already applied for one. Both are sensible protections.
Democrats are particularly upset with requiring Georgians voting by mail to provide the number from their driver's license, free state-provided ID or other generally accepted identification.
If this is racist, then New Jersey, Virginia and California are suppression hotbeds. New Jersey requires a driver's license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number for online voter registration, while Virginia requires both a photo ID card and your Social Security number. California—hardly a red stronghold—also requires ID to register. Where are the bitter denunciations of these state's racist (Democratic) governors and legislatures?


Georgia Mail-In Election Changes Signed Into Law
ATLANTA—Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law changes to the state's election requirements, including altering how people vote absentee and where people can drop off their ballots.
The bill, passed Thursday by both chambers along party lines, is far less extensive than numerous bills that were initially proposed by GOP legislators, following opposition to those measures from Democrats and some major corporations based in the state.
"The facts are this new law will expand voting access in the Peach State," said Mr. Kemp, a Republican who attacked critics as hyperpartisan.
Democrats and Democratic-leaning groups are expected to challenge the new measures in court. Democratic state Rep. Park Cannon was arrested at the State Capitol on Thursday outside Gov. Kemp's office as she protested that he had signed the bill into the law.
The bill requires absentee voters to request ballots by providing their driver's license number, the last four digits of their Social Security number or a copy of some other accepted form of identification. They also have to provide this information when they mail in their ballots. Currently, people sign an absentee-ballot application and sign the ballot when they mail it in.


Congress Summons Its Speech Regulators
On Thursday the CEOs of Facebook , Google and Twitter sat before the House Energy and Commerce Committee as Democrats thundered that they should censor more political speech, and what was notable was how routine this ritual has become.
The Journal reports this was Mark Zuckerberg's "fourth appearance before Congress since last July, and the third for both Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pichai." The gatekeepers of online expression increasingly resemble government regulators, navigating threats and exhortations from politicians.
The hearing topic was "disinformation," and it followed the same committee's hearing last month targeting conservative media. The term "disinformation" is elastic, covering anything from election and health hoaxes to political expression that Democrats disfavor. Rep. Mike Doyle, the subcommittee chair, said in his opening statement that the sites the CEOs oversee are "havens of hate, harassment, and division," and declared, "we will legislate to stop this."
That sentiment was echoed by Rep. Henry Butterfield, who said social-media platforms are "being used to undermine social justice movements." He said Congress may have to "compel you, perhaps with penalties, to make meaningful changes" to employee composition.
Republicans also laid into the platforms, especially their impact on minors and progressive bias in moderation. But the message from the majority party was clear and unified: Clamp down on more political speech, pronto, or risk the consequences. Rep. Jerry McNerney said the removal of disinformation "isn't happening quickly enough."


Media Free Rein Has Come at a Grave Cost
Judge Laurence Silberman's courageous call for the Supreme Court to revisit the federalization of state defamation laws, and the editorial page's discussion of the issue despite its journalistic self-interest in preserving the "actual malice" barrier to legal accountability, are not only commendable—they are overdue ("Reconsidering Times v. Sullivan," March 23).
In the half-century since New York Times v. Sullivan was decided, increasingly emboldened and corporatized media outlets have exploited the zone of protection granted to them to stoke political and cultural partisanship and divisiveness to near berserk levels, to the point where polling data shows that today's approval of the press is on the same order of popular support that hornet's nests, traffic jams, clogged sewer pipes and Congress enjoy.
But the legal questions involved in restriking the balance between protecting the reputational interests of public figures and the First Amendment values of free speech and free thought in the robust marketplace of ideas shouldn't rest on the slender reed of polls and popularity. Just as Sullivan arose out of the historical needs of investigative reporting, revisiting it must account for the entrenched corporate concentration and political orientation of traditional media, social media, and internet-infrastructure and communication-device companies.
Reforming the "public figure" and "actual malice" doctrines wouldn't necessarily move media outlets and platforms toward a more objective viewpoint—that type of movement isn't the province of any court anyway. But it would certainly discourage members of the press, whether left or right of center, from impugning the reputations of the people they report on based on demonstrably false information.

Biden Says U.S. Adds Vaccine Sites, Warns Against Complacency
President Biden said Monday his administration is adding new vaccine sites, as he and other officials asked Americans to keep taking precautions and the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described a feeling of "impending doom" with Covid-19 cases rising recently.
Mr. Biden said the administration is more than doubling the number of pharmacies in the federal program and opening additional mass vaccination sites. He said 90% of adults would be eligible for vaccination by April 19, and 90% will have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their residence. Several states have been broadening their eligibility requirements for vaccine appointments in recent days.
The president also called on governors and local officials to maintain or reinstate mask mandates and said states should pause their reopening efforts.
Although the U.S. has vaccinated more people than any other country, administration officials said the spread of new variants that are more transmissible, an increase in travel and loosened restrictions in several states could lead to a surge in cases and deaths.
"With vaccines there's hope, which is a very good thing, to state the obvious, but people are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing," Mr. Biden said.


Biden to Push Offshore Wind Projects
WASHINGTON—The Biden administration plans to give wind-power developers access to more of the Atlantic Coast and start a slate of new environmental reviews in an attempt to jump-start the country's offshore wind business.
White House officials said Monday they want to fast-track leasing in federal waters off the New York and New Jersey coasts, a priority for wind-power interests and state officials.
The industry wants to locate wind turbines in the shallow waters south of Long Island and east of New Jersey known as the New York Bight, an area where commercial fishing interests have sued to stop previous leasing, saying it could risk millions of dollars in business for scallopers, in particular.
The administration is also moving the permitting process for a project known as Ocean Wind off the southern coast of New Jersey. White House officials say they are beginning environmental reviews of Ocean Wind, the first of what it hopes are 10 reviews starting this year.
The moves are intended to boost an industry that has had a slow start in the U.S., often stymied by federal permitting. The U.S. currently has just two offshore wind farms—off the coasts of Rhode Island and Virginia—with fewer than 10 turbines in operation.


Bill to Make Marijuana Legal Helps Address Unfair Past, New York City Officials Say
State legislation to legalize marijuana would bring a measure of fairness to communities that have historically borne the brunt of drug enforcement laws, New York City officials said on Monday.
New York is set to become the 15th state in the country to legalize recreational use of marijuana after state lawmakers this weekend reached an agreement on its sale for use by adults starting next year. The state decriminalized use of the drug in 2019.
The bill is expected to be voted on and approved on Tuesday.
"I think this legislation in Albany has achieved a lot of what we hoped to see," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at an unrelated briefing Monday. "What I want to make sure is there's a maximum focus on supporting the communities hardest hit, that bore the brunt of unfair drug laws, that really deserve the opportunity now to gain from this new business."
The bill finalized Saturday night would establish a state Office of Cannabis Management that would issue licenses for growing marijuana as well as its sale for recreational use by retail stores or delivery services. It would legalize the possession of up to three ounces of marijuana and allow New Yorkers to cultivate marijuana for personal use.


How to Bring Peace to the New Middle East
The old Middle East peace process is dead: The Israeli-Palestinian dispute no longer dominates the regional agenda. But the geopolitical changes that precipitated the demise offer the Biden administration an opportunity for a fresh approach to ending the conflict.
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process was once the greatest diplomatic show on earth. From George H.W. Bush's sponsorship of the Madrid Conference through President Trump's "Deal of the Century," every U.S. president in modern history invested time, treasure and political capital in the search for Middle East peace. No diplomatic effort in U.S. history has been as high-profile, sustained or intense. Liberal, conservative, Republican and Democratic presidents all hoped to snare the ultimate diplomatic trophy—and the Nobel Peace Prize that would surely come with it.
President Biden may be off to a more cautious start, but in this regard he is accepting the new normal. Rather than appoint a high-profile special representative to jump-start comprehensive negotiations, Mr. Biden seems content to resume humanitarian and educational aid to the Palestinians and reopen diplomatic contacts. U.S. diplomats will attempt to dissuade Israel from taking steps (like dramatic settlement expansions or annexations on the West Bank) that could foreclose future peace possibilities, while looking to make the status quo less burdensome for Palestinians.
That makes sense. The old peace process developed at a time when the U.S. had no serious rival for world leadership, the Middle East mattered more to the global economy than it does today, and Arab states were more powerful in the region than they are now. Under those circumstances, promoting the peace process was a necessary aspect of America's diplomatic balancing act that helped maintain Washington's alliances with the Arab world while supporting Israel.
Since then, the leading Arab states have either fallen into chaos (Syria and Iraq) or become so worried about Iran that they have little energy to devote to the Palestinian cause. At the same time, Israel's attractiveness as a trading partner and source of technology and investment has dramatically increased. As the Gulf states look to shift away from an unhealthy dependence on oil, business and tech partnerships with Israel are too good to pass up.


Supreme Court Looks at Consequences of Falsely Calling Someone a Terrorist
WASHINGTON—A class-action lawsuit by some 8,000 consumers falsely labeled as potential terrorists on their credit reports appeared likely to survive following Supreme Court arguments Tuesday but several justices suggested not all of the individuals merited compensation.
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, TransUnion LLC launched a product, OFAC Advisor, which it marketed to creditors faced with USA Patriot Act provisions prohibiting transactions with individuals listed by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
"TransUnion OFAC Advisor provides the most comprehensive international list of known terrorists and criminals using the OFAC list as well as expanded information from multiple sources. TransUnion OFAC Advisor is designed to minimize the number of 'false positives' using unique matching logic," a 2002 press release announcing the product said.
In February 2011, Sergio Ramirez discovered he had been identified as a potential terrorist by TransUnion when he tried to buy a Nissan Maxima from a dealer in Dublin, Calif. After settling on the price, the salesman canceled the deal after running Mr. Ramirez's credit; he showed Mr. Ramirez the TransUnion report stating that "input name matches name on the OFAC database."
It wasn't the first such error TransUnion had disseminated; in 2007, another consumer won a six-figure award from the company under similar circumstances. TransUnion, however, didn't substantially change its procedures for checking the OFAC list, according to a federal appeals court, relying on a vendor to do name matches. Altogether the credit reports of 1,800 of the 8,000 consumers who had been identified as potential terrorists were shared with third parties.


Prosecutors Drop Fraud Case Against Former Brixmor Executives
Federal prosecutors took the unusual step of dismissing criminal charges against former executives of shopping-center owner Brixmor Property Group Inc. , telling a judge they couldn't prove their claims of accounting fraud.
The move ends the case against Michael Carroll and Michael Pappagallo, Brixmor's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, respectively. Messrs. Carroll and Pappagallo were indicted in July 2019 on claims they manipulated a key earnings metric, same-property net operating income, in order to meet quarterly targets.
But after doing more investigation, prosecutors decided a building block of their fraud theory might not hold water in court, according to a letter they sent Thursday to U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan. Prosecutors also dismissed cases against two former Brixmor senior accounting officers, Steven Splain and Michael Mortimer, who had earlier agreed to plead guilty.
The outcome is rare and "mildly embarrassing" for the government, said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and expert in white-collar-crime enforcement. "Here they are saying, 'we really don't think we have the evidence, and as true professionals, we don't think we can pursue the prosecution,'" Mr. Coffee said.
Brixmor is a real-estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns about 393 shopping centers with tenants such as TJX Cos., Kroger Co. and Dollar Tree Stores Inc. The company began an internal investigation in 2015 after an employee in its accounting department alleged executives used "cookie-jar" tactics to meet earnings guidance given to Wall Street, according to a 2019 Securities and Exchange Commission order resolving a separate civil-fraud case against Brixmor.


Migrant Arrests at U.S. Southern Border Reach 15-Year High
Border agents arrested more than 170,000 migrants crossing the southern border illegally in March, according to a person familiar with the numbers, marking a 15-year high in monthly border crossings.
The number is up significantly from February, when agents arrested nearly 97,000 migrants at the border, worsening an already fraught logistical and political challenge for the Biden administration as it tries to bring the border under control.
The surge represents a multipronged problem for the government, with single men, families with young children and unaccompanied minors all coming to the border in swelling numbers. The March arrest totals were first reported by the Washington Post.
The administration has continued to enforce a Trump-era public-health policy at the border, known as Title 42, that allows agents to immediately turn back migrants caught crossing the border without formally arresting them, which also denies the migrants a chance to ask for asylum.
The policy has led migrants to attempt multiple border crossings, hoping to evade the Border Patrol and enter the country undetected. Agents arrested about 99,000 single adults in March. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that earlier in March, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, had estimated about 6,500 such single adults evaded Border Patrol detection over one seven-day period.


Taiwan Train Derails, Killing More Than 50 People
TAIPEI—The derailment of a passenger train in Taiwan killed at least 50 people and injured more than 180 others on Friday in the island's deadliest rail incident in at least four decades.
The express train, traveling from the Taipei area and heading southbound through eastern Taiwan to Taitung, was carrying almost 500 people, including railway staff, when it went off the tracks at around 9:30 a.m. in a tunnel near the scenic area of Hualien, causing some carriages to hit the tunnel walls, local authorities said. The train, the Taroko Express, is capable of reaching speeds of about 80 miles an hour.
As of 6 p.m. Saturday, 51 people, including two train conductors, two Americans and a French passenger, had been declared dead in the incident, while 188 injured had been taken to hospitals, according to authorities. By Friday evening, firefighters had rescued all remaining passengers.
"I share sorrow with my fellow countrymen," Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said Friday afternoon. She said the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the incident, and urged the public to refrain from excessive speculation and await the final investigation results.
A preliminary investigation published by Taiwan's Central Emergency Operation Center on Friday indicated that the eight-car train hit a construction vehicle that had stopped on the tracks.


Tennessee Asks Supreme Court to Reinstate 48-Hour Waiting Period for Abortions
WASHINGTON—The state of Tennessee asked the Supreme Court Monday to reinstate a 48-hour waiting period imposed on women seeking abortions, after lower courts found it unconstitutional.
Tennessee asked the high court to reimpose the restriction while it appeals a 136-page opinion from a federal judge in Nashville, who found that the restriction imposed an undue burden on women's right to end pregnancy, the standard the Supreme Court applies under a 1992 precedent known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
"Although fourteen other States have similar waiting-period laws that generally require two trips to an abortion provider, Tennessee is the only State in the Nation that cannot enforce its law because of a federal judicial decree," Tennessee said in its filing.
Last October, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman found the waiting period "burdens the majority of abortion patients with significant, and often insurmountable, logistical and financial hurdles" because it requires two visits to the clinic. Most women in the state who seek abortions are poor, and often must travel significant distances to reach one of the four Tennessee clinics, he found. Taking time off from work, arranging child care and other necessary steps can make obtaining the procedure prohibitive, Judge Friedman found.
Tennessee's filing said that the waiting period had been in effect for some five years before Judge Friedman's ruling, during which time the state abortion rate "declined only slightly" and remained above 10,000 procedures annually.


Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'
Some 125 residents in Marin County, Calif., can expect to begin receiving payments of $1,000 a month starting in May—no strings attached. It's an experiment providing a "universal basic income," or UBI, to low-income Americans.
In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.
The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be "mothers of color." That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.
No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies "strict scrutiny"—the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny—to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based affirmative-action programs.
If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.


New York City Mayoral Candidates Seek Face Time With Voters
As a June 22 primary nears and Covid-19 restrictions ease, New York City mayoral candidates have ratcheted up in-person campaigning to win over undecided voters.
Many of the more than three dozen candidates entered the race in the middle of the pandemic, while the city was under lockdown. The restrictions pushed them to participate in candidate forums on Zoom, host online fundraisers and find creative ways to engage voters they couldn't greet face to face.
But with more than 4.8 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine administered in New York City and the arrival of spring, candidates are coming out from behind their computer screens to meet voters.
Democratic mayoral candidate Dianne Morales announced March 30 that she would no longer participate in any online candidate forums, opting instead to talk to voters where they are: at subway stations, supermarkets and, on Saturday, a dog park at Herbert Von King Park in Brooklyn.
Late last year and at the start of 2021, the mayoral race was dominated by online forums, with candidates sometimes participating in more than one each day.


Chauvin Prosecutors Near End of Case in Floyd's Death
MINNEAPOLIS—Prosecutors called their last witness Monday after 11 days of testimony designed to bolster their argument that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck and back for more than nine minutes.
The widely seen video of the May 25 incident sparked outrage and unrest across the country, depicting Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black security guard, handcuffed and lying on his stomach as Mr. Chauvin knelt on him. Mr. Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Prosecutors are expected to formally rest their case on Tuesday, a spokesman said. Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvin's attorney, will then try to raise reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds, presenting evidence that he has said will show that Mr. Floyd died of a drug overdose and a heart condition.
Judge Peter Cahill said he expected closing arguments would begin on Monday.
In the final day of prosecution testimony, the team led by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison touched on the two main pillars of its case. A cardiologist said Mr. Floyd died of a lack of oxygen, and used the video and medical evidence to rule out other factors, including his drug use or a heart attack. A law professor who studies police use of force testified that Mr. Chauvin faced a limited threat from the handcuffed Mr. Floyd that fell to zero after he stopped breathing even as Mr. Chauvin continued a dangerous type of restraint.


Derek Chauvin Defense Expert Says Restraint of George Floyd Was Reasonable
Derek Chauvin's defense lawyer closed his first day of testimony in the former officer's murder trial over the killing of George Floyd with a policing consultant who said Mr. Chauvin's use of force was reasonable, but later backed away from key parts of his conclusion.
"I felt that Officer Chauvin's interactions with Mr. Floyd were following his training, following current practices and training and were objectively reasonable," said Barry Brodd, a 29-year law-enforcement veteran, trainer and consultant on police practices. He also said Mr. Chauvin wasn't using deadly force.
Prosecutors formally rested their case Tuesday morning against Mr. Chauvin. Mr. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, began presenting his case, arguing that his client didn't kill Mr. Floyd but took reasonable measures to restrain what he described as a distressed criminal suspect with a sickly heart who posed a danger to officers after taking fentanyl.
During prosecutor Steve Schleicher's cross-examination, Mr. Brodd acknowledged that by pressing his knee into Mr. Floyd, Mr. Chauvin "could" produce pain, which would be an unjustified use of force.
Mr. Brodd also acknowledged that Floyd wasn't talking or resisting after a certain point and lost consciousness, but Mr. Chauvin kept his position.


Iran Plans to Enrich Uranium Closer to Weapons Grade
Iran will start enriching some of its stock of uranium to 60% for the first time, one of Iran's leading nuclear negotiators said Tuesday, after an attack on its main nuclear facility.
But the country's negotiators will continue to participate in talks in Vienna on constraining its nuclear activities in return for a reversal of American economic sanctions on Tehran. Former U.S. officials said that Iran's announcement appeared to be calculated to fortify Iran's negotiating hand and counter the notion that its nuclear program had suffered a major setback.
The comments from Abbas Araghchi, a deputy foreign minister, followed the apparent sabotage of Iran's Natanz nuclear facility Sunday, which caused an electrical blackout that destroyed a number of centrifuges. Israeli media reported that the attack was carried out by the nation's Mossad intelligence agency, though Israeli officials declined to comment. Iran has also blamed Israel. The White House has said the U.S. had no involvement in the Natanz attack.
"The Iranians believe their nuclear activity provides leverage in the talks," said Gary Samore, director of the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University and a weapons-of-mass-destruction expert on former President Barack Obama's National Security Council. "Since some portion of Natanz appears to have been knocked out for some period, that weakens their leverage, and they have compensated by announcing higher enrichment levels."
Mr. Araghchi was in the Austrian capital to attend a second week of negotiations over restoring the 2015 nuclear deal by bringing Iran back into compliance and by removing sanctions that the U.S. imposed after the Trump administration withdrew from the pact in 2018.


Republicans and Immigrants Need Each Other
We have been thinking about the Republican Party and how it can come back—worthily, constructively—after the splits and shatterings of recent years. The GOP is relatively strong in the states but holds neither the White House, House nor Senate and in presidential elections struggles to win the popular vote. Entrenched power centers are arrayed against it, increasingly including corporate America. But parties have come back from worse. The Democrats came back from being on the wrong side in the Civil War.
Some thoughts here on Republicans and immigration.
From Pew Research's findings on U.S. immigrants, published in August 2020: America has more immigrants than any other nation on earth. More than 40 million people living here were born in another country. According to the government's 2020 Current Population Survey, when you combine immigrants and their U.S.-born children the number adds up to 85.7 million. Pew estimates that most (77%) are here legally, including naturalized citizens. Almost a quarter are not.
Where are America's immigrants from? Twenty-five percent, the largest group, are from Mexico, according to Pew. After that China at 6%, India just behind, the Philippines at 4%, El Salvador at 3%.
America hasn't had so many first- and second-generation Americans since the great European wave of the turn of the last century. The political party that embraces this reality, that becomes part of it, will win the future.


Blinken Offers Assurances in Afghanistan, but Some Voice Skepticism
KABUL, Afghanistan—U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Afghan leaders and citizens that U.S. support for their country would continue during and after a planned U.S. troop withdrawal ordered this week by President Biden.
But some of those with whom Mr. Blinken met during an unannounced visit Thursday voiced anxiety over the U.S. plan to begin withdrawing its remaining 3,500 troops on May 1 and to complete the pullout by Sept. 11.
"My views are very pessimistic," said Naheed Farid, a member of Parliament who leads the women's affairs committee, when asked about Afghanistan's future.
The insurgent Taliban movement, meanwhile, issued a statement denouncing the withdrawal plan, which pushes back a May 1 troop withdrawal negotiated last year between the militant group and the Trump administration.
"Now, as the agreement is being breached by America, it in principle opens the way for the Mujahideen of Islamic Emirate to take every necessary countermeasure, hence the American side will be held responsible for all future consequences, and not the Islamic Emirate," the statement said.


FedEx's Limits on Phones in Spotlight After Indianapolis Shooting
When a gunman began shooting at a FedEx Corp. facility in Indianapolis late Thursday night, many workers didn't have access to their mobile phones to call for help or loved ones.
FedEx policy prohibits most workers from having cellphones inside the company's sprawling sortation centers, citing safety reasons. Some workers leave them in their vehicles or lockers before starting their shifts. The situation prompted some people on social media to criticize the delivery company for its policy.
Indianapolis police officials said the cellphone policy didn't appear to delay the reporting of the deadly shooting to authorities. Police said many FedEx workers didn't have their phones after the late-night incident, which delayed their ability to reach family members.
"That was certainly frustrating for those employees as well as their families," Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Deputy Chief Craig McCartt said at a news conference Friday.
A FedEx spokeswoman said only some workers are authorized to have access to their phones in certain areas of FedEx Ground facilities, in order to "minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations."


Ohio Politics Is Changing Rapidly Beneath a Stable Surface
On the surface, Ohio looks like an island of calm after the turbulent 2020 election: Donald Trump won the state by 8.07 points in 2016 and won it again by 8.02 points in 2020.
But underneath those stable results, the state saw significant swings at the county level that suggest forces are at work remaking the electorate.
Delaware County, just north of Columbus, the state capital, moved away from Mr. Trump by 9 percentage points. Pike County, 90 minutes to the south, moved toward him by 12 points.
Both have voted for the Republican candidate for president in every election since 2000, including 2020. But stark demographic differences between them illustrate larger political shifts in Ohio and beyond.
Delaware County is growing, and Pike is shrinking. More than half the adult population in Delaware has a college degree. In Pike, the figure is about 13%. Delaware's median household income is well over double that of Pike. The population in both counties is mostly white, though Pike's is more so. And in the past few elections the two have changed places. Delaware, once solidly GOP, voted for Mr. Trump by less than 7 percentage points, and Pike—once a hotly contested battleground that Republican Mitt Romney won by a single vote in 2012—gave Mr. Trump a 49-point margin of victory in 2020.


Want Infrastructure? Build Shipyards
A portion of President Biden's $2 trillion American Jobs Plan would fund roads, bridges and railways, but one essential piece of infrastructure is overlooked entirely: the U.S. shipbuilding base.
For years there has been a bipartisan consensus that the U.S. Navy should grow to 355 ships from 296. But a larger, more capable Navy needs shipyards to build and maintain the fleet. During World War II, the U.S. had 10 large Navy yards with drydocks and repair facilities, as well as more than 40 commercial drydocks. Today there are only four industrial Navy yards, in Hawaii, Maine, Virginia and Washington state. By my count, fewer than 20 commercial sites are certified for naval use.
There simply isn't enough capacity to expand and service the fleet, which is why the Navy hasn't grown much even as its budget has expanded. The production of Virginia-class fast-attack submarines and Burke-class destroyers has fallen six to 12 months behind schedule even as lawmakers say they want to buy more of these ships.
Maintenance has fallen even further behind. The USS Boise, a fast-attack submarine, was scheduled to start maintenance in 2015 at the Navy shipyard in Norfolk, Va. But Norfolk was backed up with other maintenance, and eventually the sub was moved to a commercial yard in nearby Newport News. The delay ate up more than three years, or about 10% of the ship's service life, the Congressional Budget Office reports.
Things are likely to get worse. Only one of the Navy's drydocks, No. 8 in Norfolk, is big enough to hold the new Ford-class aircraft carrier, which is scheduled to replace Nimitz-class carriers over the next few decades. Even worse, more than 50 ships need to be retired in the next few years, largely because the Navy has been unable to maintain them sufficiently over the past two decades.
